00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,963
Hello.
Charlie Kelly here,

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:09,801
local business owner
and cat enthusiast.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:13,971
Is your cat making
too much noise all the time?

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:19,310
Is your cat constantly stomping
around, driving you crazy?

5
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,271
[Roaring] [Glass Shattering]

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,608
Is your cat clawing
at your furnitures?

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,152
[Growling]
Think there's no answer?

8
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,822
You're so stupid! There is.

9
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,032
Kitten Mittens.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,496
Finally, there's an elegant,
comfortable mitten for cats.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,581
[Crickets Chirping]

12
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:46,212
- [Cat Yowls]
- I couldn't hear anything.

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,425
Is your cat one-legged?
Is your cat fat, skinny or an in-between?

14
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,511
That doesn't matter,
'cause one size fits all.

15
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,888
Kitten Mittens.
You'll be smitten.

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,224
So come on down to Paddy's Pub.

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,894
We're the home
of the original Kitten Mittens.

18
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,564
Mee-ow!

19
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,858
[Button Clicks]

20
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:51,068
So, lately at night, I've been forced
to fall asleep to the deafening sound...

21
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,864
of, like, a hundred alley cats
tapping on my windows, trying to get in.

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,784
You know what I mean?
Thus, Kitten Mittens.

23
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,328
Right? I'm making a quieter cat.

24
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,247
And then I made the sales tape when I
heard about the merchandising convention.

25
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,916
- Ooh, question.
- Mac, go.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,168
Thank you.
Uh, what merchandising convention?

27
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,170
They're having one down
at the Sheraton. All right?

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,257
So I figured, what a better place
to, like, find investors for my product.

29
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,469
What do moronic Kitten Mittens
have to do with our bar?

30
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,222
Okay. One, they're not moronic.
They're awesome. [Dennis] Mmm.

31
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,307
And two, uh, nothing.

32
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,352
Look, Charlie, I kinda like this.
I might jump in on this with you here.

33
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,395
I think it's a good idea.
We could do T-shirts.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,648
We could do beach towels,
those nudie pens.

35
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,567
[Laughs] Okay. It's about time, you
know, we get some merchandise in here,

36
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,736
and I start making some
money off this place. What?

37
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,197
What are you talking about?
You're not gonna make any money of this place.

38
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,407
You don't own a piece of the bar.
No, but I own...

39
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,243
a hundred percent
of the merchandising.

40
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,245
It's in my contract.
What contract?

41
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,747
The contract you had me sign
when I first started working here.

42
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,707
What?
[Scoffs] [Laughs]

43
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,753
Dee, we got you to sign that contract so
we could pay you less than minimum wage.

44
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,798
Okay? We're never gonna
merchandise anything in the bar.

45
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,800
But now we are.

46
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,553
To be honest, I don't even remember
signing any kind of contract.

47
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,555
Oh, you don't remember?
Did it slip your mind?

48
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,557
That's okay,
'cause it's right here.

49
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,934
I keep it in this drawer
so that you two jerks don't try...

50
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,936
Hey, hey! Wait!
What are you doing?

51
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,438
- Oh!
- You son of a bitch!

52
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,982
That doesn't nullify it,
you know?

53
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,942
Oh, why?
Do you have another copy?

54
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,611
I... don't.

55
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,865
I don't, but you can't
just go eat a contract!

56
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,951
- He just did eat it. - All right.
I'm talking to a lawyer about this.

57
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,536
You don't have a leg to stand on.

58
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,121
Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah!

59
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,248
This is making me think
maybe I should slap a patent...

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,876
on my Kitten Mittens before you guys
try and steal that too, huh?

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,879
I can see it in your eyes.
You're all over this, aren't you?

62
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,132
[Swallows] You know,
I gotta say, Mac,

63
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,218
my instinct to steal
this idea is very strong.

64
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,722
Kitten Mittens? No, idiot.
Merchandising in the bar.

65
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,724
Yeah. I'm thinking we take this
merchandising convention...

66
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,435
as an opportunity to make
merchandise for Paddy's. Right.

67
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,813
You know? Like, expand our brand.
You know? Make a little "mon-ay"!

68
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:55,151
Who's gonna buy merchandise
to a bar that they've never been to?

69
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,361
Uh, hello, Frank.
[Chuckles]

70
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,946
I've never been to Fiji.

71
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,533
All right. Well, how about, like,
hard-boiled eggs from Paddy's Bar?

72
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,702
Green eggs.
Says "Paddy's" on them.

73
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,496
You keep them on your desk
when you go to work.

74
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,291
Who's gonna want to keep a hard-boiled
egg on their desk at work?

75
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,835
Oh, all right. Then you put it
on your dashboard of your car.

76
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,047
It's just a jumping-off point.
Frank, keeping hard-boiled eggs...

77
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,342
on your desktop or the dashboard of
your car is not a jumping-off point.

78
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,511
Get the hell out of here, all right?
Let us concentrate on doing the merchandising idea.

79
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,056
Clearly you don't get it.
So I don't want- I don't get it?

80
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,891
You don't get it!
I don't get it?

81
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,560
You don't get it! Oh, yeah?
We'll see who doesn't get it!

82
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,728
Okay!
Yeah!

83
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,854
All right!

84
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,609
All right, Charlie. Remember, this
lawyer is not a big fan of ours.

85
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,320
So we're probably gonna have to turn the
charm up a little bit in the beginning.

86
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,614
Know what I mean?
I got a plan on how we can do that too.

87
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,407
See this picture of his
wife right here? Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,078
What if we compliment her good looks?
That gets us off on a good foot, right?

89
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,746
Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,040
That woman looks like a stone-cold
bitch, and you know it.

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,917
And he knows it 'cause he turns
the picture away from him.

92
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,127
Well, I'm trying to
make lemonade here. Oh!

93
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,380
Ooh, there he is.
How did you get in here?

94
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,382
Hey!
Aw, we just...

95
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,551
There's the man! The old-fashioned
way- with doors and feet and walking.

96
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,639
You know, we were just having a
conversation about how lovely your wife is.

97
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,432
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Very lovely.

98
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,185
I was not participating in that conversation,
'cause I don't find her lovely.

99
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,479
I think you're better than that.
I think you can do better than that.

100
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,064
And I mean that
as a compliment.

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,775
You are aware that there are
other lawyers in Philadelphia?

102
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,819
But the three of us have a history.
Sure.

103
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,530
We, uh- We have a past, if you will.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,116
And Charlie and I really like
the fact that you don't charge.

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,577
I do charge.
Okay? You don't pay.

106
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,039
We're both men of the law.
You know?

107
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,543
We get after it. You know?
We jabber-jaw. We go tit for tat.

108
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,712
We have our little differences.

109
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,840
But at the end of the day,
you win some, I win some,

110
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,093
and there's a mutual respect
left over between us. No.

111
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,555
Any respect that you're feeling that's
coming from me is a mistake on your part.

112
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,434
Then I'll just regress, 'cause I feel like
I've made myself perfectly redundant.

113
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,394
- Yes, you have.
- I'm lost.

114
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,564
So I'm just gonna get down to brass tacks.
I got a question for you.

115
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:01,902
Does a legal document hold up in a court of law
if it has been ingested by the other party?

116
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,363
- I'm not- - Now, mind you,
the heretofore document...

117
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,993
had- had dry ink on it
for at least many "forknights,"

118
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,038
uh, hereto- We signed
it a long time ago.

119
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,040
It was a long time ago signed.

120
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,417
I'm also gonna need a patent
for the Kitten Mittens.

121
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,545
I'm sure you do. I was gonna ask you,
"Hey, need Kitten Mitten patents?"

122
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,714
That's them.
I'm sorry, sir.

123
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,799
But they locked me in a closet.

124
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,098
Yo, dude, dude, dude.
I'm ready to show you my idea.

125
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,933
Me too. All right,
let me go first, bro.

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,644
Let me show you mine, then you can go first.
Then I'd be going second.

127
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,730
Yeah, great. Okay, now listen.
When we're selling stuff...

128
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,232
at Paddy's, I think we need to be
selling a certain attitude, right?

129
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,943
One that reflects our take-no-prisoners,
rock-and-roll lifestyle.

130
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,028
Okay.
Yeah?

131
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,947
Yeah. Now what says
that more than this?

132
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,408
Huh?

133
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,828
Paddy's thong, dude!
Paddy's thong!

134
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,872
You're wearing women's underwear?
Yeah, bro!

135
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,874
You bet your ass
I'm wearing women's underwear.

136
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,252
What's more sexual than a high-waisted
thong riding high up a woman's backside?

137
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,923
Nothing. Dude, come on.
Paddy's thong is gonna be a huge hit with chicks.

138
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,926
Okay. All right. Uh, question.
Yeah, Mac. Go.

139
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,637
Dennis, are women gonna wanna
buy their underpants in a bar?

140
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,639
No. Women will not buy
their underwear in a bar,

141
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,933
but men will buy the underwear
for their women in a bar...

142
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,643
because it's not for women,
it's for men.

143
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,145
It's a visual stimulant, bro.
I'm not wearing these because I'm comfortable.

144
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm wearing them because I want to turn you on.
You know what I'm saying?

145
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,441
You get it?
Yeah.

146
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,318
Yeah, bro. It's visual stimulation.
Okay. Yeah.

147
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,986
Can I go now?
Yeah, sure.

148
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,155
I've been waiting for a long time.
Okay. Okay, I'm thinking to myself,

149
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,199
what do people love more than
anything else in the world?

150
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,535
They love comedy!
They do love comedy.

151
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,995
Everybody loves comedy, right?
So- And I'm funny. I can do funny.

152
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,331
But you gotta have functionality
with your comedy, okay?

153
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,625
Right. You can't just go throwing
jokes around willy-nilly.

154
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,627
Oh.
So I did one of those.

155
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,338
You drew a men's buttocks
on a towel. Yeah.

156
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,006
You get out of the shower
in the college dorm.

157
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,008
They got the butt, right?
People are laughing. Okay.

158
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,677
Your buddies are laughing.
[Laughing]

159
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,429
And then you give them one of these.
Boom! [Laughs]

160
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,182
Oh, that is big!
That's a big monster dick.

161
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,893
That's huge.
That's the biggest dick you ever seen.

162
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,687
Yeah, that's really- That's not
how you see yourself though?

163
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,689
Now that's funny. That's funny.
That is funny.

164
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,024
Yeah, people are gonna laugh at that.
But, bro, that's just the setup.

165
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,402
What is it?
For this.

166
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,611
Ding-ding-ding!

167
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,113
Oh, it's a baby dick.

168
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,073
Yeah! We're gonna sell
a million of these, dude.

169
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,117
We are gonna sell a million of those, dude.
We'll do black ones...

170
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,827
and yellow ones for the Asians.

171
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,996
That is probably more Asian than anything else.
Dude- Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

172
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,874
Maybe a little bit more bush.
We should set up a Web site for it.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,750
Already did it.
You did?

174
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,919
Dicktowel.com.

175
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,713
Dicktowel.com.
[Laughs]

176
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,632
Well, you don't think I know what's going on?
Huh? Oh, Jesus Christ!

177
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,676
I don't get it? Huh?
Open your mouth, bitch. What?

178
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,470
Prepare to be blasted, bitch!
Brenda! [Muffled Screaming]

179
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,265
[Groans, Spits, Coughs]
[Frank Laughs]

180
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,475
This is my new
merchandising idea.

181
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,062
It's a gun that shoots liquor
into your mouth!

182
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,981
You threw tequila in my eye!

183
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,610
Well, I haven't figured out how to get the
tequila to come out of the barrel of the gun.

184
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,279
But I'm working on it.
What the hell does she have to do with anything?

185
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,281
Check her out.
I mean, she's gorgeous.

186
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,535
You bring a woman with cans like that into the
convention, you sell the idea in a second.

187
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,871
So this is your plan?
You're gonna go into the convention...

188
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,540
waving a gun in people's faces,
throwing tequila in everybody's eyes...

189
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,959
with a big-titted woman?
Duh, yeah!

190
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,170
Frank, get the hell out of here!
Your ideas are ridiculous!

191
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,757
Okay. Okay.
Suck on this, bitches.

192
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,845
Huh? Huh?
Paddy's Pub stress ball.

193
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,848
You give this to people.
They put it on their desk.

194
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,644
And then during the day, you squeeze
it when you have any tension.

195
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,648
Right. Oh, goddamn it, Frank!
That's just an egg!

196
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,650
It's a jumping-off point.
Get out!

197
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,069
All right. Get the hell out of here!
Just get the hell out of here!

198
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,197
Don't even listen to them.
You know what I'm saying? Jesus Christ.

199
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,533
Okay, we're stealing that gun shot idea, right?
Gun shot idea's awesome.

200
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,704
You see any sign of that
lawyer or his secretary?

201
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,791
No, and I don't know why you think we're
gonna catch him having an affair.

202
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,293
I mean, the guy's wife is really hot.
No, she's not.

203
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,587
And also, why does he turn
her picture away from him...

204
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,589
so he doesn't have
to look at her face?

205
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,384
Why are we in this shady motel
where we saw him go in?

206
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,386
I'm telling you, he's-
he's banging that secretary.

207
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,096
I don't know.
It just doesn't add up.

208
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,348
She's an attractive lady, you know?
She's not attractive.

209
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,016
Oh, my God!
What?

210
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,018
The woman in the room
right next to him...

211
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,062
she just ate an entire
sleeve of Chips Ahoy!

212
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,523
Charlie, could you focus
on the lawyer's room, please?

213
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,943
We're not here to blackmail a lady
for eating too many cookies.

214
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,737
Did you say an entire sleeve though?
An entire sleeve.

215
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,906
That's a lot of cookies.
She a big lady?

216
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,242
[Charlie] Of course.
She's a humongous lady. Yeah. Of course.

217
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,287
Oh, shit. I see him. He's walking towards the car.
He's walking towards the car!

218
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,289
Get down! Shh!
Why is he coming towards us?

219
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,083
Get down and hold still!
[Door Opens]

220
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,087
[Sighs] [Door Closes]

221
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,049
All right. Um, so what are you
people doing in my car now?

222
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,218
Okay, let me explain that.
Uh- Yeah.

223
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,138
We were staking you out last night-
kinda spying on you. Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,473
It got a little cold. It dropped down, right?
It was freezing, wasn't it?

225
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,101
Did you feel that? So we jimmied your
lock and spent the night in here.

226
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,562
Okay. Uh, so why were you
spying on me all night?

227
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,648
Because you're having an affair, and we're
gonna blackmail you for your services.

228
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,027
Okay. I hate to disappoint you,
but I am not having an affair.

229
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,362
Oh, yeah? Then why do you turn your
wife's picture away from your desk...

230
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,364
so you don't have
to look at her face?

231
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,283
Why are you staying
in this seedy motel?

232
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,285
And why does it look like
you've been crying all night?

233
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,413
I'll tell you what I think.
I think you feel guilty.

234
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,499
All right, listen.
If you must know,

235
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,754
my wife is leaving me.

236
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,382
And I have to sleep
in this fleabag motel.

237
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,011
And I am still very much in love with my wife,
which makes this divorce very difficult.

238
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,013
Thus you have the turning away
of the photo...

239
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,724
and you have, you know, the crying
episodes, and the what-have-you.

240
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,894
Mmm. Sad.

241
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,687
Okay, that's our bad.
We, uh...

242
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,689
It all comes together- That
makes a lot of sense though.

243
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,316
In a different way
than I thought.

244
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,069
God, divorce is tough.
The picture sort of coming together for you all?

245
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,029
You must be
all ripped up about that.

246
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,073
So, um- Do you want to
have a conversation...

247
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,367
about helping us out with
our Kitten Mitten patent and...

248
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,369
I thought this contract-
You know what? If, um...

249
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,746
Why don't you get out of my car?
We should go now.

250
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,331
Why don't you just
get out of my car?

251
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,832
You've had a hard
couple of days.

252
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,632
Okay, consumer, are you ready to get
blasted in the mouth by Paddy's Shotgun?

253
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,841
Yeah.
One, two, three!

254
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,427
[Gargles] Ah!

255
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,223
Goddamn it, dude!
You just cannot blast water out of a gun.

256
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,974
The technology
is just not there.

257
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,560
They did sort of figure it out with
water guns, so I don't know why...

258
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,188
Yeah, but a water gun doesn't have
the same feel to it, you know?

259
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,399
It doesn't. You want to feel the
weight of a real gun in your mouth.

260
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,360
You want to taste the metal.
You want to feel the steel, man, you know?

261
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,404
Okay, bro, new plan.
Yeah.

262
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,572
Let's just make a video,
show that at the convention.

263
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,157
Not like Charlie's video though.
Ours needs to be cool.

264
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,159
No, no, no, dude.
Way cooler than Charlie's.

265
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,161
With, like, quick cuts
and awesome music...

266
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,914
and eagles flying through the air and
picking up trout out of rivers and shit.

267
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,916
Ripping it apart and eating it, you know?
It's so cool.

268
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,042
That'll excite people.
Yeah.

269
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,544
They'll want to invest.

270
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,587
Then we'll let the brainiacs in China
figure out the technology.

271
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,550
Yeah. But the point is- is it's got
to really grab people's attention.

272
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,429
You know what I mean? All right.
I did a little tweaking and...

273
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,057
- What is that?
- Paddy's Shotgun, bro!

274
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,184
You get blasted in the mouth!
[Laughs]

275
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,312
- You stole my idea! - No, no, no, Frank.
We tweaked your idea.

276
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,982
We took what was a good idea
and we made it a great idea.

277
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,984
We're also gonna get a bustier chick.
No offense, ma'am.

278
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,986
You're very busty.
Your breasts are very large.

279
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,030
But, uh, we want to go weird with it.
We want to get really freakish.

280
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,408
I would like to get your number,
actually, though at some point.

281
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,037
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.
You can't just take somebody's idea,

282
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,248
change the name of it
and then sell it.

283
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,208
That's the American way, bro.
Yeah!

284
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,044
Yeah. Take a look at Hard Rock Cafe.
Got tweaked by Planet Hollywood.

285
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,548
Coke got tweaked by Pepsi.
Transformers got tweaked by GoBots.

286
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,884
Our job is to step aside
and let the consumer decide.

287
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,221
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna get a patent
for this and sue your balls off.

288
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,307
We're gonna get a patent too,
Frank, so screw you.

289
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,267
