1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,803
[ mac ]
well, then what would you say?
[ dennis ] she's a quitter.

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,939
[ dee ]
you know what?
I don't even care!

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,708
And that proves my point.
Because you don't care,
you never succeed.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,113
- right. Failed.
- failure implies that she
actually tried to be an actor.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,482
Okay, I did try.
It just didn't happen
to work out.

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,917
It's not your fault, sweetie.
You're just not pretty enough.

7
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,620
Oh, thank you!
That's my dad, everybody!
<i>[ door opens ]</i>

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,423
Great!
Okay, I just killed
three very large rats...

9
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,458
That were stuck in glue traps.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,427
Good work.
No, no, that's not good.

11
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,764
I am done with rat detail.
That's by far the worst job
in the bar!

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,566
That's why we call it
"charlie work."
no, dude. Not charlie work.

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,470
There's an emotional toll
that comes out of this.
I mean, you kill one of those--

14
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,806
Are you kidding me?
What? What?

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,875
You're blowing smoke
directly in my face when
I'm trying to talk to you.

16
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,178
What is he talking about?
If you want to smoke, you
should have to take it outside.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,514
- that's it. I'm done with this.
- it's a bar.

18
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,516
Yeah. It's a bar, dude.
Charlie,
I think you're right.

19
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,652
I think maybe we should ban
smoking in here.
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,654
That's completely ridiculous.
How is that ridiculous?

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,656
There are smoking bans
in a lot of states now.

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,858
Uh, yes. And it's
completely un-american.

23
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,960
If you don't like smoke,
then don't come into the bar.

24
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,263
I work in this bar.
I work here.

25
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,265
But that's because
you have the freedom
to choose to work here.

26
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,501
Smoking bans, they don't
protect freedom. They strip
'em away from smokers.

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,304
<i>Look, I didn't go</i>
<i>to vietnam...</i>

28
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,774
Just to have pansies like you
take my freedom away from me.

29
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:20,212
You went to vietnam in 1993
to open up a sweatshop!

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,548
And a lot of good men died
in that sweatshop!

31
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,550
Oh, my god!
You're out of your mind.
Look, look.

32
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,920
The point is that
if charlie took any time
to study in school,

33
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,824
He would recognize that the
constitution protects my freedom
to blow smoke all over his face.

34
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,327
You gotta be--
you don't know shit
about the constitution, man.

35
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,731
- he knows more than you two
un-american freedom haters.
- thank you.

36
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,733
Charlie, we hate freedom.
Ew, we hate it.
Hate it.

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,836
- I'm un-american?
- you're practically a vietcong.

38
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,238
Oh, is that right?
Okay, you wanna talk america?

39
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,208
You wanna learn a little
something about america?
Dee, let's roll out of here.

40
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,879
- where are we going?
- we're gonna go america
all over their asses!

41
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,415
[ man ]
it is time for the truth!

42
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,420
Five million people will die
this year of smoking-related
illnesses!

43
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,257
These body bags, these represent
the number of people...

<i>That will die</i>
<i>in this city alone today!</i>

45
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:46,231
It doesn't have to be this way!
Let's make smoking history!

<i>[ applause ]</i>

That's what america's
all about, dee!
Yeah.

51
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,046
Right here!
This is the u.S.A.!
Oh, my god!

52
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,515
That guy really knew how
to pull an audience.

53
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,652
I tell you what.
Let's get in on this.

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,955
Hey, bro.
Great job out there, man.
Oh, thanks.

55
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,491
You really--
you had me like hook, line
and sinker with that--

56
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,095
It was awesome, dude.
It was awesome. So, look,
I want in on the cause.

57
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,665
Oh, okay. Just go
to the web site
and you can check out--

58
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,202
No, I don't want to do that.
I wanna be on the front lines
like you, bro.

59
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,638
- I wanna be, like, you know,
join the team or something.
- naw, it's really complicated.

60
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,542
- there's a lot of red tape.
You really can't--
- uh, excuse me, sir.

61
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,945
But just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

62
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,015
Oh, dude. This is just
an acting gig.

63
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,484
Like, I'm not really
part of any cause.

64
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,352
- oh, you're an actor?
- mm-hmm.

65
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,655
- oh. But not a real one?
- what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

66
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,625
No, just-- I mean,
you're on the sidewalk.

67
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,828
Oh, right. Like you know
what you're talking about.
How old are you? Like, 40?

68
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,064
<i>I live in new york,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

69
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,501
Street theater is the only
organized artistic expression
that we have--

70
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,003
What a crock of shit, man!

- oh, relax? Oh, I'm gonna--

Little actor boy, you wanna
throw with a patriot?

- <i>back off! Back off!</i>
<i>- I'm not 40.</i>

74
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,082

- get in your van. Get in
your van and go, okay?

75
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,352
'cause I'll throw down!
I'll throw down
any day of the week!

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,021
Get in your little van
and drive out of my face! Okay?

<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Screw dee and charlie.</i>

79
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,166
I'm sick of people telling us
what we can and can't do
with our own bar, you know?

80
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,168
What happened
to this country?

81
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,203
Why can't we stay open
past 2:00 a.M.?

82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,007
Yes! And why can't
we sell booze
before noon on Sunday?

83
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,576
These are the kind of
puritanical restrictions
that are killing this country.

84
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,913
This is why people flock
to places like las vegas...

85
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,781
And new orleans
and spring break.

86
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,551
Because they're free
to go wild.
The girls go wild.

87
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,553
The girls in philly
need a place to go wild.

88
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,090
- right. New orleans was washed
away in that terrible storm.
- tragic.

89
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,892
We need to open up paddy's
as a haven for freedom.
Yes.

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,197
- a replacement for the
tragic loss of new orleans.
- we should have gambling too.

91
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,232
And we should have
gambling too.
Sure.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,135
- I'm gonna get
the ball rolling.
- okay, great.

93
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,605
We will open up paddy's
as the most american bar
in all of america!

94
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,475
- a place with absolute freedom!
- with no gambling restrictions.

95
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,045
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Listen, dude. We should head
down to sorority houses, right?

96
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,714
Spread the word, you know?
Hand out some leaflets
or something.

97
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,284
No, mac. We should go
to the library.
The library? Why?

98
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,654
Yeah, because at sorority houses
you're gonna find nothing
but tramps and whores.

99
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,590
Those girls are
already wild.
Perfect!

100
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,493
No, no. Mac,
you're not listening to me.

101
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,029
We don't want
wild girls.

102
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,732
We want real girls
going wild.

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,803
It's important to see
the transition. You want
to watch the process.

Charlie, if we're gonna put
on our own demonstration,

106
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,247
Then your body needs
to be in tip-top shape
out there.

107
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,284
My body is in tip-top shape.
Well, maybe for a small,
fat person. Not for an actor.

108
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,787
Fat person?
A chunky-- chunky--

109
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,889
A chunky person?
Where are you getting that?
A husky person.

Really?

All right, forget it.

I'm not an actor anyway.
I know.

113
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,701
Yeah. Well, then
I'm a protestor, right?
I'm a patriot. Give me that.

114
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,469
Okay.
That's my bag.

115
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,671

to feed me some lines.

116

I can feed you lines.
And then I'll go from there.

need all the--
I can take over.

Let's focus on
finding your breath.

119
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,348
What?
Where is your breath?

120
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,184
In my mouth?
No, it starts in your chest.

121
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,821
You got to focus
on your diaphragm.
What the hell's a diaphragm?

122
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,724
Right here.
Putting your diaphragm--
no. The diaphragm is a--

123
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,060
No. Really? That's all you know?
It blocks
the babies out.

Yeah.

Yeah, I am.
Your body could betray you...

In any number of ways--
like how?

You're wild!
Way to go!
<i>You girls went wild!</i>

141
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,178
Nice. This is what
it was like to have
a bar in new orleans, bro.

142
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,480
Oh, man! New orleans really
had their shit figured out!

143
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,883
Oh, they totally had
their shit figured out.
Yeah!

144
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,686
Except for the levees.
Right, yeah.
Except for the levees.

145
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,921
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, and the evacuation plan.

146
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,924
Hey, oh!
Oh! You've gone wild!

147
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,893
You've gone wild!
You've gone wild!
You went wild!

148
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,828
This is what
america's all about!
This is america!

149
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,930
We have set up
an american utopia!
Yeah!

150
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,900
That could be
a bit of a problem
back there though.

151
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,369
[ chattering in vietnamese ]

152
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:55,240
[ mac ]
yeah, that could get weird.
<i>Yeah, it's really smoky.</i>

153
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,210
I didn't want to say it because
of the spirit of this whole
thing. But I think you're right.

154
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,446
<i>It's a little much.</i>
<i>These fellows</i>
<i>don't mess around.</i>

155
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,582
This is high-stakes shit.
You think you can get one...

156
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,152
Of these white broads to come
over and do a table dance
for alan and the boys?

157
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,688
No table dances, okay?
That's what we were
worried about.

158
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,858
Listen, frank. If you can
keep those guys as far jammed
into that corner as possible--

159
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,294
- push 'em into the corner.
- whoa, whoa, whoa. Segregation!

160
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,565
That's segregation! That's not
what this is all about.
America is a melting pot.

161
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,401
- but it might be good to
set up some boundaries.
- boundaries?

162
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,237
Sounds like it's coming
right out of stalin's mouth.

163
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,706
Stalin's mouth? That is not
what we're talking about.
We're just saying--

164
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,976
I don't know who stalin is.
Who the hell is stalin?
How do you not know?

165
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,078
Listen, man.
Just keep them under control.

166
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,280
You betcha. Oh, here.

167
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,618
They want you to play this
vietnamese music. They don't
like what's playing here.

168
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,654
Okay, listen. Compromise.
Tonight we keep things
the way they are.

169
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,656
Tomorrow night,
we'll play this shit.

170
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,159
Good. I gotta get back there
now because alan...

171
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:51,397
Is just about to bet
his wife's glass eye
in the next hand.

172
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,403
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are about to speak the truth.

173
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,972
We're not gonna spout a bunch
of words that are facts,

174
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,875
Like some big jerk from new york
who thinks he's great.

175
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,879
We're gonna show you
a dramatic interpretation.
[ clears throat ]

Hello, young man.
I'm a bigwig from big tobacco.

177
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:13,519
I work over here
at t.J. Boris. Can I offer
you a cigarette?

178
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,627
Goddamn it, charlie!

Let's try and look
at the bright side here.

181
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,006
This music sounds like whales
raping each other.

182
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,909
It does. It does indeed.
But the t-shirts
are working.

183
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,679
Isn't that amazing? You ask
to see a woman's breasts
on the street, you get slapped.

184
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,048
You give her a free t-shirt
and videotape it, and
the clothes come right off.

185
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,217
I love this country.
Hey, yo!
Yeah.

186
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,953
Hey, sweetie.
You want a t-shirt?
Okay.

Whoa! Come on, pal!
Dude.

What are you doing?
You're blowing up our spot!

192
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,234
You're just standing there?
Take a walk!

193
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,970
[ sighs ]
maybe it's time
we set up some rules.

194
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,407
We can't do that. No rules.
Your father is killing
our freedom!

195
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,642
I know! I know!
Hey. Hey, you still want
that t-shirt?

196
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,745
Yeah.
Yeah? All right.

197
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,381
- okay, any time you're ready.
- okay.

Oh, what? What's wrong now?
Ruined again!

- hey, man.

I thought you guys
were in jail.
Parole.

201
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:29,695
We heard you guys have
a, uh, "anything goes"
type situation here.

202
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,731
Can we get a couple glasses
of milk?
What? No.

No. You can't have milk.
You can't have milk. No.

Come on, man.
Oh, for-- you know what?
Get out of here.

205

Could you guys go over there
for a second? We gotta talk for
a second. If you could just--

206
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,179
What are we gonna do?
I did not see this coming.

207
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,548
We cannot have the mcpoyle
brothers in here creeping
everybody out.

208
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,118
What if charlie comes in here?
He sent them to jail. They
may be planning to stab him.

They bang each other,
dennis.

210

And they bang each other.
They bang each other's--

Okay, guys, you can stay.
But none of your weird shit.

All right, listen.
We've heard some things
about you two.

215
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,341

the specifics. We just don't
want it in the bar, okay?

216

It's a free country, bitch.

217

We may have a problem
on our hands, dude.

218
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,226
Do we have any sharp knives?

219
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:38,230
What?
These guys are maniacs. They
wanna start bettin' fingers.

Fingers?
What are you talking about?

221

If alan loses this hand,
he's gonna start chopping
off his fingers.

like it in my life!

freedom's all about.
I'm living on the edge.

Okay, we're gonna find
a compromise here,
all right?

227
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,717
Uh, we'll take the bar and
you can have the basement!
Yes!

228
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,252
You want to put me
in the basement?

229
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,788
Yeah. You can do
whatever you want!
Anything goes in the basement!

230
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,924
- if I go in the basement,
I can do anything I want?
- anything you want!

231
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,094
- no holds barred?
There's no limits?
- no limits!

232
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,364
None.
All right.
I'll take the basement.

233
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,702
- great.
- and now, if you don't mind,
I'll take those knives.

234
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,539
All right. Get the knives.
Yeah. And use 'em.

happened in here?

<i>Come to join the party, huh?</i>

00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,287
- no. We came back to work.
- oh, have you?

239
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,923
I guess
the strike's over, mac.
The workers have returned.

240
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,826
Uh, I wasn't on strike, okay?
I still need to make a living.

241
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,596
What in the hell has been
going on in here? And where
is that music coming from?

242
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,466
From the basement. Frank
and the boys have been
rocking all night long.

243
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,635
- doing what?
- I have no idea.
But I bet it's fun.

244
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,704
We've had a line
of 50 people outside
every night.

245
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,972
Yep. See, our bar is
about fun and freedom.

246
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,974
I don't know if you guys
have ever heard of that.
Freedom?

How could you
do this to me?

258
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,109
Okay, charlie. We don't want
them in the bar either, okay?
But freedom has a price.

259
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,111
The mcpoyles are
probably gonna stab me.

260

If freedom has its price--
I can't believe you guys!
You know what?

Let me kick down a little thing
to you that our founding fathers
kicked down to me.

and right now you guys
are treading all over me!

Dee, let's roll.
I don't want
to go with you.

What?
Mm-mmm.

265
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,895
You're my actor.
I need you.
But you're so bad at protesting.

I don't want to go.

I'm not treading on you.

You're treading on me.
And you're not supposed to!

269
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,738
I don't want to go.
Are you kidding me?
Is everyone gonna tread on me?

270
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,174
Oh, my god. Okay. Okay.

271
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,176

I'm gonna kick a little ass

[ door opens, closes ]
so you're still trying
to be an actor then?

279
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,566
- shut your mouth, dennis.
- so now I can
call her a failure.

280
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,835
I am not a failure.
Dennis, what is it
that you call it...

281
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,438
When somebody tries to do
something but doesn't succeed?
Oh, yeah.

282
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,007
Uh, that would, in fact,
be a failure.
Dee's a failure.

283
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,343
Okay. You want
to see some acting?
You want to see some acting?

284
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,714
Guess what.
I am gonna act the shit
out of somebody's ass.

285
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,819
So here's the thing, artemis.
I know last time
we saw each other,

286
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,621
Things got kind of awkward
when you licked
my brother's face.

287
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,924
But I need some help
from an actor...

288
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,828
'cause I've been doing this gig
with my friend charlie, and
he is really bringing me down.

289
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,798
Oh. Not everyone
has the gift.
Hmm.

290
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,001
Want to smoke some hash?

291
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,505
No. Thank you.
So can you help me here?

292
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,640
What's the venue?
The sidewalk.

293
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,310
I don't do sidewalks.
Okay. See, that's
what I thought.

294
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,712
But then I realized
if you think about it,

295
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,183
Street performing,
it's the last true form of
organic artistic expression.

296
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,286
Is that so?
Yes. I think you and
I need to get out there.

297
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,023
We need to prove
to the world
that we still got it.

298
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,892
[ chuckles ]
sweet, sweet dee,

299
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,329
It's not something
you can lose, okay?

300
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,698
Right. So let's go
show the world.

301
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,634
Is there any nudity involved?

302
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:39,138
No.
Can there be?

303
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,074
No.

304
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,410
I'll do it anyway.

Mcpoyles.
Mcpoyles everywhere, dude.

308
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,359
Girls don't want to go wild
in this environment,
not even for t-shirts!

309
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:04,496

to ask you something.
- what?

310
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,331
- she's mute, dude.
- mute?

311
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,267
Okay, what?

312
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,903
She wants to show you
her boobies.
<i>What?</i>

313

No! No! No!
No. No.

with you people?
That's your sister!

Hey, man.
There's nothing wrong with us.
We're just expressing ourselves.

318
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,517
Society has the problem.

319
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,957
Where do you keep
your pledge?

320
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,959
Get out of here.
Get the hell out of here.

321
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,695
Go away. Go with
your brother and sister.
Take a walk.

322
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,465
Dee, thank you so much
for this acting opportunity.

323
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,668
I can tell it is going to be
a glorious performance.

324
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,138
Those guys are full
of shit, artemis.
There's not 50 people here.

325
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,807
Focus, dee, focus!
But that's the reason
why we're here.

326
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,844
Those guys said there
would be a big crowd.
We'll draw them in.

327
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:56,548
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, please gather around.

328
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,718
You're about to see

Take yourselves
to the foggy streets
of london.

The year is 1888.

331

There's a killer on the loose.
His name, jack the ripper.

Two women walking alone home
from a holiday cotillion.

you're gonna get cancer and die!

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, man!
What are you doing?
Tying off.

340
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,154
No! No! No!
Go tie off somewhere else!

341
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,623

do whatever we want.
Give me the hose.

342
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,658

Whoa, he's got a knife!

343

Okay, great.
He's got a knife.
Of course he does! Why not?

Keep the little rubber hose!
Good luck with that.

Good life decision, man.

346
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,168
Mac, I think we gave people
too much freedom.

347
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,170
Yeah, you're right, man.
I'll call the cops.

348
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,539
No, no, no, no, no.
We can't call the cops.
That's admitting failure.

349
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,908
Dennis, we gave people
too much freedom.
That's the problem!

350
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,578
All they do is exploit it!
It's becomes anarchy. That is
not what america is all about.

to act anymore. I quit.

for the rest of my life.

Can you imagine an america
where everyone just gives up?

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,340
I don't care.
Okay, great.
Let's just give up!

and shove it in my face?
