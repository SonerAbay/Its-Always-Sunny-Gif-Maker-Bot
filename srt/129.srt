1
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:11,107
What's going on with you, man?

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,375
Are you limping?

3
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:13,944
Uh, no, I've just been working out

4
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:15,779
on this new exercise bike I got,

5
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:18,114
- and my glutes are, like, so sore.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:18,147 --> 00:00:19,315
Know what it is?
- Oh.

7
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:20,983
- Yeah, big-time, big-time.
- Howdy.

8
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:23,720
- Hi.
- It's... it's very windy today, isn't it?

9
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:24,720
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:26,790
Oh, man, look at this.

11
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,490
Dog shit.

12
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:30,559
Did you just step in that on purpose?

13
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:32,963
Oh, no, I just...
you know, I didn't really see it.

14
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,180
You pointed it out to me!

15
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:35,815
And then you stepped directly in it.

16
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,684
- Since when do you read?
- What? Nothing. No.

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,509
Books are stupid.

18
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:40,906
I don't. I was just...

19
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:43,646
It wasn't... like, I didn't time it out.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,783
- I mean, why would I do that?
- I have no idea.

21
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,117
- Why are you still standing in it?
- It was just an accident, man.

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,686
People step in dog shit
accidentally all the time.

23
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,888
Is that a lottery scratcher?

24
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:53,857
Sometimes it's in,

25
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,793
- sometimes it's out.
- Are those mirrors?

26
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,327
- No.
- You creep.

27
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,804
Look out, faggot!

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,932
Holy shit.

29
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:21,933
God!

30
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,400
Are you okay?

31
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,771
Hey, Frank, what the hell was that?

32
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:28,906
What? I saved your life.

33
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:30,206
But you called me the "F" word.

34
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,108
So what? I'm a hero.

35
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:33,610
You used a slur, dude.

36
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,145
That's like a hate crime.

37
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,214
Yeah, that's hateful speech, man.

38
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,748
- You really can't...
- Yeah, but he saved his life.

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,115
Yeah, but you can't say
that word anymore.

40
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,617
So, which is it?

41
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:06,506
<i>You are entitled to nothing!</i>

42
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:08,169
Listen, motion to present

43
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,552
articles of confederation.

44
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:10,597
- Motion denied.
- Oh...

45
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,417
Shut up, bitch.
You don't deserve anything.

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,491
Excuse me. Hey. Can I help you?

47
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,370
Okay, look, well, usually,
we're a pretty reasonable crew.

48
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,984
- Yeah, right? I mean...
- Yeah.

49
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,202
...we have our differences,
but we settle them in house.

50
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:20,519
- Sure.
- We have a good process.

51
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:21,903
There's filibusters, the whole thing.

52
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,878
- No.
- This one's a doozy.

53
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:25,196
- Yeah, this one we can't do in-house.
- We can't... we can't...

54
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,205
That's why I wanted to
bring in a third party.

55
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:29,642
Someone to hear us out and
deliver a final verdict.

56
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:30,629
- That's you, guy.
- Yeah, that's... you.

57
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:31,617
That's you.

58
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,153
Because a great injustice
has occurred, okay?

59
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,570
Frank committed a hate crime.

60
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:36,986
I saved your life.

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,128
- But you used a slur!
- It was a slur.

62
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,674
- That's...
- You'd be dead if I didn't!

63
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,893
Okay, okay, I think I'm getting it.

64
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,706
You want me to figure out whether or not

65
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,858
a hate crime's been committed?

66
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,209
What?

67
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,196
- No.
- No, no, no, no.

68
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:48,414
- Way off. Way off.
- No, no, no, no, no.

69
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,423
Oh, no, but, no,
it's not about that at all.

70
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,236
Yeah, it's about this.

71
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,935
A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket.

72
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,188
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

73
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,888
Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,765
to figure out which of you is entitled

75
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:01,984
to a two-dollar scratcher?

76
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,971
- Now you're getting it.
- Me.

77
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,651
- He's getting it.
- Now he gets it.

78
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,725
The thing is, each one of us
feels that we're entitled

79
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,043
to that ticket, and we need you

80
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,658
- to tell us who it belongs to.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,060
Why don't you scratch it
and see if it's worthless,

82
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:14,598
and then you wouldn't have
to go through all of this?

83
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,650
- Okay, so he's not getting it.
- What?!

84
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:16,936
- Is he serious?
- Do you not want a job?

85
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,812
Hold on. Is it Phil? Is your name Phil?

86
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,460
- Yeah, Phil, yeah.
- It is Phil?

87
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,547
It's Phil.

88
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,423
This ticket represents hope, okay?

89
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,038
Potential... yeah?

90
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,388
Promise.

91
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,845
The very foundation upon
which this group rests, eh?

92
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:30,833
- Yes.
- And that hope

93
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,382
belongs to me.

94
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,127
It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!

95
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,981
Please, stop.

96
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:40,845
Each of you will have an
opportunity to plead your case.

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,776
The only rule I have is that
you each treat each other

98
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:46,938
with respect and common courtesy.

99
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,276
Do we all agree to those terms?

100
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,492
Well, we would like to thank you so much

101
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,370
for taking our case so last-minute.

102
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,147
The other guy was not our style.

103
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:59,386
Well, I'm very happy to do so.

104
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,758
I do have a few questions.

105
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,075
- Fire away. - Yup.
- Of course, yeah.

106
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,962
Now, the ticket in question,
uh, who purchased it?

107
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:07,951
- Me! Thank you.
- Well...

108
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:09,005
That was me, and that's why

109
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:10,651
- this whole thing is so cut and dry.
- It's...

110
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,935
Hold on. I purchased the ticket,

111
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,537
and therefore the ticket belongs to me.

112
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,930
<i>I actually bought the ticket
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

113
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,662
<i>But I didn't realize it was
gonna be so goddamn blustery</i>

114
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,768
<i>that afternoon.</i>

115
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,076
<i>And as I was putting
my book into my purse,</i>

116
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,644
<i>the ticket flew out and
landed on the ground.</i>

117
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:31,597
So, you purchased the ticket
two weeks ago.

118
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,684
I did.

119
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,990
And why hadn't you
scratched the ticket yet?

120
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,361
Oh... well, that's because

121
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:39,007
nobody ever wins those tickets, right?

122
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,786
But as long as you don't scratch it,

123
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,103
then you're not a loser.

124
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:45,199
You know, in fact, you're a winner.

125
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,582
Potentially.

126
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:48,557
- God, Dee...
- That is so sad!

127
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,546
- It's so pathetic.
- What are...

128
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,962
- It is pathetic.
- So sad.

129
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,313
What are you talking... You just said

130
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,893
this exact same thing,
like, ten minutes ago,

131
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,913
talking about how the ticket

132
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:55,935
represented hope and all that bullshit.

133
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,701
Somehow coming from you,
it just came off so sad.

134
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,579
Well, hold on a second.
Motion for sub-arbitration

135
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,226
to determine whether or not that's sad.

136
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,806
Motion accepted. All in favor?

137
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,794
Aye.

138
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:05,946
Motion passed. It's sad, Dee.

139
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,099
I'd also like to point out

140
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,208
that while Dee's version is the truth,

141
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,886
it's not the whole truth.

142
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,642
<i>Why don't we talk about the
contents of Dee's purse?</i>

143
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,112
<i>The scratcher ticket,
the candy sour worms,</i>

144
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,165
<i>the pack of cigarettes.</i>

145
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,966
<i>Now, what I want to know is...</i>

146
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:23,565
<i>how can a woman who makes
less than minimum wage</i>

147
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,037
<i>afford such impulse buys?</i>

148
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,869
So, you're smoking now, Dee?

149
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,383
Is this about your weight?

150
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,689
Because if it is,
you're already too bony.

151
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:34,335
No, I don't think so.
I mean, I think you're

152
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,455
getting pretty tubby
in the midsection area.

153
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:36,872
- What?
- Like a bird.

154
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,222
No, no, that's fine.

155
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,922
Her hands are becoming a
major problem for me though.

156
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,735
I have Parkinson's disease.

157
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,018
What?

158
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,851
Well, at least I have a 46% chance

159
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:49,651
of getting Parkinson's disease,
according to a DNA test I took.

160
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,351
The medical journal was
because I'm trying to learn

161
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,557
as much as I can about this, you know?

162
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:55,744
And, you guys, according to that,

163
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,554
smoking can reduce your risk of...

164
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,661
Oh, my God, who gives a shit?!

165
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,441
- What?
- Dee, this isn't about whether or not

166
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,451
you have some horrific
neurological disease

167
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,262
or whether or not your
hands are the right size.

168
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:07,403
They are, by the way,
but your elbows are a mess.

169
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,587
They're too sharp.

170
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:09,510
I don't like it. They're stabbing me.

171
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,892
- That's what it is.
- You got it.

172
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:12,540
That's not the point,
that's not the point.

173
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,492
The point is:
how can you actually afford to smoke?

174
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,467
You see, Dee and I had a deal.

175
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,620
I give her money for coffee

176
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,266
every morning on the way to work.

177
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,836
<i>And she's instructed to give</i>

178
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,647
<i>a very generous tip
to the cashier, Cassie.</i>

179
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:30,225
<i>"This is from my boss, Dennis."</i>

180
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,551
<i>Now, this establishes both
generosity and authority.</i>

181
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,264
Possibly a little dominance.

182
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:36,812
It's all a very choreographed dance

183
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,030
between two soon-to-be lovers.

184
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:40,007
Ah...

185
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,016
Cassie's underage.

186
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,385
No, no, no, what-what?
What are you talking about?

187
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,133
Cassie is not underage.

188
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,010
Cassie is 21 years old.

189
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:50,644
<i>So, the champagne I was purchasing</i>

190
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,049
<i>was to celebrate her
legal drinking status.</i>

191
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,629
<i>And to honor her full maturity.</i>

192
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,955
You see, I was waiting
for Cassie to mature.

193
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,635
You know, much like an IRA.

194
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,106
Y-You put the money in, then you wait.

195
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,708
And then you make a hefty withdrawal.

196
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:07,999
Okay, yeah, sure.

197
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,635
Before full maturity, yeah, ew.

198
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:11,885
Yeah, but weren't you just saying

199
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,027
that you were doing
deposits before maturity?

200
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,838
Uh, no, no, no, no.
See, that's where you're wrong.

201
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:18,309
No, I was, uh,
between the ages of 18 and 21,

202
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:19,791
simply making investments.

203
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,338
But not for early deposits?

204
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:23,150
Well, deposits
are part of the withdrawal.

205
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,586
Sometimes I can't make a deposit at all.

206
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,102
Ugh, come on, man.

207
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:28,091
Just...

208
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,407
Okay, just to be clear:

209
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:30,857
a deposit's a load, right?

210
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,569
- Yeah.
- Well, yeah, yeah.

211
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,558
That's not what I'm talking about.

212
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,105
No, it's a totally different...

213
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,751
- Are you sure?
- No, with my... no.

214
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:39,057
Look, not in this particular case,
it's not a lo...

215
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,079
It's-it's...

216
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:43,767
Yeah, it's a load.

217
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,248
- Yeah. I mean, yeah.
- But that's not the point!

218
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,467
That's not the point! The point is:

219
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,543
Dee has no rightful
claim to that ticket,

220
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,023
and I'll prove it.

221
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:51,769
<i>You see, yesterday,</i>

222
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,482
<i>after noticing the
contents of her purse,</i>

223
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,182
<i>I decided to follow her this morning.</i>

224
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,401
<i>Cassie never gets her tip,</i>

225
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,049
does she, Dee?

226
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,024
No. Because I refuse to tip for coffee.

227
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:03,000
- I think it's dumb.
- Uh-huh.

228
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,514
So if you were buying circus peanuts

229
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:05,930
and candy sour worms and cigarettes,

230
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,577
I think we all know what that means

231
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,574
about the ticket in question, don't we?

232
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,967
I don't. Do you know?

233
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,646
- No.
- Totally lost.

234
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,183
That means she bought it with my money!

235
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,060
So, technically, that ticket is mine!

236
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,740
Okay, okay, okay.

237
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,177
Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.

238
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,317
Miss Reynolds bought the ticket

239
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,800
with Mr. Reynolds' money.

240
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,270
But Mr. MacDonald
currently possesses it.

241
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,760
Correct.
But I deserve it, and here's why.

242
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,933
<i>There we were, right?</i>

243
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,613
<i>We were just walking down the street,</i>

244
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:38,898
<i>minding our own business.</i>

245
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,533
<i>I'd just spotted the
perfect pile of dog shit,</i>

246
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:42,553
<i>and naturally I stepped in it.</i>

247
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:43,673
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

248
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:45,320
Okay, I'm a little confused.

249
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,318
Why would you voluntarily
step into the dog feces?

250
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,898
- Well, I didn't, really...
- You just said you did.

251
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,039
- You said naturally you did...
- And we all watched you do it.

252
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:53,390
All right, fine.

253
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,728
I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit

254
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,744
so that I would smell of dog shit.
Happy?

255
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:01,293
- Less happy.
- Why would it make me happy?

256
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:02,906
I was trying to cover up the smell

257
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,586
of the skunk that I let spray me

258
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:06,332
so that there would be no questions.

259
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:07,650
- Well, now I have more questions.
- Of course you do.

260
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:09,461
Like: why did you let a skunk spray you?

261
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,537
- To cover the smell of cologne, man.
- Oh, man. You know what?

262
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,413
Go to the beginning.
Go to the first smell!

263
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,158
The first smell that begat
all the other smells!

264
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,233
The first smell was cigarettes!
I've been smoking with Dee!

265
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,518
All right? Fine, I said it.

266
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,098
Oh. Oh, okay. So, right.

267
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,205
So you thought we would care
about the smell of cigarettes,

268
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,050
- but not the smell of skunk or dog shit.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

269
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,335
Well, it doesn't matter anyway,
all right,

270
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:26,949
because I deserve the ticket.

271
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,432
Because if the shit shoe's a matcher,

272
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:29,814
Charlie gets the scratcher!

273
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,131
- Oh... shit. - What the shit?
- Come on.

274
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:33,042
That shirt reeks!

275
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:34,030
- Is that what that smell was?
- Yeah.

276
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:35,017
I thought it was just him.

277
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,895
It does smell; it smells very bad.

278
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,608
But give me a cigarette;
I'll cover it up.

279
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,484
But, look, if it smells like shit,
you must acquit.

280
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:42,395
You know what? If everyone's
gonna be smoking on my dime...

281
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:44,141
Look, nobody is debating whether or not

282
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:45,557
the shoe print is yours.

283
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:46,776
We all know that it is,

284
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,883
because everybody saw you kick me.

285
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,661
We're debating whether or not
you actually saved my life.

286
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:53,033
Which you did not,
because I was just about to do

287
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,910
- a sweet backflip to safety when you...
- Oh, bullshit.

288
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,424
He's never once flipped!

289
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:57,972
- Here we go.
- I do flips all the time.

290
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,223
- You have never once flipped.
- In the pool?

291
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:00,738
Which you would not have done

292
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,999
had I not warned you,
thereby saving your life!

293
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,514
That is my ticket.

294
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,260
Oh...

295
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,406
Ridiculous. "Backflip."

296
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,510
<i>There I was, minding my own business,</i>

297
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,765
<i>bird watching.</i>

298
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:18,056
Beautiful day, isn't it?

299
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,689
It's really gorgeous and...

300
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:20,965
Are those mirrors?

301
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:23,047
- No.
- You creep.

302
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,502
He wasn't really bird watching,

303
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,023
he was looking up women's skirts.

304
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,015
- He peeps on women.
- That's his move.

305
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:28,040
He's disgusting.

306
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,992
Like I said, bird watching.

307
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:31,679
Not you.

308
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:35,150
Now, the point is that I said,

309
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:36,638
"Look out, faggot,"

310
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,588
which were the words
that saved Mac's life.

311
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:42,227
Thereby, I am entitled to
at least half that ticket.

312
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,575
Well, why did you use the slur

313
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,823
instead of just yelling
your friend's name?

314
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,311
Well, there was a lot going on.

315
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,295
I needed something
that would cut through.

316
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,212
Well, as soon as I said the slur,

317
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:55,652
everybody knew to look at Mac.

318
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,842
Look out, faggot!

319
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:57,999
<i>Mac knew to look.</i>

320
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:01,040
<i>Dennis and Dee knew to look.</i>

321
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,257
<i>Charlie, who kicked him in the chest,</i>

322
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,108
<i>knew to look.</i>

323
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,183
<i>Hell, even the little kid
with the balloon</i>

324
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:09,572
<i>knew where to look.</i>

325
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:13,177
Okay, it may have been effective,

326
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,291
but it was an offensive slur.

327
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:18,014
And a bigot should not be
entitled to a hero's payout.

328
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,843
You're allowed to use
any language you want

329
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,167
to save somebody's life.

330
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:23,986
- Really? Any language?
- Yes.

331
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,970
- You gonna let a man die over a word?
- Yeah, yeah.

332
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,655
I mean, come on. It's just a word.

333
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,938
"Just a word." Oh. Okay.

334
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,491
Well, Frank, tell me something:

335
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,476
If you were going to save
somebody else's life,

336
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:36,087
you know, from a falling piano,
and you needed a word to just...

337
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,006
- to just cut right through...
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:41,246
...what word would you use
to call out to the arbiter?

339
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:46,834
Uh...

340
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,281
I suppose...

341
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,429
Yeah, you know what?
We're, uh, we're treading

342
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:52,787
- on some dangerous territory here, buddy.
- Yeah.

343
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,878
"Nigger"?

344
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,101
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

345
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,928
- What, what?
- Charlie, you can't use that word.

346
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,002
I'm trying to guess
the word that he was saying

347
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,887
- that he thought Frank was gonna say.
- No, you don't say that ever.

348
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,054
- I was not using the word.
- Don't ever... that's not...

349
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,161
You can't use that word, buddy.

350
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:05,814
And yet, we've just sort of been

351
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:07,633
casually throwing the F-word around

352
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,791
willy-nilly for the past few days,

353
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:10,444
and that hasn't been a problem?

354
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:13,486
Well, yeah, Mac, because the...
there's a very dark history

355
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,701
- associated with... the N-word.
- Yeah.

356
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,379
Did you know that a faggot
is a burning bundle of sticks

357
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:20,429
on top of which they
used to burn homosexuals?

358
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,475
So, basically,
when you call someone a "faggot,"

359
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,890
you are saying that they
should be burned at the stake.

360
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,097
Is that right? That's, uh...

361
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,483
- Yes.
- That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark.

362
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,301
- That's pretty dark.
- Yeah, yeah.

363
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,557
Well, maybe there are a few words

364
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,549
- that we shouldn't be throwing around.
- Yep.

365
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:35,606
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

366
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,598
- What about "cunt"?
- Oh!

367
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,557
We can't lose that!

368
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,947
- Yeah, it's a good word.
- What?

369
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:40,203
That's tough. It's a great word.

370
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,261
And it's just not offensive.

371
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,848
Especially, uh, directed towards

372
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,627
a woman when you're trying
to insult her.

373
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,544
When you're trying to
make a woman feel small.

374
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:49,528
That's extremely offensive!

375
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,949
Come on, you could yell "penis" at me,

376
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,734
and I'd be fine with it.
Well, all right, fine.

377
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,289
Well, then, we're gonna
take away your favorite word.

378
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:56,471
- What, "cocksucker"? - Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:57,729
What's wrong with that?

381
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:00,208
You can't say "cocksucker"
if we can't say "cunt."

382
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,399
I find it offensive that the idea

383
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,218
of sucking cocks is offensive.

384
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,729
Exactly. There's nothing
offensive about sucking cock.

385
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:07,351
Half the population loves to suck cock.

386
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:08,706
The other half of the population,

387
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,028
they love getting their cock sucked.

388
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:11,186
It's kind of a win-win.

389
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,342
We're getting off the point, okay?

390
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:16,341
In terms of the ticket,
I'm calling bullshit on Frank,

391
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:18,656
because, for some reason,
he thinks that I'm gay,

392
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,640
and that is why he called me the F-word,

393
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:21,829
which makes him a bigot.

394
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,516
Oh, wait.

395
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,774
Uh, catch me up here.

396
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,394
Now, you're not gay?

397
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:27,650
Obviously not.

398
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,270
Okay. Interesting.

399
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:32,378
So, Mr. Reynolds, um, simply,

400
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,031
was just trying to disrespect you.

401
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,917
He wasn't trying to make a comment

402
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,867
about your sexual orientation?

403
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,115
No, well, see, here's where things
get just a little bit

404
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,951
tricky, because Frank
thinks Mac is gay because...

405
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:45,505
- Mac is gay.
- Yeah.

406
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:47,490
What?! What-what are you talking about?

407
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:49,077
Enough with this.

408
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:50,433
- This is boring.
- I mean, he's into the closet,

409
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:51,457
- he's out of the closet.
- Yeah, yeah.

410
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,548
We don't like you either way.

411
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh, look, now, I care about my body.

412
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,408
So now they become, like,
obsessed with me being gay.

413
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,641
Obsessed? We don't care!
We're the ones who don't care.

414
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:58,797
Okay. All right, hold on.

415
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,550
Dee, let me just...
let me put this to bed.

416
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,535
Okay, Mac, we're in support of it.

417
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,088
So, just come on out of the closet

418
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,114
- and be done with it.
- You'll feel better.

419
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:06,305
- You'll feel better.
- Come on.

420
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,412
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

421
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,049
Mac, Mac...

422
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,704
We found the bike.

423
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,489
Yeah, so?

424
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,205
The bike in the basement?

425
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,082
What about it?

426
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,786
Oh, Mac.

427
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,308
Mac,

428
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:28,664
- don't make me go get the bike.
- Oh.

429
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,581
I've got nothing to hide.

430
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:32,433
Just, uh, go get the bike.

431
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,175
I'm-a go get the bike.

432
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,978
I would like to present
into evidence, uh...

433
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,153
Mac's bike.

434
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,520
What? It's an awesome workout bike.

435
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,505
What's the big deal?

436
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:50,986
Okay.

437
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:53,648
Mac, why don't you go
ahead and operate the bike.

438
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:54,898
Yeah.

439
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,409
Sure.

440
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,975
No problem.
Just-just like any other workout bike.

441
00:14:59,006 --> 00:14:59,960
Well...

442
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,375
You pedal...

443
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,962
Uh, there you go.

444
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:07,949
Outrageous.

445
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:09,034
Yeah, there it is.

446
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,631
I mean, it's just the craziest...

447
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:12,814
All right, all right, all right.

448
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:13,673
Okay, I...

449
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:15,446
I know what you're thinking, okay?

450
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:17,320
But it is not what it looks like.

451
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,962
Yeah, what it looks like

452
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,230
is that you are fucking
yourself with a dildo bike.

453
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:22,217
I mean, you got the bike shorts

454
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:23,466
with the slits in them, in the...

455
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,933
Oh, the-the ones in the back?
That's for air flow.

456
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,083
This is grotesque.

457
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:28,397
No, you're not understanding.

458
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,140
I modded out a regular workout bike,

459
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:31,916
to create the optimal workout.

460
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:34,185
- And added a penis.
- Yeah.

461
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:35,722
Oh... I see.

462
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,852
I see where you guys are
getting off the rails.

463
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:39,903
That's not a penis.

464
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:41,286
Oh.

465
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:42,176
It's a fist.

466
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:44,342
Uh...

467
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,315
I call it the Ass Pounder 4000.

468
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,056
- And it works like this.
- Uh, no...

469
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,490
Imagine you're riding up a steep hill,

470
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:53,218
and you've already been
working super hard,

471
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,060
and you're sweating and you're tired.

472
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,163
What do you do when you're tired?
You want to rest.

473
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,381
You go to sit down,

474
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:00,452
it pushes you right
back up in your workout.

475
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,359
The Ass Pounder 4000
will never let you rest.

476
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,396
- Yeah, see?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.

477
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,613
- That's the way it works.
- We got it.

478
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:08,243
Now, I even have an amazing tagline.

479
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:11,169
"The Ass Pounder: Never stop pumping."

480
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,960
Well, um...

481
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:20,504
think we've seen enough.

482
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:22,050
I've certainly learned something.

483
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,338
This... this has nothing to do
with being gay.

484
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:26,983
This is just the work of a man who's

485
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,330
an extreme sexual deviant.

486
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,808
Gay or not.

487
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,748
- Can I have one of those?
- Yeah, whatever,

488
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,998
- Yeah, whatever, dude.
- Oh, whatever.

489
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,839
You know, you guys are just
jealous because I've got

490
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:37,009
<i>a million-dollar idea
and I've got the ticket.</i>

491
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,818
You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!

492
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,000
I bought the ticket.

493
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,939
What are you talking about?!
Are you crazy?!

494
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,391
Quiet! Quiet!

495
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:46,904
Quiet!

496
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,877
Now, I've heard from everybody involved,

497
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,113
and I will make my decision.

498
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:52,822
But let me make one thing clear.

499
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,570
In order for this to be entirely just,

500
00:16:56,603 --> 00:17:01,337
I will make my decision based
on fairness and compromise.

501
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,455
You understand?

502
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:08,405
Okay, I think I'm all caught up.

503
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,378
- All right, so what's the verdict?
- Yeah, what do you got?

504
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,499
I think it's actually
pretty straightforward.

505
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,473
Mr. MacDonald is in
possession of the ticket,

506
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:16,557
so he has ownership.

507
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,301
However, he would not be

508
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,259
in possession if his life were
not saved by Mr. Reynolds,

509
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:24,152
who set off the chain
of events saving him.

510
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:26,946
So I see it as a 50/50 split.

511
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:28,787
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm a hero!

512
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,970
- Oh! You bitch!
- 50/50 split?

513
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,221
- ...out of the way!
- Nothing for the man

514
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:33,028
- who paid for the ticket?
- I bought it!

515
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,460
And this bigot here is
gonna get a hero's payout?

516
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,156
He may be a bigot and he
did use disgusting speech,

517
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,571
but it's not technically

518
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:42,925
hate speech since Mr. MacDonald
does not claim to be gay.

519
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:44,897
Oh.

520
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,987
Oh, does that mean if I claim to be gay,
I get all of it?

521
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:49,959
Well, um, y-yes.

522
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,997
You would be entitled to keep all of it.

523
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,149
I claim to be gay!

524
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,431
- No!
- No, no, no, no.

525
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,432
Now you're gay?

526
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,928
There's a history behind it.

527
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:57,916
I've been gay forever.

528
00:17:57,947 --> 00:18:00,151
Everybody knows it.
Even the balloon kid knew it.

529
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:02,189
Soon as he gets that ticket,
he's going back in the closet.

530
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,405
- Yeah. This isn't fair.
- Mark my words.

531
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:04,819
If he's gonna do it,
he's got to stay out,

532
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,806
which he won't, I guarantee you.

533
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:07,382
Fine. Whatever. Yeah. I'm out!

534
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,895
Totally out. I'm gonna...

535
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,702
Hey, uh, excuse me,
would you please do the honors

536
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,774
<i>on my ticket, please?</i>

537
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,141
- It's probably worthless.
- Okay. Sure.

538
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,641
Let's, uh...
let's see what we have here.

539
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:18,429
Okay.

540
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:21,650
Wow.

541
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,703
What?

542
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,709
- What is it?
- Well, you're a winner.

543
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:26,746
What? How much?

544
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:28,817
$10,000.

545
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,902
What?!

546
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,106
- No! No!
- Oh, my God!

547
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:33,354
Gay Mac rules!

548
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:35,657
- Bullshit!
- Gay-gay, rich Mac!

549
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,285
All right, if you will just sign this,
releasing the ticket

550
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,212
- and agreeing to my ruling.
- Don't mind if I do.

551
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,875
I wonder what I'm gonna do
with all this money.

552
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,386
Maybe start an LLC.

553
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,031
Ass Pounder 4000?

554
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:49,201
It's all going right into the product.

555
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:51,831
Yeah, yeah, sign the paper so
you can go back in the closet.

556
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:52,949
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

557
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,921
- You go back in. Go ahead.
- Huh?

558
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,893
Well, you signed the thing.
You got your money.

559
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,867
Just go back in the closet.
Just get it over with.

560
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,627
We know you're gonna do it,
so you might as well just do it.

561
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,402
Yeah. Yeah.

562
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,939
I don't know.
Maybe I'll... maybe I'll stay out.

563
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,407
- Really?
- Yeah.

564
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,308
It doesn't matter.

565
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:11,769
You can just go back in.
You signed the paper.

566
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,823
Y-Yeah. I mean, you got your money.

567
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:15,147
No, I think I'm out now.

568
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:19,413
Yeah. I'm... I'm gay.

569
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:22,011
Actually feels pretty good.

570
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:23,522
See ya, guys.

571
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,413
- Wow.
- Finally.

572
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,583
- Eh, good for him, right?
- Yeah, good for him. I'm...

573
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:35,390
- Absolutely.
- Guess I'm happy for him.

574
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,002
Yeah, it's a relief, honestly.

575
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,499
All right, if, uh,
you'll just take care of this,

576
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,276
then, uh, we'll be all done.

577
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,445
- What's this?
- That would be a bill.

578
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,497
- Ooh.
- Oh, money stuff.

579
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:45,976
- Uh...
- That goes to Frank.

580
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,653
I know it's steep,
but you did go through

581
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,237
three arbiters,
and you've been here 17 hours.

582
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:52,748
- Yeah. I'm exhausted.
- Yikes, yikes.

583
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,227
What's-what's it add up to there, Frank?

584
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,727
$9,986.

585
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,896
- Yikes.
- Holy cow, you guys aren't cheap.

586
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,177
You guys aren't cheap.

587
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:02,414
The arbitration was Mac's idea.

588
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,716
- Let's let him pay for it.
- That's a great idea.

589
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:06,456
- That's fair. In fairness' sake.
- Yeah.

590
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,923
- Yeah, he's got the money for it.
- He's got the money now. Yeah.

591
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:11,289
But maybe let's make him
pay it tomorrow, you know?

592
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:13,295
- L-Let's let him have this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:16,879
Poor guy did just come
out over a $14 scratcher.

594
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,128
- That's all that's left?
- Yeah.

595
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:19,936
- Oh, no.
- That sucks.

596
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,987
Oh, no.

597
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,698
Tell you what, man, I am happy for him,

598
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:24,932
- but I do still hate him.
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,399
- It's not a gay or straight thing, is it?
- No, no, no, no, no.

600
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,729
It's a Mac thing.

601
