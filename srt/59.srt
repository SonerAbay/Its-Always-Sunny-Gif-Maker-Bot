1
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,470
Hey.

2
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:13,905
Hi.

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,606
Hey.

4
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:18,309
Come back to bed and snuggle with me.

5
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:22,547
Oh... I wish I could, but
I got to go to work.

6
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:24,348
But there's cab fare
on the nightstand.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,651
That's the third morning
in a row you've done that.

8
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,052
We're married.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,088
I'm already home, silly.

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,122
Right. You're here.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,390
We're married, and that's cool.

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,357
I'm psyched, dude.

13
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,125
That's great.

14
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:35,326
So you're... Yeah, okay.

15
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:38,062
Well, you know, you could use the
cab fare though to get to work.

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,230
Oh, I don't work.

17
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:40,031
Oh, oh, okay.

18
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,933
I just thought maybe you weren't
going to work recently because

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,668
we were going through a little
bit of a honeymoon phase.

20
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,636
But you're saying that
you don't have a job.

21
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:46,404
No job.

22
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,139
No job at all? Wow.

23
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,340
All yours.

24
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,808
All mine.

25
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,076
All mine all the time.

26
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:53,211
All the time.

27
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:54,745
Okay. Except on my work days.

28
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:58,483
I do have to go to work, you know, so...
That's cool, though.

29
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,852
You can just hang out here, I
guess, and sort of get used to

30
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,688
the lay of the land or whatever...
Although, don't-don't go

31
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:04,589
snooping around too much.

32
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:06,424
'Cause this has all happened
really fast and I really

33
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:08,559
haven't had time to do a pass yet.

34
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:10,261
Don't-don't look in those drawers.

35
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:11,562
What's in those drawers?

36
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,331
My sex tapes.

37
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:13,998
Yeah.

38
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,366
All right, I got to go to work.

39
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,702
I love you.

40
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:21,038
I love you, too, Maureen.

41
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,893
Okay, look, dude,
all I'm saying is that you

42
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,896
started off our domestic
partnership on some very shaky,

43
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,497
very bullshitty ground, dude.

44
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:13,001
And I'm saying, Charlie,
you should get over it, move on.

45
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,237
You signed the prenup, case closed.

46
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,239
You told me it was
the phone bill, man.

47
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,307
Of course I signed it.

48
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:22,877
Why would you think that you
needed to sign a phone bill.

49
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:26,548
I can't keep track of our
financial comings and goings.

50
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:30,352
When he hands me something to sign and
it's about money and papers, I sign it.

51
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,853
Hey-oh.

52
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,289
Look who got a brand-new car.

53
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:36,691
I'm still a little bit
confused as to why in the hell

54
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,927
you two got married
in the first place.

55
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:42,464
Charlie, gets health insurance
and I get diddly-squat.

56
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:43,398
He's gonna get some perks.

57
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,366
He doesn't trust me.

58
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,501
Hey, why in the hell are you
bathing yourself in the sink?

59
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,570
Because I don't
have a home anymore.

60
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,305
So this is where I take a shower.

61
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:51,406
This is where I live, Dennis.

62
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,009
Texting me again.

63
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:54,976
This is pathetic.

64
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,244
Back me up on this, Dennis.

65
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:58,747
You got a prenup with Maureen, right?

66
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:00,181
Uh, no, I did not.

67
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:01,082
Should I have?

68
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,618
Should you have?

69
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:04,919
You are screwed.

70
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:06,288
Typical.

71
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,956
This is so typical.

72
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,492
My God, Dee, you clearly have
something you want to say.

73
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,926
So let's just get it over with.

74
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:12,761
Oh, no.

75
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,795
No, it's no big deal.

76
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:16,698
It's just Bill Ponderosa is like
obsessed with me now or something.

77
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,533
I don't know, he's
texting me all the time.

78
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:19,367
He calls me, like, nonstop.

79
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:20,735
He bought me a new car.

80
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:25,040
Dee, are you seriously bragging
about sleeping with a married man?

81
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,442
Yeah, one second you're on your
high horse about how great

82
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,444
marriage is, and now
you're destroying one?

83
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:31,112
Well, I'm not the one who's married.

84
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,913
I didn't do anything wrong.

85
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:33,214
You let him buy you a car.

86
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:35,283
Well, Frank, I'm not going
to go passing on free cars.

87
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,453
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, all
this talk about marriage and

88
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:42,691
Dee being such a whore has got me
thinking... I never got a bachelor party.

89
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:43,725
We should go to the strip club.

90
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,727
Right now?

91
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,195
Yeah, immediately.

92
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:49,497
And since you would have been my
best man, you should probably

93
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:54,769
throw it for me.

94
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:57,339
Yeah, and I'm still pretty pissed about
you not throwing me a bachelor party.

95
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,107
So this way I figure we'll be even.

96
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,342
I'm ready for this.

97
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,744
Being married to Charlie's
got me all confused.

98
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,245
I got to get my hetero on.

99
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:05,947
♪ Want to get dirty, dirty ♪

100
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:08,717
♪ I'm gonna make your body
hot, girl Make you sweat ♪

101
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:09,851

103
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,290
♪ Mm, mm... ♪

104
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:16,358
I like that move.

105
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:17,125
What is that?

106
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:17,792
That's it.

107
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,460
Motorcycle?

108
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:19,928
That's pretty...
Yeah, not like that, though.

109
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,097
It's pretty good, but you got to use...

110
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:22,931
...a little bit more shoulder.

111
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:24,699
I like the way he's
doing it, actually.

112
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,301
Yeah, 'cause I'm like,
I'm bending the bike.

113
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,036
But that's not really
how drive a motorcycle.

114
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:29,871
Yeah, but you're not really
driving a motorcycle.

115
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:30,572
It's my thing, okay?

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,239
All right.

117
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:33,641
Well, if you're not going to take it
seriously, then don't... then don't do it.

118
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,043
I feel like I was
doing it pretty good.

119
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,511
I feel like you're
taking it too seriously.

120
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,312
Let's not fight.

121
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,979
It's a bachelor party.

122
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,180
Oh, I got a text.

123
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:40,882
I got a text from the woman.

124
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,183
"Miss you."

125
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,087
I'll just write, "Miss you, too.
Miss you, too."

126
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:48,523
Now do I write the word "too" or
should I write the number two?

127
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:50,725
What's the best way to do that
when we're texting back and forth?

128
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:51,393
Who cares, dude?

129
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,961
I'll do the word, I'll do the word.

130
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:53,995
Okay, great.

131
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:55,130
Frank, what's with the purse?

132
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,865
It's my money bag.

133
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:58,733
I'm gonna make it rain, baby.

134
00:04:58,801 --> 00:04:59,868
Whoa, hold on.

135
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:00,769
Make it rain?

136
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,504
What is that... you gonna
chuck money everywhere?

137
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,204
Don't do that.

138
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:04,372
Will you lighten up?

139
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,273
I'd like to make it rain.

140
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,374
Can I make it rain, Mac?

141
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:07,342
Why are you asking me?

142
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,744
Well, dude, 'cause I can't
fund my own bachelor party.

143
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:11,012
That's just tacky.

144
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,947
Fine.

145
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,749
Excuse me. Hi.

146
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:15,683
Hi.

147
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:18,620
What is the recommended amount of
money for one to make it rain?

148
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:19,788
I'd say at least a thousand.

149
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:24,526
How much would it cost for this gentleman
and I to get a nice couple's dance?

150
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,828
Sorry. You have to be
a couple for that.

151
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,062
We are a couple.

152
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,564
Charlie, documents.

153
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,399
All right, this is
what it was all for.

154
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,700
Mm-hmm.

155
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:34,469
Look at this... we're married.

156
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,805
Oh, you guys are cute.

157
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:39,174
You're still going to
have to pay full price.

158
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,108
Screw this.

159
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:41,443
I'm gonna go make it rain.

160
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,011
All right, well, hang on a second.

161
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:43,978
Give me some money.

162
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:45,880
Let's go, I'm your husband.

163
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,882
Give me some money.

164
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,418
♪ Ooh, don't say maybe... ♪

165
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:51,586
There it is.

166
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:52,520
What is this?

167
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:54,756
I'm tightening the purse
strings on this relationship

168
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,925
until there's a little
bit of give and take.

169
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:58,259
You know what, keep your money.

170
00:05:58,327 --> 00:05:59,861
I don't need your little allowance.

171
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:00,795
Hey, we'll see.

172
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,665
"Miss you more."

173
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:05,767
That's classic Maureen right there.

174
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:13,942
She's always got to one-up
me "Miss you most."

175
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,744
Most... can't get more
than most, right?

176
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,947
So that should...
that should be the end of it, right?

177
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:20,949
So, I hope so.

178
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,055
Oh, man.

179
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:28,590
You just cannot get enough, huh?

180
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:31,159
Sorry for just showing
up, you know, but you weren't

181
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:32,260
responding to my texts.

182
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:33,595
Oh, I totally get it.

183
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:35,964
Once you pop, you can't
stop, am I right?

184
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:39,234
Actually, I came clean to my wife.

185
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,935
And she kicked me out of the house.

186
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:42,136
Ew. Ouch.

187
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:42,871
Yeah.

188
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:44,806
Bet you wish you could
take that one back.

189
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:46,975
So I was thinking, maybe I
could stay here tonight.

190
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:47,809
Oh.

191
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,744
You are somewhat responsible for this.

192
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,613
No. No, no, no, no.

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,448
Can't you stay in a hotel or something.
Isn't that...?

194
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:56,117
I would, but she froze my assets.

195
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,385
Yikes.

196
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,787
Shit's getting pretty
real for you, huh?

197
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:04,325
But nonetheless, uh, I really, like I
said, I don't want you in my space.

198
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:06,861
So there's got to be a lot of
other places that you could stay

199
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,930
that aren't, you know, here.

200
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:10,732
Dee, I gave you a car.

201
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,568
You're gonna jam the
car in my face, huh?

202
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:16,104
Come in.

203
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,308
Thanks.

Dennis!

209
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:46,901
Hey... Hey...
What are you doing?

210
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:48,736
It is 2:00 in the morning.

211
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:50,371
I was sleeping, Dennis.

212
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,172
That's cool.

213
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,841
Well, you're up now, baby
girl, so let's do some shots.

214
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,943
No, I don't drink.

215
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,944
You know that.

216
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,879
I think it makes people look ugly.

217
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:01,149
I...
Maybe I should go to my room.

218
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,650
That is not your room anymore.

219
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:05,620
It is my craft studio, so
kindly stay out of there.

220
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:06,287
What?!

221
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:07,689
Don't freak out, dude.

222
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:08,590
It's all good, dude.

223
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:11,059
She turned it into her craft
studio where she makes terrible

224
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:13,995
sweatshirts out of cats or...
puts cats in sweatshirts, and then...

225
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:16,197
I'm, like, "Dude, what
the hell did you do?"

226
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,399
Dennis, do not talk to me that way.

227
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,167
I am your wife.

228
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,336
Please show me some respect
in front of your friends.

229
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,503
Uh, you know what?

230
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:29,744
I'm not entirely certain
that Maureen Ponderosa.

231
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:32,280
That doesn't even...
I don't know what that... What?

232
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:32,947
Divorce!

233
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,616
What? What did you just say?

234
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:36,884
I will divorce you, Maureen.

235
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:37,619
I'll do it.

236
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:38,553
Okay, you're drunk.

237
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,121
Why don't we just go to bed...?

238
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:41,222
I'm not drunk.

239
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,726
I'm more sober than I've
ever been in my entire life.

240
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,795
Okay, I'm a little bit drink.

241
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,864
I'm totally drunk, but
my mind is sober.

242
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,101
And my mind's telling me the
following: I don't love you, Maureen.

243
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,235
I don't love you.

244
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,536
I never loved you.

245
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,605
You're annoying and you're strange.

246
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:59,374
I don't know what to say.

247
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:02,477
Don't say anything 'cause every time
you open your mouth, I'm, like, "Ugh!"

248
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,845
It's like her breath...
Ugh!

249
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:06,180
It's like always so bad.

250
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:07,415
It's like a dead tooth.

251
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,182
It's the dead tooth.

252
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,517
I'm saying it now. I'll say it.

253
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:10,485
You have a dead tooth.

254
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,319
You realize that, right?

255
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:14,088
And I hate it, and it's annoying!

256
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:19,193
I want you and your boy toy
out of my apartment now!

257
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:21,596
I'm the boy toy!

258
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:23,231
You're my boy toy.

259
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:27,268
You know, I'm not gonna
leave our apartment.

260
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:28,970
Or should I say "my apartment,"

261
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:29,837
'cause it's my apartment.

262
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:30,872
Oh, yeah?

263
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:35,343
How about if you guys don't leave, I call
the cops and I tell 'em you beat me?

264
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:37,178
What in the hell are
you talking about?

265
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:41,783
I didn't touch you.

266
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,117
What...? What are you doing?

267
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:43,885
What is that?

268
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,286
I recognize that. What is that?

269
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,655
<i>Oh, shit, that's from...
that's from Fear, dude.</i>

270
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:48,556
Oh, that's Marky Mark.

271
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:49,490
That's Marky Mark.

272
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:50,692
That's what Marky Mark does.

273
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,494
He does that, and then, um...
Oh, shit, and then the cops

274
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,096
come, and then he...
Oh, and the police think that

275
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,131
<i>William Petersen, the guy from CSI...
Go. She means business.</i>

276
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:57,799
<i>She means business.</i>

277
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,801
<i>Shit! Oh, shit! Ah!</i>

278
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:08,781
Oh, my God!

279
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,918
You are really making
yourself at home here, huh?

280
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:14,654
Sorry. Want to have sex?

281
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:16,355
What?! No, no!

282
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:17,190
God, no!

283
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:18,324
Please close your legs up.

284
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,794
That's... Listen, I don't want
to get into your personal life,

285
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:22,929
you know what I mean?

286
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:27,266
It's not really any of my business, but
this is really bumming me out, okay?

287
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,935
So here's what I'd like to do.

288
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:31,337
I'd like to talk game
plan with you, okay?

289
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:34,941
And, um, number one, and most
importantly, uh, the car.

290
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:35,808
Now hear me out.

291
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,811
It was kinda a gift, so it'd be
pretty rude of you to try and...

292
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,780
I don't give a shit
about the car, okay?

293
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,447
Mm-hmm.

294
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,715
My life is in ruins.

295
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:43,382
Mm-hmm.

296
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,450
I'm gonna lose my kids.

297
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,018
Okay, great, so we're in agreement.

298
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:46,919
I keep the car.

299
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:47,587
That's wonderful.

300
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:53,326
Now secondly, this is gonna be kind
of hard to hear, but, um... get out!

301
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,661
Get out!

302
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,663
You gotta go back to your wife, okay?

303
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:58,931
And get out of my place.

304
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,768
Okay, well, then I'm gonna need
the car to get over there.

305
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,770
Okay, well, the car's
off the table, okay?

306
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,139
We just discussed the car, and
we came to an agreement that...

307
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,473
Stop bringing up the car, okay?

308
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,343
So I'll get dressed and I'll drive you
over there, and I'll drop you off.

309
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,010
Okay.

310
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:12,044
Okay. Well, get up.

311
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:14,647
No, oh, God, I don't, I don't...
Okay, I'm gonna go in here.

312
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,314
Jesus.

313
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,050
Yeah, you now, I mean, I
wouldn't have imagined the whole

314
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,452
thing going down quite the way it did.

315
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,821
It was a little uncomfortable,
but I'm glad, you know, we got

316
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,158
our little heart-to-heart, or whatever
you want to call it, out of the way.

317
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:28,227
I feel like now we can set aside
our differences and settle this

318
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:29,595
whole divorce pretty
amicably, you know?

319
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,397
You think it's gonna
be that easy, dude?

320
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:32,932
Well, yeah, of course.

321
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,935
I mean, marriage and divorce
these days, it's like a, it's

322
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,137
more of a formality than
anything else, you know?

323
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,506
It's just sort of something
that you do, right?

324
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,308
Don't start with me, Charlie!

325
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:43,576
You bring nothing to the table!

326
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:44,243
Nothing!

327
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,179
Oh!
I bring nothing to the table!

328
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,213
This is my money!

329
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,581
You bring nothing!

330
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,720
Frank, okay?

331
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,256
"How did my laundry get so clean?

332
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:59,292
Oh, oh, who washed all
the dishes today?"

333
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,626
Nobody washes the dishes!

334
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:03,462
We eat the food directly off the
coffee table, and you know it!

335
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,031
I cannot stand being married to you!

336
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,365
Oh, you can't stand it?

337
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm gonna pull the plug.

338
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,968
You gonna flush our
marriage down the toilet?!

339
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:09,902
Right down the toilet!

340
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,870
Flush it, big boy!

341
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,871
Yes, there he goes!

342
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,773
Flush it down the toilet
'cause I don't care!

343
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:14,440
Oh, yeah?

344
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:17,043
I'm gonna pull the plug, but first
I'm gonna draw up some documents.

345
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,011
All right, this is gonna
be an ugly-ass divorce,

346
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,346
and we're gonna get a mediator.

347
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,447
Okay, I got it.

348
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,850
We'll get that idiot lawyer
that always helps us out.

349
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:24,884
He does good by us.

350
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,751
Yeah, he's excellent.

351
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,621
But he slapped a restraining order
on us, so we can't use him.

352
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:31,023
Also you need a lawyer, too,
so we should talk about it.

353
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:31,824
I need a lawyer?

354
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:32,491
For what?

355
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,493
How are you not grasping
this situation?

356
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,229
Oh, for the divorce.

357
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:36,963
The divorce, yeah.

358
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,331
You're getting a divorce?

359
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:38,998
Yeah.

360
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,533
All right, sot's going around.

361
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,336
Okay, I think I know someone
who'll take both our cases.

362
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,938
Is it you?

363
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,941
Is it?

364
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,543
'Cause if it's you,
I'm not interested.

365
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:52,778
All right, well, I have a
family member who's a lawyer.

366
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,780
I bet he'd do it.

367
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,084
It's coming up here.

368
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,853
This...
yeah, this is it right here.

369
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,955
The Ponderosas' ponderosa.

370
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,290
Ugh!

371
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:05,892
Could you wait a minute?

372
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,894
I just want to make sure it's okay.

373
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:12,198
Yeah, you know, whatever it's gonna
take to wrap this up, really.

374
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,299
Whew!

375
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,437
Ugh!

376
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:24,944
Maureen?

377
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:25,945
No, it's Dee.

378
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,513
How are things going on your end?

379
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:28,314
Oh, not bad.

380
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:28,981
Yeah, not bad.

381
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:29,649
I'm getting a divorce.

382
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,984
Yeah, I know how that goes.

383
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,787
I got a messy situation
going on on my end, too.

384
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,722
Had to let my guy go.

385
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,157
Had to cut him loose.

386
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,326
I tell you what, though,
I do love the car.

387
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:43,930
Hands-free Blue...
I can do all kinds of stuff with both hands.

388
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,233
Dennis? Did we get cut off?

389
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,401
Okay, hop in there.

390
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,036
No! Wha-wha-wha-wha-what
is this?!

391
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,170
What are you doing?

392
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:52,204
Here he comes!

393
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:53,306
Okay, go, go! Go, go!

394
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,774
What?! Oh, my God!

395
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:01,852
I'm so glad you called, Charlie.

396
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,087
Your uncle never hears
from you anymore.

397
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,690
Well, you're kind of the only
actual lawyer I know, you know,

398
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,758
that doesn't have a
restraining order against me.

399
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:11,628
So I sort of had to call you, so...
I miss you too, bud.

400
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:14,397
Uh... with the touching, with
the touching... none of that.

401
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:15,699
You're put off by my hands.

402
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,534
I know they're very small.

403
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:18,702
It's been very hard on me.

404
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,470
It is not... there's nothing
wrong with your hands, okay?

405
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:21,938
Can we just focus on the law?

406
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,106
Of course.

407
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:26,109
All right, as far as shared
assets, I'm not seeing much.

408
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,244
I'm keeping the hot plate.

409
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:28,478
Over my dead body.

410
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,147
Hey, hey, hey, easy, boys.

411
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:32,816
Don't let the dog off the leash, okay?

412
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:36,386
Remember, the bigger
man walks away first.

413
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,155
You can have the hot plate.

414
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:39,923
Hot dog!

415
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,858
Now we're cooking with gas.

416
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,226
Moving along to art holdings.

417
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:46,096
All I'm seeing is a series
of drawings of elephants.

418
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:47,964
Hmm...
Oh, yeah.

419
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,433
Well, Charlie did the
elephant drawings.

420
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,068
Yeah, but...
You should keep 'em.

421
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:53,803
I did those for you, man.

422
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:54,905
I like 'em.

423
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:56,173
Well, you should like 'em.

424
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,574
I put a lot of work into 'em.

425
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,876
And thank you for saying you like 'em.

426
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,112
I've seen 'em and I like 'em, too.

427
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,079
Yeah, they're good.

428
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:04,347
I'll keep the drawings, okay?

429
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:08,451
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
there's a lot of love in this room here.

430
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,820
Look, Jack, we just want to
get back to where we were.

431
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,191
That's... Sounds like what you
guys want is an annulment.

432
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:17,394
It would essentially
void your partnership.

433
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,229
Yeah, right, that sounds perfect.

434
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:20,263
Marriage blows.

435
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,932
Preaching to the choir, fellas.

436
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:26,503
All right, I just need both
your signatures on here.

437
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,538
All right, that's easy enough.

438
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,840
Easy-peasy.

439
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:33,376
One... two.

440
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:34,377
We did it.

441
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:35,312
That's it.

442
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,781
Your union has hereby been dissolved.

443
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:40,984
Why did we have to do all the touching
and the hand-holding if it was just...?

444
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:41,785
It was fun.

445
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:42,752
Hey, Mac.

446
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,055
Do you mind snapping a
photo for the Web site?

447
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:46,823
But keep my hands out of the shot.

448
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,496
I just kidnapped Bill
Ponderosa's kids.

449
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:56,132
All right, are the kids
confined in any way, maybe in a

450
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,270
crawl space or a backyard bunker?

451
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,838
No, they're out in the car.

452
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,173
Have you touched them yet?

453
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,274
Absolutely not.

454
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:05,308
What...? Who is this man?

455
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:09,512
No, you don't need to...
What is she, some cheap tramp... huh?

456
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,447
Oh, no.

457
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:13,116
Bill, oh, my God, you
are such an asshole.

458
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,351
I followed you, okay?

459
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,453
Angel, I...
I knew you were seeing someone else.

460
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,722
Honey, that... Hi.
Hi, there, I'm Dee.

461
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,190
Uh, I understand that.

462
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:24,227
Listen, I wanted to say I'm
really sorry about the kids.

463
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:26,730
I tell you what, I did
not mean to kidnap them.

464
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,932
That was all...
that was all this guy.

465
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,433
Yeah, they're not my kids.

466
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:31,835
Aren't you his wife?

467
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:32,969
No.

468
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,170
I'm his mistress.

469
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,305
Well, what the hell, man?

470
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:36,373
I'm taking my car back.

471
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,407
Nuh-uh. That's my car.

472
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:39,509
Actually, I loaned it to both of you ladies...

473
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:40,910
Son of a bitch!

474
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:42,045
I gonna kill you!

475
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,781
What? How many
mistresses do you have?

476
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,116
Mistress? I'm his wife.

477
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,384
Kids, let's go.

478
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:49,119
Yeah, come on, kids, let's go home.

479
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,353
No, no, no, no, no.

480
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,621
Not you, Bill.

481
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,791
Now I want this to be
over with right now.

482
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,026
So how much does he owe you?

483
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:57,160
What?

484
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,728
How much does he owe you, whore?

485
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,563
How much does he owe you for the sex?

486
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:01,865
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

487
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,199
I'm not a prostitute.

488
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,268
I think that's... that's clear.

489
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,937
Oh, well, congratulations.

490
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:11,107
You're the only woman he didn't
have to pay to sleep with.

491
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:13,843
You must be very proud of yourself.

492
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:15,645
Wait, no, no.

493
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:17,147
Oh, goddamn it.

494
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:22,419
Yeah, well.

495
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:28,591
The, uh, the gravity of my situation
just set in, so... Let's go get you a

496
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:29,259
divorce, huh?

497
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,193
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,796
Yeah.

499
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:35,098
You guys have any questions?

500
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,466
Yeah, I got a question.

501
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,034
What's in the fanny pack?

502
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:42,605
Oh, check this out, Mac and Dennis.

503
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,274
Just a little victory dance.

504
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:47,077
Thought maybe we could hang out later.

505
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,045
No.

506
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,081
No.

507
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,983
Oh, Mr. Reynolds.

508
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,886
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, what
are you doing here?

509
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:59,589
Well, when I heard you were
getting divorced, I-I felt

510
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:01,991
compelled to involve myself.

511
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:08,531
I'm sorry, how would you have
heard that I was getting a

512
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,202
listening to you drunkenly
explain all that at 3:00 a.m.

513
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:15,338
I enjoyed it so much, that I
tracked down Maureen here and I

514
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:18,908
offered her my services...
pro bono, of course.

515
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,910
Hold on, fellas.

516
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,278
I'm Jack Kelly.

517
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,513
I'm a lawyer.

518
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,181
Hello, Jack Kelly.

519
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:26,816
The pleasure is all mine.

520
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:28,852
It's a pleasure to meet you.

521
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,722
The pleasure's... still...
Why don't we just get started.

522
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,725
Why don't we just get started.

523
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:45,502
Aw...
Boy, the old place, huh?

524
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,638
Some good memories here.

525
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:50,707
All of us.

526
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,709
Oh, yeah.

527
00:18:55,446 --> 00:19:00,216
Hey, um... So I was like...
I'm gonna go, I think...

528
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:01,551
No, no, no, stick around, dude.

529
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:02,218
Stick around.

530
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:02,886
Please don't go.

531
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,454
I don't...
I don't want to, though.

532
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,456
No, you should stay...
I use shea butter.

533
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:08,558
Assorted lanolin products.

534
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,727
Oh, I'm serious, you
could be a hand model.

535
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,462
You've got the goods.

536
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,763
That was quick, guys.

537
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,532
Open and shut case, Dennis.

538
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,232
Okay.

539
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,667
Did you get the apartment back?

540
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:18,368
I sure did.

541
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,438
You did?

542
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,573
And you also acquired Ms.

543
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,108
Ponderosa's debt.

544
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:26,042
Whoo-hoo.

545
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,876
What? You're in debt?

546
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:27,911
Not anymore.

547
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:29,612
But you are... about 90K.

548
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,815
This guy seems to think you
don't have a case and I'm

549
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:33,116
inclined to agree with him.

550
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,486
Yeah. Well, when I found out that Ms.
Ponderosa here had been

551
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:40,290
cast out of her marital home, I
only thought it was fair that

552
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,593
you assumed her debt in addition to
the alimony payments, of course.

553
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,695
Wait a second... so I got
to pay alimony payments?

554
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,330
Uncle Jack, what the hell?!

555
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:48,598
I froze up.

556
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,699
He's great.

557
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,302
<i>Oh, congratulations,
Miss Ponderosa.</i>

558
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,505
<i>Congratulations to you!</i>

559
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:57,273
<i>See you around, Dennis.</i>

560
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:58,041
<i>Yeah.</i>

561
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,108
<i>Mac.</i>

562
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:02,345
<i>Hey, Mac, would you mind taking
a shot of the three of us</i>

563
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,714
<i>for the Web site.</i>

564
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,182
<i>Come on, Dennis.</i>

565
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,018
<i>And would it be okay if you put
your hands on top of mine?</i>

566
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:10,353
<i>Like they're my hands?</i>

567
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:11,221
<i>Sure, yeah.</i>

568
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:11,888
<i>Like that?</i>

569
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:12,622
<i>Yes.</i>

570
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,389
<i>Okay.</i>

571
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:14,557
<i>That looks like my hands.</i>

572
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,026
<i>For the Web site.</i>

573
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:19,362
<i>We're lawyers.</i>
