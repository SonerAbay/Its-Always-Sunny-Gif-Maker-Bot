1
00:00:01,431 --> 00:00:03,231
<i> Charlie,</i>
<i>can I come in already?</i>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,666
<i>Well, that depends, Frank.</i>

3
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:06,367
<i>- Are you done farting?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,536
Well, then you're gonna keep
hanging your ass out the window

5
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:09,320
till you're done, all right?

6
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:11,306
Look, I-I warned you.

7
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:12,740
You want to put slices of rum
ham on a Grilled Charlie?

8
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:13,708
That's a stomach "bomba."

9
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:14,809
It's too much for your system.

10
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:16,411
Then make me another one.

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,213
If I'm gonna stick my ass out
the window, I'm gonna eat.

12
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:20,228
Unbelievable. Alright, here we go.

13
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:21,947
I feel like it's gonna be a week

14
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,165
before your system
gets back to normal.

15
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,250
Y-You can't just eat

16
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:25,518
whatever you...
Charlie...

17
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:28,787
Holy shit!

18
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,437
Are you okay?!

19
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,726
Frank?!

20
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:34,894
Hey, are you all right?

21
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:38,464
Hey! Are you okay?

22
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:41,567
Are you all right, man?

23
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:43,502
Frank!

24
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,004
Where are you going?!

25
00:00:55,304 --> 00:01:05,471

to contaminate the steaks.

28
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,520
I was the first one
to say that, right?

29
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,072
I-I don't think so, no.

30
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,107
I don't think so.
You t... Are you serious?

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,942
No, I remember being on the phone and...
Yeah, being totally serious.

32
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,495
Dennis, Deandra!

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,946
Yeah.
What?

34
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,248
No, I-I... I-I feel
like I came up with it.

35
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,582
It's me!

36
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:25,650
What, do you want
a goddamn medal?

37
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,185
Yeah, get out of here, Frank.

38
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,620
We're right in the middle
of something very important.

39
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,255
I was on the phone;
I came up with it.

40
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,439
What are you talking about?
That never happened...

41
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,258
Your mother's dead.

42
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,893
I thought I was the one that...
Yeah, we know she's dead.

43
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,081
I think I was the one
that told you to make that call.

44
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,529
I-I was just kidding.

45
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,691
Uh, your mother's
not really dead.

46
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,709
Uh, I dropped that bomb
to soften the blow.

47
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,738
We're getting divorced.

48
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:47,972
Wh-What's happening?

49
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,806
Are you doing a bit, Frank?

50
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,807
It's not funny.

51
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,193
Hey! Hey!

52
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,279
Oh, shit, man, are you okay?

53
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,380
And who might you be?

54
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,614
Wh-What?!

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,049
Uh-oh,
he's finally lost it.

56
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,222
Should we toss him in a home?

57
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,018
Yep.
I-I'll get the car.

58
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,085
N-N-No, guys, guys.

59
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,520
Frank fell out my window.

60
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,289
We had our, like,
fire escape taken off,

61
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,324
and, dude, you, like, must
have hit your head real hard.

62
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,127
Look, you seem
like a really nice kid.

63
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,529
But my head is fine.

64
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,914
Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.

65
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,215
Oh, my God.

66
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,134
Oh, it's his skull!

67
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,302
Uh, okay, Frank.

68
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,337
Um, what day is it?
Wednesday.

69
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,972
Yes.
Wrong, it's Tuesday.

70
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,941
Is it? Actually, no,
it's-it's Wednesday.

71
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,676
He's right. I...
Did I lose a day?

72
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,577
Yeah. Okay, you know what?
I got one.

73
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,930
Um, what is the capital of Pennsylvania?
Philadelphia.

74
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,548
Yes. No. I don't
think that's right.

75
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,983
Uh, is it Pittsburgh?

76
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,718
Uh, at one point, it was Philly.

77
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,286
I'm pretty sure. I don't
think they change it.

78
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,956
All right, let's just,
let's ask something easier.

79
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,625
Who's the president
of the United States?

80
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,758
George Bush.

81
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,778
Nah, I was just kidding.

82
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,130
The real president of the United
States is Dick Cheney.

83
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,865
He's pulling all the strings.

84
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,735
Ah, shit, Frank, what year
do you think it is?

85
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,502
2006.

86
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,274
Oh, man. Whoa. Well, okay, so
something clearly happened to Frank

87
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,042
when he fell out of that window.

88
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,944
I think what happened is
he went through the window,

89
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,315
and the window seemed to be some
sort of portal to the year 2006.

90
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,416
He has a concussion.

91
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,884
It's not 2006.

92
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,120
It's crazy, but stranger
things have happened.

93
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,621
- No, they haven't. No, they haven't.
A-A-All right.

94
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,357
Guys, guys, guys.

95
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,125
You remember ten years ago
when Frank first came back,

96
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,860
and he wanted to, like, give
all his money away to charity

97
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,395
and reconnect
with his kids and shit?

98
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,863
Right, then he started hanging
out with Mac and Charlie,

99
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,031
got a taste of the bar lifestyle

100
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,661
and decided he'd rather
live in squalor.

101
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:25,486
Guys, we have an opportunity
to change history.

102
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,922
Are you talking about taking all
his money and kicking him out?

103
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,058
Of course that's what I'm talking about.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to do that.

104
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,442
I-I want to do that. I'm in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,510
We got to come up
with a plan here.

106
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,911
What if Charlie and I take Frank

107
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,214
to the strip club like before,

108
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,915
so he keeps thinking it's 2006?

109
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,717
We can't repeat the same
mistakes of the past.

110
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,985
'Cause that might
trigger his memories.

111
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,253
In fact, keep Charlie
away from Frank.

112
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,322
I mean, he's drawn to him

113
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,288
for some inexplicable reason.

114
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,723
Dee, here's what we'll do.

115
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,208
You and I will
actually reconnect

116
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,027
with Frank this time
instead of rejecting him.

117
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,578
Okay, we just got to figure out
a way to get him

118
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,529
to write us
a check for that money.

119
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,719
You know what we could do is

120
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,865
we could do like
a Wyclef Jean thing

121
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,299
and create a charity for Haiti

122
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,934
and then allegedly keep
all the money for ourselves.

123
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,786
By the time he figures out
what the hell's going on...

124
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,522
♪ We'll be gone till November,
we'll be gone till November ♪

125
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,574
♪ And tell my
baby I'll be gone till November ♪

126
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,111
♪ February, March, April, May ♪

127
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,414
♪ June, July, August,
September... ♪

128
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,282
You don't know the song.
You don't know the song.

129
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,717
There was a good bounce to it.

130
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,519
All right, well, either
way, let's do that.

131
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,291
Guigino's.

132
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,225
Mm-hmm.

133
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,560
That's a nice place.

134
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,594
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,396
Fresh fish daily.

136
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,801
How do you not have fish?

137
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,602
Two can play at that game.

138
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,970
Banging your sister
is perverted.

139
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,441
We ever been here before?

140
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,442
No.

141
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,743
No, no...

142
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:39,710
So, so, so...

143
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,079
Catch me up.

144
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,180
How's life?

145
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,581
Uh, life's good, man.

146
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,982
Things have been,
uh, pretty good.

147
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,017
I'm still working towards
becoming a veterinarian.

148
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:46,968
Of course.
Mm-hmm.

149
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,319
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,587
And I'm still working
toward my dreams

151
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,355
of becoming a Broadway star.

152
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,492
Getting close but just haven't
quite found my traction.

153
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,801
- Right.
- Mmm, that's okay.

154
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:57,061
- You got time.
- Yeah.

155
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,463
Youse are young.

156
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,298
You're what, 25, 26?

157
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah.

158
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,235
Eh, give it a few more years.

159
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,838
If it doesn't work out, you move on.
 Mm-hmm.

160
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,407
I mean, y-you don't want to be
almost 40 working at a bar.

161
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,541
Right.
Nope.

162
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,809
No way.

163
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,744
I know that I've
been a lousy dad,

164
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,598
but there's only one
person to blame for that:

165
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,215
your whore mother.

166
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,566
Mmm. I don't like who
she turned me into.

167
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,786
The big house, the big car.

168
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,088
I'm giving it all away.

169
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,556
To charity.

170
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,393
Well, that is a great idea.

171
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:31,287
I thought you'd give me
a lot of shit for that.

172
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,030
Oh, no. Man, who do
you think we are?

173
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,533
Oh, my gosh. No, we are super
into helping people in need

174
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,018
and poor people and...
Yeah. Y-Y-Yeah, y-yeah.

175
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,237
Dennis and I, we
work very closely

176
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,438
with a charity that,
uh, that offers relief

177
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,806
for the Haiti disaster.

178
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,591
There was a disaster in Haiti?

179
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,409
Oh, oh, had
that not, had that had not...

180
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,261
to d... was it...?

181
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,530
Yeah, I-I just got to look a
quick thing up on my phone if...

182
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,715
Um, s... Dad, uh...

183
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,716
Whoa, wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa.

184
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,750
What's that?

185
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,252
What is that?
My phone?

186
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,653
That's a phone?!

187
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,421
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

188
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,925
That's because...
I invented it.

189
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,926
You invented that?

190
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:02,927
Yep.

191
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,028
That is genius.

192
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,813
Yeah, isn't it?

193
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,082
Dennis, I always thought you'd
be the one to move out in front.

194
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,467
No, it was her,
but it was her after me,

195
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,369
because, um, she actually
came up with that

196
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,437
after I had already
invented this.

197
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,756
You invented that?

198
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,708
Yeah, I invented this first,
and then she copied me.

199
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,010
Well, you know what
I did? I upgraded it.

200
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,378
I made it better.
Oh.

201
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,879
And I was worried
that you were gonna

202
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,766
spend the rest of your
lives in that crap bar.

203
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,568
No, we're killing it.

204
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,619
Well, here's to your futures.

205
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,388
Hey, all right.

206
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,008
Oh, Dee, you bitch.

207
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,665
This is great, Charlie.

208
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,851
I am going to show you what life
could be like without Frank.

209
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,587
Yeah, except the first time
we came here with Frank,

210
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,306
we brought home two
strippers, so...

211
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,490
Yeah, but he banged
both of them.

212
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,975
Uh, true, yeah.

213
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,143
This time,
you and I are gonna be

214
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,578
the ones that bang
the strippers.

215
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,286
Right. Well, why do
you want to bang them?

216
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,914
Oh.

217
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,849
'Cause it's 2006, and
you're still into women.

218
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,817
Crazy.

219
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,286
Huh?
You're not...

220
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,455
You haven't become... Just drop
it, just drop it, just drop it.

221
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,857
Yeah, I-I'll drop it.
Hey!

222
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,759
Frankie, what's up, man? Wait, wait,
wait, wait. What are you doing here?

223
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,228
I thought you were out
with your kids.

224
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,779
You mind if I sit down?
Yeah, absolutely not.

225
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,097
Pop a squat, Frankie.

226
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,098
Goddamn it, I-I...

227
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,900
Oh, my God.

228
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,368
You poor baby.

229
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,636
What happened to your head?

230
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,054
Ooh.

231
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,405
Eh, it's nothing--
just a little scratch.

232
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,807
No, it looks infected.

233
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,208
It does?

234
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,010
Maybe give you a lap dance?

235
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,383
Whoa.

236
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,919
Make yourself at home--
welcome to<i> mi casa.</i>

237
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,488
You got any booze? Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah-- in the bed, under the pillow.

238
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,422
Oh, oh.
Oh, gosh.

239
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,424
I love it, it's so spacious.

240
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,026
It's one goddamn room.

241
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,995
You have a steak knife
in your bed.

242
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,663
Oh, well, that's Frank's, uh...

243
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,399
Um, that is my toe knife.

244
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,533
It's your what?

245
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,302
Uh, that's my
t-toe knife.

246
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,005
For, you know, digging
the scum out of my toes...

247
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,274
It's disgusting, disgusting.
and cutting my nails off.

248
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,242
Y-You cut your toenails
with a knife?

249
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,610
Yeah. Well, yeah.
He does.

250
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:00,478
I mean, it's, uh...
Gross.

251
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,729
a cleaner cut, really.

252
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,616
...scum out of my toenail.

253
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,218
Oh, botched toe.

254
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:08,552
That is disgusting.

255
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,788
<i>Toe knife.</i>

256
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,740
Maybe I ought to try that.

257
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,909
I don't think you should;
can I talk to you outside

258
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,560
for a second? Just one second. Thank you.
All right, all right.

259
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,829
Man. Dude, we have to stop
what's going on in there.

260
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,601
Why? We're about to bang
a couple strippers.

261
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,916
Don't you see?
We're making the same mistakes

262
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,134
that we made
with Frank years ago.

263
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,535
Don't you understand?

264
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,437
He is on a bang path
straight to the waitress.

265
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,739
Oh, shit. All right,
definitely want to avoid that.

266
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,848
All right, let's pull him.

267
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,126
Okay, yeah.
Let's pull him out.

268
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,145
He locked us out.

269
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,446
He did?!
Yes.

270
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,764
So it is 2006.

271
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,117
♪ I'll be gone till November ♪

272
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:43,585
♪ I'll be gone till November ♪

273
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,863
♪ Yo, tell my girl
I'll be gone till November ♪

274
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,917
You know what,
say what you want about Wyclef,

275
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,835
he may have stolen money
from his own people,

276
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:51,687
but that man can write a goddamn song.
Oh, nice.

277
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,022
Right?
He's an excellent songwriter.

278
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,074
And that is an excellent song.

279
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:56,627
Mm-hmm.
But, Dee, Dee, look.

280
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,178
I want to talk to you
about something, okay?

281
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:00,164
We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here.
Yes.

282
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,066
We have a real second chance.
I know.

283
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:03,918
S-So I want to talk to you about our future.
Yes.

284
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,686
Should we get into it?
Yes.

285
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:06,704
All right, here, sit down for a second.
Okay.

286
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,322
'Cause in order to do that,

287
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:09,707
I think we're gonna have to get real.
Okay.

288
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,942
And I want to get very
real with you right now.

289
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,744
- Yeah, go ahead. - Can I do that?
Because I feel like I'm almost coddling you.

290
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,946
Interesting.
But that's neither here nor there.

291
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,048
I just want to get real with you f-for a second, okay?
Yeah, go ahead.

292
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:19,116
So the acting thing.

293
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,317
Mm-hmm.
It's done.

294
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,419
But it's been done
for a long time.

295
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:24,221
I mean, you were
too old in 2006.

296
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,789
You're way too old now.

297
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,092
And you're bad at it.

298
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,030
Thank you.

299
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,900
For your honesty. Yeah, is it...
are you cool?

300
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,234
Oh, so much do I appreciate you for that.
Thank you.

301
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:38,502
Okay, good. That must
have been hard for you.

302
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:39,720
It was.
To say.

303
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,705
Can I be honest with you?
I-I need you to.

304
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:43,073
Right?
Right.

305
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:45,242
Okay, so the veterinarian thing.
Yeah.

306
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,911
I feel like the only reason
you wanted to be a vet

307
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,613
was to keep the skins.

308
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,649
What?

309
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,197
You want to keep
the skins, don't you?

310
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:56,020
There's no denying the
skins are fascinating.

311
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:57,848
It's the most fascinating
part of the animal.

312
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,623
The skin of any animal is
the most fascinating part,

313
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:00,958
Mmm... but that's not why
I wanted to become...

314
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:03,360
Also you're going bald.
I'm going bald?!

315
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,629
What are you talking about?! Just in...
in the interest of being real.

316
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:08,332
Where in the hell am I possibly going bald?
In the back of your head...

317
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,633
There's no evidence of that.
There's quite a bit of ev...

318
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,468
I'll get two mirrors;
I'll show it to you.

319
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:13,237
Don't get mirrors, because...
You're not gonna find anything.

320
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,672
I see fat spilling
over the back of your pants

321
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,973
on a pretty regular basis.

322
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,024
What the hell are
you talking about?!

323
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:18,709
I'm just trying to let you know.

324
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:20,060
And by the way,
there's no reason

325
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:21,612
why a bald man who enjoys skins

326
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:23,180
who has a little bit of
extra something-something

327
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,815
around his belly can't be
a goddamn veterinarian!

328
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,834
Okay, you know what, I can act!
You are a wrinkled bitch!

329
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,385
I'm gonna tell you something,
my characters are good.

330
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:29,653
Okay, let's stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

331
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,789
I-I don't want to do
this with you, okay?

332
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,323
Do you see what's
happening? We're...

333
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:35,325
We just jumped right back in;
we just leapt right back in.

334
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,660
Into our old routines.
Same old place.

335
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:37,728
And I-I don't want
to do that, okay?

336
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:39,713
'Cause... Let's
just focus here.

337
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,398
Here's what we're gonna do.

338
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,866
We're gonna polish off this wine.
Yeah.

339
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,351
And then we're gonna open
up a new bottle of vino.

340
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,669
Ooh.

341
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:47,638
And let's talk about
our real futures.

342
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:48,839
♪ I'll be gone
till November... ♪

343
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:50,941
To new beginnings.

344
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,609
♪ And tell my girl, yo,
I'll be gone till... ♪

345
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,754
Dennis.

346
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,489
Dennis, wake up.

347
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,473
Aah.

348
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:11,161
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

349
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,063
Look what we did.

350
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:19,136
Is that a crack pipe?

351
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:20,404
Yes.

352
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:21,572
No, no.
No.

353
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,891
No, no, no.

354
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,643
How'd this happen again?

355
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,448
Well, it looks like we drank
everything in the entire world,

356
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:34,251
and then we went out
and bought some crack,

357
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,285
and we smoked it.

358
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:36,687
Yeah, a-a-all right,
that's fine.

359
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,956
No, n-no, we just,
we... we slipped up.

360
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,124
It's-it's not a big deal.

361
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:41,225
Like, we'll...
you know,

362
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,993
we'll... pull
ourselves together,

363
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:44,294
and we'll, you know,
we'll get back on crack.

364
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:46,296
I mean, on track.

365
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,632
Unless, um, you have more crack.

366
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,000
No, Dennis, I don't
have more crack.

367
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,435
No one in the history of crack

368
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,137
has ever woken up in the
morning with more crack.

369
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,472
Okay, but if I'm
being honest with you,

370
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,775
if I'm being very, very real,

371
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,843
I need to be high
on crack cocaine right now.

372
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:01,445
You know what we can do?
I've got a great idea.

373
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,696
Once we get Frank's money,

374
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:03,847
we'll just take
all of that money

375
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,315
and put ourselves in rehab,

376
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:06,250
'cause we're not gonna
stop smoking crack.

377
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,718
It's all I'm thinking about.

378
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,019
All right, so we just
got to figure out

379
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:09,870
another way to get some money.

380
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:12,222
I have a idea.

381
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,293
Hi.

382
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,028
I'm a recovering crackhead,

383
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,447
and this is my donkey-brained
sister that I take care of.

384
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,211
I'd like some welfare, please.

385
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,035
You're a recovering
crack addict,

386
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:27,871
and your sister has...

387
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,623
the brains of a donkey?

388
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,809
Mmm.

389
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:33,660
We thought that you might
be a little bit skeptical,

390
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:34,628
so we brought proof.

391
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,879
Dee?

392
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:44,655
Well, you clearly replaced the
name Frank with the name Dee,

393
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,308
and you crossed out the word
"not" on this document.

394
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,361
Nevertheless, I do not know
what the hell this document is.

395
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:53,514
Well, that's... that's an
official State's, uh...

396
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,065
I'm gonna go ahead and stop you.

397
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:57,000
None of this matters to me.

398
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,936
So I don't need
the whole song and dance.

399
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:02,756
If you want welfare...

400
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:05,509
you'll just have to fill out
a bunch of this paperwork,

401
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,678
'cause I'm done
with this bullshit.

402
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,013
This is good news.

403
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,715
This is great, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.

404
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:12,950
I mean, times have really changed.
They have, I know.

405
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:14,551
You just fill out
the paperwork now.

406
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:16,620
You don't have to prove
anything, you know what I mean?

407
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,722
You just get the money now. Obama
just gives you the money; it's great.

408
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,224
There's a lot of paperwork to fill out,
though. Yeah, could you write faster?

409
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:21,491
I need some more crack.

410
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,693
I'm starting to come
down pretty hard.

411
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,011
Okay, listen, Dee,

412
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,095
I'm writing as fast
as I can, okay?

413
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:26,997
I-I also want crack.
Sorry.

414
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,916
I don't get why we're coming
here to find a roommate.

415
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,701
You know, what about living
with the waitress, too?

416
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,069
The waitress is not going
to live with you.

417
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,637
This is our only option, okay?

418
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,639
People in the welfare store
are in a pinch, so are you.

419
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,506
Yeah, that's a good point.

420
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:37,608
Uh...

421
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:38,542
Wait.

422
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,532
Is that Dennis and Dee?

423
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:40,994
Hi.

424
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,346
Hey, guys.

425
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,047
Wh-What are you
doing here?

426
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,082
Yeah, did you get Frank
to write the check?

427
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,516
Dude, we're well on our way.

428
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,051
Yeah, but in the meantime,

429
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,586
we came here because we need
some money to buy crack.

430
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:50,787
You guys
are smoking crack again?

431
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,005
It's not a big deal,
because, uh,

432
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,557
as soon as we get
that check from Frank,

433
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:54,708
we're just gonna zip right off
to a-a rehab program.

434
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,826
Yeah, we'll get in rehab.

435
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,227
You guys are back on crack,

436
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,129
Frank brought strippers
back to my place,

437
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:00,931
we're all bumping into each
other at the welfare store,

438
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,033
and yet I'm the only person
who thinks it's 2006.

439
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,418
♪ You, you got what I need... ♪

440
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,136
Oh...
What?

441
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:07,604
It's him!
It's him, everyone, shut up.

442
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,773
Oh, it's Frank, shut up!
Okay? Shh.

443
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,525
Hey, Frank. Daddy.

444
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,510
Daddy. Yeah. Hi, how are you?

445
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:15,479
What's up?

446
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:16,847
No shit.

447
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,248
No shit!

448
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,766
Yes, we will be there
in just a few minutes.

449
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,702
Okay, bye!
What is it, what do you...

450
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:22,868
Oh, shit, great news, guys.

451
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,054
Great news.
No problem with the check.

452
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:25,255
We just gotta meet
with his money man

453
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,456
and he's just gonna
write it to us.

454
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:27,988
Big fat check for us.
Oh, my God, yes.

455
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,293
We're going to see money man.
Get rid of that!

456
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:30,761
All right.
Let's go get some crack.

457
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,112
Yeah. I mean the check.
We're gonna...

458
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,497
Right, yeah.
Get some crack.

459
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,066
Still need a roommate, right?

460
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,367
Yeah, what about this guy?

461
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:38,769
Oh, come on, man.

462
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,387
Don't just do that, you know?

463
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:41,755
Knew you were gonna do that.

464
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,800
Anyone else.
Look at him.

00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,121
He passed...

474
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,590
Jerry!

475
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,825
Jerry, come on in here,
don't give me that.

476
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,710
Don't make your secretary
pull that bit on us.

477
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:13,262
Come on, Jerry.

478
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,663
Um, I'm not his secretary

479
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:15,948
and he's been dead for years.

480
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,199
Really. So...

481
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,868
Uh...
well, anyway,

482
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,705
my kids turned me on
to an idea last night.

483
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:24,506
Yeah. All right, look, tell
'em about your invention.

484
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,575
Well, the charity that...
Huh?

485
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:29,228
Not the, not the charity.
The phone.

486
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,113
The phone--
they're being modest.

487
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,381
Tell her, show her
about the phone.

488
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,783
Show the broad the phone.

489
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,862
You goddamn bitch!

490
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,897
You wouldn't know a good idea
if it smacked you in a tit.

491
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,533
She's gonna be gone by 2007,
you mark my words.

492
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,868
She's a stupid...

493
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,136
stupid idiot.
Yes, she's a dumb...

494
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,137
dumb bitch.
A stupid moron.

495
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,505
So, those people on Haiti.

496
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,007
Now we can help them
with the mon-- your money.

497
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,509
No, no... Haiti?
Haiti's a lost cause.

498
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,411
You might as well sink
that goddamn island.

499
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,712
- What are you talking about?
- No, not a lost cause,

500
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,484
no, you said you wanted
to help poor people.

501
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,082
I am going to help
the poor people.

502
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:09,385
I'm gonna help you,
because you are my children

503
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,953
and I gotta think
of your future.

504
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,388
W-What?

505
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:13,856
This is for you.

506
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:16,091
There you go.

507
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,893
Oh!

508
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,561
Oh, that's a lot of zeroes!
Oh, Dee...

509
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,929
Yeah, that's a lot of zeroes.

510
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:22,281
Yeah. We will.
Oh, Daddy, we're gonna do

511
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:23,482
such good things with this money.
Yes.

512
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,750
We're gonna help people,
we're gonna invent.

513
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:26,769
Let's do it now, though.
Let's move.

514
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:27,936
Yeah, we'll go deposit it. Invent,
invent, invent, invent, right.

515
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,438
That was a very good
decision-- thank you!

516
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,673
Do it right away,
do it right away.

517
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,874
You're a great dad.

518
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:32,741
Oh, Daddy!
You're a great dad.

519
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,676
You're right.

520
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,513
You are crackheads, children.

521
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,817
<i>I want to thank you,
gentlemen, for your interest</i>

522
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:43,285
in the roommate position.

523
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:44,286
You're both
excellent candidates.

524
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,504
We have Edgar

525
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,439
and Trevor,

526
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,491
who is an aspiring
jazz musician.

527
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,926
That's interesting,

528
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:53,278
because Charlie is actually
a musician himself.

529
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:55,597
Mmm, don't really
care for jazz, though.

530
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,366
A lot of unnecessary notes.

531
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,331
Hey!

532
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,636
Got room for one more?

533
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:01,945
Frank, what are you doing here?

534
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,255
Charlie, the other night

535
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,390
was the greatest night
of my life.

536
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:05,774
I used to live like that,

537
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:06,775
in filth and squalor.

538
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:08,043
I want to do it again.

539
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,395
Absolutely not.
We are not doing this again.

540
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,612
You know what?
I'm gonna consider it.

541
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:11,624
Gah... Frank, have a seat.

542
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:12,998
Oh, Charlie.
Yeah, yeah,

543
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:13,982
have a seat, all right.
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:15,150
All right, let's begin.

545
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:17,653
Okay, uh, first topic
is cat food.

546
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:18,821
You want to lead with that?
Mm-hmm.

547
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:20,689
Cat food.
Yeah.

548
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:22,458
Okay. You find a can of cat
food in the apartment.

549
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:24,226
What do you do with it?

550
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,295
I don't do nothing with it.

551
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,480
Don't touch my shit,

552
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:31,550
I don't touch your shit.

553
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,901
Great.
Okay.

554
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,286
He-he doesn't touch your shit...
Yeah.

555
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,888
That was very clear.
...and then you don't...

556
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,733
So eloquent. Very clear.
What are you writing?

557
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,425
I filled in half
the can of cat food.

558
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,893
It's sort of a half-full answer.
Great.

559
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,529
Trevor, your position
on the matter?

560
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:45,431
I'd ask if the can is yours,

561
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:47,149
and, uh, if so,

562
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:49,084
would you like me
to feed the cat?

563
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,620
Oh... Oh, see, now he assumes

564
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,088
that you have a cat.
Right.

565
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:54,723
Smart. He doesn't
have a cat.

566
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,091
Yeah, so... Oh.

567
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,359
Yeah.

568
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,494
Kind of a waste
to-to feed a cat

569
00:17:58,546 --> 00:17:59,878
that's not mine.

570
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:02,765
For me, it depends
on how hungry I was.

571
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,383
Or sleepy.

572
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:05,784
Oh, very interesting.

573
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,086
Couple of points for
Frank right there.

574
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,411
W-Why?
Well, I don't understand.

575
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:10,239
He gets points for...

576
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:13,125
Yeah, eating it and then...
Well, if I was hungry

577
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,810
and the cat food was there, I'd eat it.
And if you were sleepy...

578
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,078
If I couldn't go to sleep...
You would...

579
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,362
I would eat the cat food
and go to sleep.

580
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:18,647
'Cause it might
make you go to sleep!

581
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:19,815
All right.
In what scenario

582
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:21,183
do you not eat the cat food?

583
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:22,925
I would always eat the cat food.
Yeah, no.

584
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:24,393
Exactly right.
See, now there's a man

585
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:25,735
who's-who's thinking
on his feet.

586
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,322
Trevor is
a great roommate.

587
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:28,991
He's a nice guy;
he doesn't have

588
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,793
the experience, though.
Experience? In what?

589
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,828
Well, all these good things.
Let's keep talking.

590
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:35,080
Hey, I'm sorry, am I...
too late? Oh.

591
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,632
Wow, hi.

592
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,050
What-what are you
doing here?

593
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,601
I called her, actually.
I left her a message

594
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,170
'cause I thought she might need
a place to live.

595
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:43,605
The last couple of years
have been pretty rough on me,

596
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,707
and now I'm living
in a women's shelter, so...

597
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,142
Oh... Yeah, I figured that.
'Cause she's the worst.

598
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:48,527
Is the apartment
still available or not?

599
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,092
Well, yeah, it's
definitely available.

600
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:51,380
Great.
Yes!

601
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:52,564
Oh, I've brokered a deal!

602
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,783
Oh, no, come on, Charlie.

603
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,585
I-I'm sorry, Frank,

604
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,086
but you know I'm not gonna
give up an opportunity

605
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,221
to have The Waitress
as a roommate.

606
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,672
A roommate?
N-n-n... no, no.

607
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,224
No, no, you did not say that.
You did not say

608
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:03,436
he would still be living here.

609
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,927
That's true,
I did not say that,

610
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,728
because I didn't think
you would come if I did.

611
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,497
Yeah, well, you're goddamn right
I wouldn't have come.

612
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:09,998
I am not living with Charlie.
Are you kidding?

613
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,167
I would rather live
on the streets.

614
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,035
You'd rather live on the streets?
Yeah.

615
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,319
What? Ow!

616
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,954
Ow, my God!
What are you doing?

617
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,339
Put me down! What the
hell are you doing?

618
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:18,574
Charlie, what are you doing? Ow!

619
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,676
I was gonna throw her
out the window

620
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,544
and send her back to 2006! You were
going to throw me out the window?

621
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:23,846
- What the hell is wrong with you?!
- It's a time portal!

622
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,881
Back in time!
We could start over again!

623
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,083
This is really good.

624
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,689
This is ham soaked in rum.

625
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,723
Rum ham, rum ham.

626
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:35,624
...and make me another.

627
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,176
Rum ham!

628
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:37,981
Who wants rum ham?

629
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:39,828
<i>Rum ham.</i>

630
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,099
- You are such a psycho.
- The window is a time portal

631
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,651
to 2006. What is
he talking about?

632
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:47,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

633
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,938
What the hell's everybody doing
in my apartment?

634
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:55,060
We having a gang bang?

635
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,478
Oh, my God. Get...

636
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,813
get the hell out of my way.

637
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,314
Welcome back, Frankie!

638
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:01,817
Oh, the farts, man.

639
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:03,352
That's good.
Oh. Oh, the fart.

<i>Yeah, sorry,</i>

641
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,155
I can't cash this check.

642
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:09,124
Why? I mean,
I know the number's really,

643
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,742
really big, but the check
is real. Are you sure you...

644
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,494
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's a real check.

645
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,495
No, it's outdated.

646
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,787
No, he just wrote it yesterday.

647
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,082
No, it is clearly dated 2006.

♪ Oh, baby, you got
what I need... ♪
