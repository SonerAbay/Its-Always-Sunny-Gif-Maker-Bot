1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,505
[Dee] I don't know.
What do you think?

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,008
It's kind of doing nothing for my hip
area and making a mess of my boobs.

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,636
You know what?
Why don't you go grab five more?

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,430
Look, we don't
normally do this.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,850
But I think I'm gonna need some proof
that you're actually getting married.

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,852
What? Why?

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,439
Because you've been coming in here and
trying on wedding dresses every Saturday...

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,441
for over a year now.

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,861
Yeah. That's 'cause it takes a
really long time to plan a wedding.

10
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,573
Don't get up all over my balls, Lucy.
Just go get the dresses.

11
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,617
When is the wedding?
Soon.

12
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,202
Where?
A church.

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,829
Which one?
The nearby one.

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,414
The nearby one?
Right down the street.

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,998
Which street?
Spring.

16
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,625
What's your fiancé's name?
Sam.

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,585
What does he do?
S-S-Salt.

18
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,214
Salt? Sea... salt.
Sea salt.

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,383
He's a salt seaman.

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,762
He- He dives in to the ocean
for the sea salt.

21
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,974
And then he brings it back up.
And then we eat it.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,352
So- Okay, I'm getting the manager.

23
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:05,565
Well, don't get the- [Sighs] Damn it.

24
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,485
- Dee Reynolds?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,779
Brad Fisher.
From high school.

26
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,323
Brad Fisher.
No way.

27
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,743
Yeah.
You look amazing.

28
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,870
Your acne cleared up
really well.

29
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,623
I kinda grew into myself.
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,168
Why did I ever break up with you, you beefcake?
It was because of the acne.

31
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,212
Was it because of the acne? Yeah.
Yeah. Uh, when it got real bad,

32
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,175
you dumped me and you said it was 'cause I was
gonna grow up to look like Edward James Olmos.

33
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,886
Well, I don't really remember
saying exactly that.

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,596
It's- It's fine.
We were kids. We were kids.

35
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,723
We were kids!
Yeah.

36
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,183
We're not kids anymore.
No.

37
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,603
Great. Wow. So you're-
you're getting married. Wow.

38
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,397
Yeah. Uh, no, I'm not.
I'm not.

39
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,400
This is because I was.
But that- that didn't work out.

40
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,360
Why are you asking?
Are you single?

41
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,821
What's your situation?
Um, I'm engaged.

42
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,948
Oh. Yeah.
I mean, that's why I'm here.

43
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,618
My fiancée's trying on a dress.
I know I'm not supposed to see it before the wedding.

44
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,412
But we're having a whole
nontraditional kinda small thing.

45
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,414
So you should meet her. Babe.
Well, nah...

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,625
- [Woman] Yeah? - Come here for a second.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

47
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,545
What do you think of this one, Brad?
It's beautiful, yeah.

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,089
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,711
[Buzzing] [Mac] Okay.
All right.

50
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,089
Well, don't poke at it.
Don't just poke...

51
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,591
Just get it safely into the box.
Dude, you're gonna agitate the bees.

52
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,262
Well, I'm fine with the bees.
It's the honey I don't want to agitate.

53
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,347
Is that your endgame
here? Honey?

54
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,267
Yeah. I figure if we keep the hive in
the basement, we'll always have honey.

55
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,269
[Buzzing] We'll always have
bees is what we'll always have.

56
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,229
Whoa!
What? What?

57
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,273
I think I just saw a wasp.
I think that was a wasp.

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,899
You see that? Looked like a wasp.
Didn't look like a bee.

59
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,317
Is this a wasp nest?
This is a wasp nest.

60
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,986
I'm out! I'm out!
All right. Yeah, yeah.

61
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,322
I don't want to tangle with a bunch of wasps.
Hey! Do- Do wasps make honey?

62
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,576
[Buzzing] No.
Wasps do not make honey.

63
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,369
All right. Well, I'm gonna
check it out anyway.

64
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,622
There could be something delicious in
here that wasps do make, and I want that.

65
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,126
Mac, Dennis, can I talk to you
in the office, please?

66
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,336
Why can't we just talk right here?
Yeah?

67
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,339
Because it's private. Ah, that sounds
like a whole thing. I'm not into it.

68
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:39,176
- Mmm.
- [Screaming] Shit!

69
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,804
I just got stung! That was a hornet!
This is a hornets nest!

70
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,348
Uh, you know what, guys?
Why don't we step in the back office...

71
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,934
while Charlie deals with this
whole hornet/wasp situation?

72
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,269
Yeah.

73
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,355
Oh. Oh, I'm a bad boy?
I'm a bad boy?

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,902
Put some vegetable oil on it.
That'll make you feel better. Okay. Bye, sexy.

75
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,614
Ohh. Who was that?

76
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,075
That's my booty call.
We're into some really weird food fetish stuff.

77
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,078
Gross. Okay, you guys, listen up.
We got a serious problem.

78
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,414
The waitress is getting married.

79
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,334
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
Artemis told me.

80
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,503
- Since when do you talk to Artemis?
- She's my booty call.

81
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,505
Weird.
We'll get into that later.

82
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,507
Right now, we gotta deal
with this waitress situation.

83
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,551
Dee, why do you give a shit that
the waitress is getting married?

84
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,678
She's been nothing but trouble for us.
That's a good point.

85
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,388
She doesn't seem to
get our sense of humor.

86
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,515
We do stuff that I think's funny.
She doesn't. Hilarious!

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,893
Guys! I cannot believe you're not
thinking about Charlie right now.

88
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,604
This is gonna crush him. What?
You don't give a shit about Charlie.

89
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,690
All you care about is the fact the waitress
is getting married before you. Right?

90
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,568
That or she's afraid that Charlie
might blow his brains out.

91
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,029
And then she'd have to do all the Charlie work.
Uh, that's what it is. Yeah.

92
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,950
Okay, fine. A: I do not want to do
Charlie's work once he kills himself.

93
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,578
B: How could the waitress get married before me?
I'm way hotter than she is.

94
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:52,041
And C: Get this. The guy she's
marrying used to be my boyfriend.

95
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,251
You know what I just realized?
I don't care about anything she's saying.

96
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,253
Not a bit. What I do care
about is the fact that...

97
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,298
Charlie might go postal if he finds
out about this and kill all of us.

98
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,134
Right. Shit. We're probably the
ones at real risk here, huh?

99
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,763
Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe we should
find something to distract him...

100
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,932
until the whole wedding
thing blows over. Mm-hmm.

101
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,976
- Get him his own booty call.
- Ohh!

102
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,727
Or at least another chick to stalk.
Hey!

103
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,729
Great. In the meantime,
I'll try and sabotage the wedding...

104
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,731
by luring Brad away from her.
Ahh.

105
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,192
Dee, save yourself the embarrassment.
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,236
Let's-
Watch out for the hornets.

107
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,572
Yeah.
Don't push me.

108
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,201
[Knocking]

109
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,036
[Door Opens]
Hey-oh!

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,330
Hey, what's-
Ahh!

111
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,873
What are you
doing there, buddy?

112
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,835
I'm trying to smoke these hornets
to death so I can get their honey.

113
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,422
They keep flying up the tube, stinging me on my face.
I think I just swallowed one.

114
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,259
As I tried to explain before, you
cannot get honey from a hornets nest.

115
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,720
I just don't think there's any
science to support that, buddy.

116
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,180
There's some very basic science
out there supporting that. No.

117
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,640
No.
Trust me, pal.

118
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,559
It's a fact. It's not even science.
Why are you bothering...

119
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,686
getting into it with him?
I don't know. I just feel like...

120
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,479
Charlie, we're gonna get you
back on the dating scene, bro.

121
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,398
What do you think about that? Yeah.
That's actually why we're here.

122
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,983
We're gonna put your profile
on Match.com.

123
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,569
I don't see why.
I got the waitress, guys.

124
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,653
Yeah.
Yeah, right.

125
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,946
Sure, right.
Uh, yeah, totally.

126
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,656
We thought maybe you could
meet somebody new. Yeah.

127
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,033
Someone you like even more
than the waitress.

128
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,367
I don't see
how that's possible.

129
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,619
But I tell you what, let me
pop a quick "H" on this box.

130
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,539
This way we all know
it's filled with the hornets.

131
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay? Okay, yeah.
Do what you gotta do.

132
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,252
These things sting
like a bitch, man.

133
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,296
First thing we gotta do is take
your picture for the profile. So...

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,006
Ahh.
So, do you have the makeup?

135
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,050
- Yeah.
- Oh, no makeup! Come on.

136
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,552
Well, those hornet stings are pretty bad, buddy.
So I think we're gonna have to...

137
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,846
Yeah.
But I am who I am.

138
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:29,972
Right. But-
Yeah, but...

139
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,557
Let's do who you are
minus the hornet stings.

140
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,726
Let's pretend you're not who you are
and just try to attract a woman.

141
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,021
I tell you what. What if I wore a checkered
hat and I smoked a pipe? That'd work.

142
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,524
Why would you want
a checkered hat and a pipe?

143
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,777
You know,
for the Sherlock Holmes look.

144
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,820
Why would you want to look
like Sherlock Holmes?

145
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,281
- Who are you trying to attract exactly?
- Intelligent women.

146
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,492
Okay. I'm just gonna take the photo

290
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,226
Everybody's stealing
my Charlie, girl!

291
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,396
- Oh! What the hell! - Okay, Brad.
I think it's time for us to go.

292
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,981
We're gonna leave.
All right.

293
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,942
Wait, no. No, no, no, no, Brad.
No, don't leave yet. I'm sorry.

294
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,903
Hold on. No, no, don't leave.
Oh, you bitch!

295
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,072
Oh! Goddamn it!
I should be the one getting married!

296
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,285
This is depressing. Want to go get
sweaty in the bathroom? Sure do.

297
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,038
No! No one's getting sweaty in my bathroom!
Just get out of here!

298
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,874
Okay. We'll go get sweaty
in a Wendy's bathroom.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,709
Great! Go have sex at Wendy's!
Go for a ride.

300
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,252
Wonderful!
Get out of here!

301
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,588
- This party sucks!
- You suck!

302
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,883
- I need a ride. - Oh, really?
Well, I ain't giving you shit, you old bitch!

303
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,511
- [Knocking] - Oh, my God, no!
You can't borrow salad dressing!

304
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,306
Or condiments! Or anything else you
two want to jam up into each other's...

305
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,934
I, uh-
I forgot something.

306
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,561
Oh. What?

307
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,773
I forgot to tell you...

308
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,108
I still love you.

309
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,077
Hi.
Hi.

310
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,330
Are you Charlie Kelly?
Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yeah.

311
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,457
Sorry I'm late. Um-
You're Jackie.

312
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,044
Yes, I am.
[Laughs] Are you all right?

313
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:44,299
Oh, yeah, this?
I was running.

314
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,760
Okay, because y-you're bleeding.
Oh, shit.

315
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,804
Is it bleeding again?
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,056
These are hornet stings,
you know?

317
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,850
I run into, like- like a lot of,
like, hornets in my line of work.

318
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,562
And I get stung up, like, bad
all over my face and stuff.

319
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,606
And then, you know, it
starts bleeding. Oh.

320
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,733
It sounds interesting.
Yeah.

321
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,652
What is it that you do again?

322
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,655
I'm work- I'm like a janitor at, um...

323
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,075
I'm a full-on rapist,
you know?

324
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,872
Uh, Africans, dyslexics,
children, that sort of thing.

325
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,086
I'm sorry. Did you say
you're a full-on rapist?

326
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,299
No! Did I say that?
No! No, no, no, no!

327
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,010
I help- I help people.
You know what I mean? I'm...

328
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,679
I'm a philan-
a philan- a philan...

329
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,890
A philanthropist? Yeah!
That's exactly what it is.

330
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,686
It gets blocked up in my mouth.
I don't say it no good, so...

331
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,524
I'm a janitor at a bar.

332
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,279
Oh, God, dude!
I'm sucking ass!

333
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,239
Yeah, dude.
You said you were a rapist!

334
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,241
I went crazy in the brain
for a second!

335
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,702
Yeah. And my eyes were all like,
uh- And I couldn't think straight.

336
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,996
That shirt is ruined. I know, dude.
Give me your shirt.

337
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,789
What? Give you-
That's a totally different shirt.

338
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,876
Yeah. Can I- How the hell are
you gonna explain that to her?

339
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,878
I'll say I met a nice guy in the
bathroom and we traded shirts!

340
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
Are you listening to yourself?
Jesus Christ!

341
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,923
I'm freaking out, dude.
Okay, new plan. New plan. New plan.

342
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,884
Charlie, make a move.
Just tell her you want to bang her.

343
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,846
Ooh. No, that's- Is that how you get chicks?
Well, he's got a 50-50 shot.

344
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,765
- That's a good point!
- It is a yes-or-no scenario.

345
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,433
It is a no scenario!
Why?

346
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,727
Don't approach her that way.
That's not gonna work. Am I getting the shirt?

347
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,812
You're not gonna get the shirt.
This is what you're gonna do.

348
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,898
Go back out there.
Start asking her questions about herself.

349
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,525
Talk to her about being a lawyer, okay?
I can do that.

350
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,361
Right? Right?
That's gonna work.

351
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,738
If anything goes wrong, I'll come out there,
I'll say I'm the manager of Gugino's.

352
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,114
Do you understand?
Okay.

353
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,991
All right? I got it.
I know. I understand it.

354
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,992
You good?
We'll be good.

355
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,703
All right, great.
[Groaning]

356
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,251
Just go. Just get out there.
Just go. Yeah.

357
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,298
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
It took a little while.

358
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,593
There was a guy in the bathroom.
He wouldn't give me his shirt. And I was fighting him.

359
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,262
I'm, like, "Give me your shirt, bro.
" And he didn't want to give it to me.

360
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,682
- And it was like a whole thing.
- Uh, uh, uhh!

361
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,977
Hi. Uh, I'm the manager. And Mr.
Kelly is one of our preferred customers.

362
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,647
It's so wonderful to see you here again
this evening. Right. My good man.

363
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,775
Now I'm gonna want the milk
steak boiled over hard...

364
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:11,321
and a side of your finest
jellybeans, raw. [Laughs]

365
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,699
Mr. Kelly, you have the most
wonderful sense of humor.

366
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,660
Hey, I own this joint.
And I know this guy. And he is loaded.

367
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,330
Mr. Kelly, we have your milk boiling just the
way you like it back there for your steak.

368
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,458
You're gonna like this.
How's about I clear out the coat room...

369
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,545
and you guys hit it in there
while the steak is getting ready?

370
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,255
- What?
- What in the hell are you doing?

371
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,297
I got this.
He's gonna be aggressive.

372
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,174
I've got this.
Charlie, make a move. Maul.

373
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,592
No, don't-
Oh, my God!

374
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,886
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving!

375
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,555
You're grabbing her breasts?
What are you doing?

376
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,306
I don't know. What does
"make a move" mean?

377
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,184
It doesn't mean stab at her breasts
with your fingers. Oh, man!

378
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,437
Come on, bro. You're ordering milk
steak and jellybeans? What the hell?

379
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,689
Come on, you guys blew it, dude!
We blew it?

380
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,567
I told you to stick with the game plan!
It was going great! I had it!

381
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,776
You don't know shit
about chicks, man!

382
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,945
- We don't know shit about chicks?
- Yeah!

383
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,614
Well, guess what, bro. The waitress
is getting married. So suck on that!

384
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,579
I see.

385
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,833
Well, I suppose I'll be taking
that milk steak to go then.

386
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:15,093
Yeah. And so the Wendy's manager
is all, "You gotta clean that up!"

387
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,137
And I said, "They're your hamburgers.
You clean 'em up."

388
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,306
And then Artemis
got all bummed out...

389
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,600
because of something
I did with the onions to myself.

390
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,353
And now she won't talk to me.
Frank, I don't give a shit about any of this.

391
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,272
Hey, man, where's
the baseball bat?

392
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,940
Baseball bat in the corner.
Oh.

393
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,318
We're trying to arm ourselves 'cause
Charlie's gonna be here any minute,

394
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,361
and he might take us out, so...

395
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:37,240
Oh, don't worry about Charlie.
Charlie's over this.

396
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:42,037
In fact, I saw him this morning.
He said he was bringing the guy a congratulatory gift.

397
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,623
Really?
Yeah.

398
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,916
Oh, great.

[Doorbell Buzzes]

Hey, what's- what's, uh-
what's this?

401
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,721
This is for your engagement, man.
You're a lucky, lucky dude.

402
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,681
And, uh, congratulations to you.
Oh, right.

403
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,643
No, no, no. That's not happening anymore.
We're not, uh- We're not engaged.

404
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,312
You're not getting married?
Nah.

405
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,857
Oh!
You're Charlie Kelly, right?

406
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,652
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember you from high school.

407
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,862
Hang on a second, dude.
You're not getting married?

408
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,156
Well-
[Clears Throat]

409
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,868
Remember how everybody used to
make fun of us in high school?

410
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,704
I remember how
they made fun of you.

411
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,959
Anyway, I have been
getting my revenge.

412
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,254
I've been getting engaged to all these chicks
who broke up with me in high school...

413
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,881
'cause of my acne, and then I dump
'em right before the wedding.

414
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,467
[Chuckles] Damn.

415
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,511
Yeah. I just got through doing it
to that coffee shop waitress.

416
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,638
Now I'm gonna do it to this chick
Dee Reynolds. Remember her?

417
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,807
She was the worst.
Yeah.

418
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:48,603
Uh, so that coffee shop waitress, she must've
been hurt kinda bad by that though, right?

419
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,273
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She was- She was devastated.

420
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,316
Oh.
So...

421
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:57,153
Well, tell you what, man. Why don't you
go ahead and have this present anyway?

422
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,408
Really? Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I feel like you deserve it.

423
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,369
[Chuckles] Well, thanks, dude.
Yeah.

424
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,497
That's- That's rad.
All right. Okay.

Well, keep it real, man.
Okay. Okay.
