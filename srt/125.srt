1
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,429
Oh, Christ, does every single
one of these kids have the flu?

2
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:16,197
Seems like it.

3
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:18,168
All right, now I bet you guys
are wondering what's going on

4
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:20,203
- with this racing suit, huh?
- No, not even a little bit.

5
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:21,672
You're like,
"What's that rascal Charlie up to?"

6
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:23,705
"What's he up to this time?"
Right, right?

7
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:24,805
- I'm not thinking that at all.
- Yeah, yeah, well,

8
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,973
it's an issue of aerodynamics, really.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,411
You see, every second counts
in the water park.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,037
- Right.
- And we plan to ride

11
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:31,376
- every single ride in there today.
- Yup.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,977
Yeah, the brochure says three days.

13
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:33,979
We're saying bullshit to that.

14
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,379
- We're gonna get it done in one.
- One day.

15
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:37,112
All right, well, good luck
with that 'cause you got, like,

16
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,783
ten minutes of clean water and
then every slide's basically

17
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:40,148
a urine delivery system.

18
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,382
- Yeah.
- We're not gonna get

19
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,816
- drenched in piss.
- No.

20
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:44,452
We're gonna go in there,
find our favorite ride,

21
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:45,986
- bomb down it once,
- Yeah.

22
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,488
then sit by the pool the
rest of the day disease-free.

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,820
Don't kid yourself about the water,
buddy.

24
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:50,821
You're not gonna be disease-free;

25
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:51,954
this water's already infested

26
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,189
with every parasite on the planet.

27
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:54,491
And I, for one, have no intention

28
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:55,826
of stepping foot in any of it.

29
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,359
So what do you come to a water park for?

30
00:00:57,394 --> 00:01:00,627
Hot food, cold beer,
bikini'd women seeking relief

31
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,529
from the insufferable
prison of motherhood.

32
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,030
Yeah, lot of pleasures to
be had at the park, Frank.

33
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,664
- None of which involve piss.
- Hmm.

34
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,497
And it's all free, too,
if you know how to get it.

35
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,133
Well, it's not free,
you got to pay to get in.

36
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,534
Not me, I had my bracelet
laminated in the '90s.

37
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,502
I haven't paid to get
in here since I was 14.

38
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,028
- Nice!
- Nice, nice.

39
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:16,870
- Oh, smart.
- Oh, shush! Shush, shush, shush, shush,

40
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,372
- they're about to open!
- Why do we have to shush?

41
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:19,907
Oh, guys! I almost forgot.

42
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,708
Do not go near the pool drains,

43
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,139
no matter how good you might
think they feel on your butt.

44
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:25,742
- What? - Huh?
- What?

45
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,212
You do not sit on those!

46
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:28,845
You know, because of the suction
on your butthole?

47
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,413
No one's thinking about that, man.

48
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:31,712
No one's thinking about that at all.

49
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,746
Oh, good, 'cause it is bad news.

50
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:35,847
Those things will suck the
intestines right out of you.

51
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,216
Like it did to that one kid back in '96.

52
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:39,819
Now, she had to chew
through her intestines

53
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:41,318
- just to get free.
- When I see the drain,

54
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm not gonna go try and sit on it.

55
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,086
- Oh, here we go.
- Okay, here we go! Here we go!

56
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,886
We got to go! Get in there!

57
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,656
- Go! Go! Go!
- Christ!

58
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,380
♪ Kiddie Twister ♪

59
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,535
♪ Kiddie Twister ♪

60
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,493
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

61
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:20,350
- Yeah, Kiddie Twister!
- I'm so excited.

62
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:22,582
- It's been, like, 20 years.
- What's that?

63
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:24,051
Uh, it's a urine tester.

64
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:25,617
Just want to be 100% sure.

65
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,052
It turns light red at the
slightest hint of piss.

66
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:30,452
- And I think we're good.
- Let's roll.

67
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:31,722
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

68
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,029
Slide's for kids only.

69
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,675
Size requirement.

70
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:36,132
Shut up, nerd!

71
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,798
Kiddie Twister!

72
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:42,936
Screw you, nerd!

73
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,935
You're gonna get hurt

74
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,537
Uh, come on, nerd.

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,773
Whoo-hoo! Kiddie Twister!

76
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,972
I don't give a shit.

77
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,876
<i>Kiddie Twister!</i>

78
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,844
Kiddie Twis... Oh, shit!

79
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,178
- Kiddie Twister!
- Wait, Dee, no!

80
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,046
No, I'm stuck, wait!

81
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,147
<i>Ow!</i>

82
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,064
Shit!

83
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:05,983
Ow! Ow, Dee, I'm stuck!

84
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,384
Yeah, no shit!

85
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,117
- Dee, you got to move.
- Me move? You move.

86
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:10,818
You're blocking me.

87
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:13,118
Your stupid wrist band
got us all jammed up.

88
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:14,291
It's not just that.

89
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:17,489
The slide's too small,
the nerd was right.

90
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:19,356
Shit, what are we gonna do?

91
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,490
Uh... okay. Just remain calm, all right?

92
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,226
Do not panic,
that's the worst thing you can do.

93
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,061
Okay, but we got to get unstuck
before they send another kid

94
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,895
because... oh, God,

95
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:28,895
some big, fat kid's just gonna
come blasting down on us.

96
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,589
You're gonna be fine. Trust me.

97
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,698
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!

98
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,035
Jesus Christ!

99
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,668
This is slow, Charlie.

100
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:39,203
I'm never gonna get through this crap.

101
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,424
We should've gone down
the first slide we saw.

102
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:43,815
I know, I know, but we needed
to start at the northmost point

103
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:44,562
of the park, right?

104
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,579
- Then we work our way south,
- Yeah.

105
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,020
and that cuts back on the excess

106
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,028
- running back and forth.
- Oh, yeah.

107
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,511
You know, that said,
I'm sorry I got us so lost.

108
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:53,210
I can't ever tell which
way is north on a map.

109
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:54,811
It's at the top.

110
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,213
- I thought north was, like, up.
- "Up"?

111
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:59,314
Yeah, like if I turn the map this way,
now where is north?

112
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:00,982
- Still at the top of the... no.
- Down?

113
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:03,382
- Now, come on, Charlie, this is ridiculous.
- It's confusing, right?

114
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:04,818
We got to get going here.

115
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,752
- I know, goddamn it.
- Where's he going?

116
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,821
- Coming through. Excuse us.
- What, what?

117
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,353
How come he can cut to the front?

118
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,022
Oh, Ethan is here with a special program

119
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,358
for children with leukemia,

120
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,822
so he skips to the front of the line.

121
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,656
Thank you! Coming through.

122
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,094
AIDS!

123
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,192
AIDS, I got AIDS.
I got AIDS, we're coming through.

124
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,327
- Yeah, yeah, sorry.
- Cutting through.

125
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,729
I'm his doctor, my patient's got to get

126
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,849
- to the front of the line
- Yeah.

127
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,264
- Because he has AIDS.
- I got the AIDS.

128
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,332
He got it from a gay guy in the '80s.

129
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,567
- I'm not gay, I didn't... but...
- Well...

130
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:34,168
There's two kind of AIDS...

131
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,202
there's the vagina AIDS and
then the needle-based AIDS.

132
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,104
I-I'm a vagina guy.

133
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,171
- Well, no, actually my test results show
- I got... sorry, I'm... AIDS.

134
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,406
that it was the gay AIDS.

135
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:42,742
- All AIDS are bad.
- Well...

136
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,007
That's... no good AIDS.

137
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,675
But I'm telling you, like I said,

138
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,175
this is not the gay AIDS.

139
00:04:58,082 --> 00:04:59,748
Lie back down.

140
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,752
One of these little stinkers yours?

141
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,022
My son.

142
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,255
This one here?

143
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,753
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, he's adorable.

144
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,923
You?

145
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,925
Oh, daughter, yeah.

146
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,060
I try to take her to
fun places like this.

147
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,729
Let a little sunshine back into her life

148
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:21,428
ever since her mom...

149
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:25,365
Oh, my God. Did she...

150
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,234
Die horrifically?

151
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,566
Yeah.

152
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,201
Drowning. Kind of ironic,

153
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,368
us being at a water park,

154
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:33,036
but, you know, you got to...

155
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,904
you got to roll with the punches,
you know?

156
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:36,538
Got to get back out
there and live life...

157
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:38,873
Daddy, Daddy, can I borrow $20?

158
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,106
What?

159
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,075
Oh, hi there, what's your name?

160
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,308
Abby.

161
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,576
I'm hungry, Daddy.

162
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,410
Can I please have $20?

163
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,547
Well, I think you can get
something to eat

164
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,279
for a lot less than that, hon.

165
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:52,615
Dad!

166
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,117
I'm hungry, I'm starving,

167
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,248
and you haven't given me any money.

168
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,619
Yeah.

169
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:00,887
What the hell?

170
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:04,454
Anything for my little...

171
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:05,405
Abby.

172
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,994
Interesting.

173
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,396
What's interesting?

174
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,062
Nothing.

175
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,296
I'm done with you.

176
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:20,599
Keep up.

177
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,958
- Aah! Jesus.
- You'd think all the pressure

178
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:27,987
would blast us through.

179
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:30,455
No, it's just squeezing
me further into the stuck!

180
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,957
Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off.

181
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,788
- Just rip it off.
- Dee, I'm trying.

182
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,624
I can't get any actual leverage on it.

183
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,892
Besides, it's triple-laminated.

184
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:38,226
- It's not just gonna rip.
- Oh, no.

185
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,628
- I think someone peed.
- What?!

186
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,893
Sherman, did you pee?

187
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,627
- No.
- Sherman, my vial

188
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:44,063
- is turning light pink.
- Ugh...

189
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,597
goddamn it, Sherman,
I ordered you not to pee!

190
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,564
- Sorry!
- Oh, disgusting!

191
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,899
Sorry's not gonna cut it, Sherman,

192
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,334
- it's not gonna cut it.
- Nobody else pee!

193
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,602
Ah, the sun's just blasting me

194
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:53,835
right in the face.

195
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,237
Why does it have to be right there?

196
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,270
Dee, if God put the sun there,

197
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,840
there's probably a reason, okay?

198
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:00,339
Don't question him; we need God!

199
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:02,340
God didn't put the sun anywhere.

200
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:04,977
The sun stays still;
the Earth moves around it.

201
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:07,910
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Okay. All right.

202
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,943
We gotta get these kids out of here.

203
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,912
All right. I'm going for it.
I'm just pulling on one of 'em.

204
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,015
Come on. Ah, this friggin'
dome's like a magnifying glass.

205
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,116
Get him through, I can get him.

206
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,849
- Get help.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

207
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,854
Kid, kid, kid, listen. Come here.

208
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:25,519
Before you go,

209
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:27,821
no matter how alluring it is,

210
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:29,657
do not put your genitals
or your butthole

211
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,191
near the pool drain. You got it?

212
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,824
- In fact, cover your butthole.
- Okay, go.

213
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,825
- Okay, kid. Go, kid, go!
- Come on. Go.

214
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,092
Cover that butthole, kid!

215
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,761
Mac. Stop talking to children

216
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:38,994
about their buttholes, okay?

217
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,196
- It's not appropriate.
- Okay.

218
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,530
Okay.

219
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,965
Uh, I think we gotta get
another kid out.

220
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,265
You know what?

221
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,932
What about this one?

222
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,465
That kid looks passed out, Dee.

223
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,968
Yeah, he's out cold, but I think

224
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,537
I can maneuver his body pretty easily.

225
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,436
Yeah, but if we send him down there,
he might drown.

226
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,306
Guys, I gotta take a poop.

227
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,547
- I see you stealing.
- I wasn't stealing them!

228
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,983
I just forgot I was wearing them!

229
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:14,516
Let go of me!

230
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,849
My dad's a cop!

231
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,553
Abigail! What is going on in here?

232
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,285
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you.

233
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,853
- This your daughter?
- Yes.

234
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:23,455
Officer Dennis Reynolds.

235
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:24,855
Hi. Off-duty, of course.

236
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,722
This is your jurisdiction.

237
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:28,158
- Look, I caught her stealing sunglasses.
- Yeah?

238
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,026
- No, I didn't! I was just...
- Abigail,

239
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,725
I gave you $20 to buy
whatever you wanted.

240
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,029
What happened to that?
Do you still have it?

241
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,561
Yes.

242
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,697
Well, then you need to
pay for these sunglasses.

243
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,364
Actually, no. You know what?

244
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,865
On second thought, no.

245
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,567
You don't get the sunglasses.

246
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:47,835
- You need to be taught a lesson.
- I think that she gets...

247
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,472
I really appreciate
everything that you do.

248
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:51,803
Real police officer to security guard,

249
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,473
honestly,
I want to thank you for everything.

250
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,339
- Thanks.
- This little girl,

251
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:56,674
she's gonna be grounded for a month.

252
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,209
Come on, Abigail, let's go.

253
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:01,210
Try to touch me, and I'll scream "rape."

254
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,578
Please.

255
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:03,913
I see the road you're headed down:

256
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:05,380
the lying, the stealing, all of it.

257
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:06,648
And as somebody who's
been down that road,

258
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:07,914
let me tell you something:

259
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,148
you've got real talent.

260
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,583
Okay...

261
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,051
Mmm.

262
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,317
That ought to work.

263
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,584
What are you doing?

264
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,019
Oh, it's a simple lunch play.

265
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,689
I tell the burger stand

266
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,420
some hyperactive brat knocked
my food on the ground,

267
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:21,922
they replace it, no questions asked.

268
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:23,590
I usually just swipe a burger

269
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:25,590
off some dumb-ass family
while they're not looking.

270
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,258
Well, that begs the question, Abigail:

271
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,928
you want to be a thief or
do you want to be an artist?

272
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,596
You see, an artist takes whatever

273
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:34,061
he wants when somebody's
looking right at him.

274
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,266
- These are too small for me.
- Yeah.

275
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:43,167
- You get the point.
- Yeah.

276
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,612
- I got AIDS, AIDS.
- AIDS! Guy with AIDS, coming through.

277
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,679
AIDS, coming through. AIDS, AIDS...

278
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:02,937
- AIDS!
- Hey, man, go through.

279
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:03,749
Hey, go for it, go, go, go!

280
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,417
No, you need a raft! You need a raft!

281
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,624
- Ah! Ah!
- Ow!

282
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:23,685
Go.

283
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:26,183
Go.

284
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,962
- My camera!
- Oh, great, your camera.

285
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,364
I was really worried about that.

286
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,063
This is my watch.

287
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:43,377
Go.

288
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,576
Go.

289
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,939
- My sunglasses.
- Oh, all of our chains!

290
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:50,141
You know how hard it is
to get all of our chains.

291
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:51,141
- AIDS...
- AIDS, AIDS!

292
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,880
Ow!

293
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,314
Stop sending kids, nerd!

294
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,481
- You goddamn nerd!
- Go.

295
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:04,150
- We're making good time.
- We're doin' it, Charlie.

296
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:05,719
We're pretty much...
we're pretty much caught up.

297
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:08,420
Whoa, hey, hey, guys!

298
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,385
What are you guys doing?
You guys doing a AIDS thing?

299
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:11,620
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

300
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:12,955
I gave Frank a couple hickeys

301
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,422
- to sell the lesions.
- Sucked on 'em.

302
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,889
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,291
You doing a fake daughter thing?

304
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,658
- Yeah.
- Cool. All right, man, see ya.

305
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:20,501
See ya.

306
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:44,643
Three, two, one, go!

307
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:49,143
I got AIDS!

308
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,464
Yeah!

309
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:00,324
- Frank, we did it, man!
- Charlie!

310
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,659
- With time to spare!
- Charlie! We...

311
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,990
- Every single ride in here!
- We won!

312
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:05,394
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

313
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:06,560
Hey! Suck on that, river rat!

314
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:07,828
Every ride!

315
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,197
- We did it.
- Oh, shit.

316
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,265
Frank. Look at this!

317
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,301
- Oh.
- Oh...

318
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,837
What... what is that?

319
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,668
I don't know.

320
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:22,337
I mean, that-that's not on the map...
what ride is that?

321
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:23,504
Excuse me?

322
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:24,671
- Excuse me, ma'am?
- Yeah?

323
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,073
What is this ride over here?

324
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:27,140
Oh, that's our new slide.

325
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,541
It's, uh, Thunder Gun Express.

326
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,875
We just finished construction.

327
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,376
It'll be open in a few weeks.

328
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,375
- A Thunder Gun ride?
- Yeah.

329
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,543
Like the movie?

330
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,077
Yeah, but there's no water
or anything yet,

331
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,579
- so we still have to test it.
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,045
It's totally dry.

333
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,414
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's not, it's not...

334
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,547
no, but it's not, it's,
it's not open yet.

335
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:42,881
It's Thunder Gun, man. No hesitation.

336
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,716
- No, no, no.
- No surrender. No man left behind.

337
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,251
We got to get to the top of that slide.

338
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,818
And raw-dog the shit out of it!

339
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:52,587
- Mac?
- Yeah?

340
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,255
My vial is blood red.

341
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,892
That's because the water's not
even running through anymore.

342
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:57,391
It's just pooling up.

343
00:12:57,425 --> 00:12:58,991
- Well, I got to tell you something, though, I...
- Huh?

344
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,994
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to hold it much longer.

345
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:02,892
- What?!
- I-I've been in here for so long, I-I...

346
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,728
Don't you do it, Dee! Don't you do it!

347
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,063
The problem is it's already happening.

348
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:07,529
I'm peeing on your shoulder right now.

349
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,410
But I don't mean to, I'm sorry.

350
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:10,531
- It's warm.
- You bitch!

351
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,067
When we get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you!

352
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:13,734
What am I supposed to do?
How are you even holding your pee?

353
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,202
We've been stuck in here forever!

354
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,837
Oh, I peed as soon
as we got in the slide.

355
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,910
- Me, too.
- What?!

356
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:20,039
- Ew!
- What?!

357
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,372
These animals are, they're laughing!

358
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:22,572
Of course they are!

359
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,074
I think they're actually
enjoying this shit!

360
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:25,240
Oh, they love every second of it!

361
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,440
- They're just pissing all over us!
- Goddamn it.

362
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:28,909
We're gonna die in here with them!

363
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,511
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, Dee.

364
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,577
- I've got an idea!
- What?

365
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,079
If we can get Sherman's mouth

366
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,212
to this bracelet,
we can get out of here.

367
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,214
You said you couldn't rip through it.

368
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,215
No, I can't.

369
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,116
But Sherman can chew through it!

370
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,116
Like the girl in the pool drain

371
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,351
when she got her anus stuck,
she chewed through

372
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,455
her prolapsed anus and
chewed herself to freedom.

373
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,122
- What are you talking about?!
- Sherman!

374
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:50,921
Get your mouth to this
bracelet and chew!

375
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:52,055
Aw, screw it. Try it.

376
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,358
Chew like you've never chewed before.

377
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:54,793
Go, Sherman, chew!

378
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,162
Whoa!

379
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,262
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

380
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:04,765
I got some boy to give me this.

381
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:07,298
I said I'd kiss him if he
met me in the parking lot.

382
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:09,966
Then I swiped his wristband,
so he can't get back in.

383
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:11,066
Nice.

384
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,967
Thanks. Well, I got to roll.

385
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,538
What do you mean? Where you going?

386
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,970
We're just getting started.

387
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,438
Yeah, but my mom said
it's time to leave.

388
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:20,771
Wow.

389
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:23,072
That's a disappointing
glimpse into your future.

390
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,209
Now, why don't you tell your mom

391
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:25,476
you want to stick around
for a little while?

392
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:26,543
That won't work.

393
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,144
She never listens to me.

394
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,244
Oh, now, see, no. That bothers me.

395
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,281
A genius whose fate is
controlled by an idiot?

396
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,748
You think I'm a genius?

397
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:37,317
Yes! Yes, I think you're a genius.

398
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:38,652
Are you kidding me?

399
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:40,252
When I was your age,
I couldn't have accomplished

400
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,754
half the things you did today.

401
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,420
See, this is why the
Chinese are destroying us.

402
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:44,755
If you were born in China,

403
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,424
you'd be the head of
some factory by now.

404
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,290
Or they would've thrown you in a river,

405
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,927
'cause you weren't a boy.

406
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,393
All right, it's not a great analogy,

407
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:53,660
but you get my point.

408
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,927
A-Abby...

409
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,661
you deserve better.

410
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,765
Here, I... I want you to have it.

411
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,064
No, what do you mean? You earned that.

412
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,465
No, please, take it.

413
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,101
So you never forget me.

414
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,935
Thanks, Dennis.

415
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:12,206
For being the first adult to
actually give a shit about me.

416
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,308
You!

417
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:20,943
Yes?

418
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,107
We need to have a conversation.

419
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,275
Your daughter is a special kid.

420
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,846
A gifted child who should be treasured.

421
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,111
If she were born in China, she...

422
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,914
Wait, I already did that.

423
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:30,948
Didn't work.

424
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:32,747
If she were born in...

425
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:34,950
What country treasures their women?

426
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:37,251
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

427
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:39,287
Mom, can I have a slushy?

428
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,754
Yes, in just a minute.

429
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:41,986
Is that Abby's brother?

430
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,120
I don't have a daughter.

431
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,457
Yes, you do. The girl that was just...

432
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,891
<i>Please take it.</i>

433
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:54,261
So you never forget me.

434
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:57,730
<i>See, an artist
takes whatever he wants...</i>

435
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,065
...when somebody's looking right at him.

436
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:08,169
What is wrong with you? Why are you...?

437
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,241
Huh.

438
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,111
How would you even describe
something like that?

439
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,546
It's so beautiful.

440
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,380
They should've sent a poet.

441
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:25,513
- All right, let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

442
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,680
- All right, all right.
- Okay.

443
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:29,317
Here we go.

444
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,549
Oh, oh.

445
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:31,986
All right.

446
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:33,183
This should be good, right?

447
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,218
Oh, that's great.

448
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:35,353
- That'll do it.
- Oh!

449
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,688
Who's going first?

450
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,189
Well, it should be you, right?

451
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,556
I mean, you pulled off the AIDS thing.

452
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,557
Oh, Charlie! Charlie!

453
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:43,659
All right!

454
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:44,792
Let's go before we get caught.

455
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:45,793
Let's go before we get busted, okay?

456
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:46,791
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

457
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,193
- All right.
- Ready, Frankie!

458
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,960
- I won't let you down!
- All right!

459
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:52,228
- I like the spirit here.
- Oh!

460
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:54,465
Oh, it burns! It burns!
It burns! It burns!

461
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,300
Aah!

462
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,639
My back!

463
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:05,739
That guy has AIDS!

464
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,871
Aah! Aah, my back!

465
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,977
AIDS! Everybody out.

466
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,478
Aah! Aah!

467
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:21,979
We're free!

468
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:22,980
Oh, my God!

469
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:23,981
Ah, we're free!

470
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,250
My God!

471
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:26,584
Is that blood?

472
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,085
There's AIDS blood in the pool!

473
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,418
That's goddamn AIDS blood?!

474
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,853
Has anyone seen my son?

475
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,156
Goddamn it!

476
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:36,658
I hate this goddamn water park!

477
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,356
