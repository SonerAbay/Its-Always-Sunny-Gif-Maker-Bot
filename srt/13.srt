What?
Hi, mrs. Reynolds.

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,548
What do you want?
Frank sent me over
to pick up his toupee.

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,617
His toupee?
Yep.

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,987
What does he need
his toupee for?
I think he has a date.

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,324
Frank has a date?

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,326
Yeah, I guess.

00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,328
Well, he can't have it.
It's mine.

10
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,264
You own his hair?

11
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,234
All right, fine.
It's in a box in the hallway.

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,236
I was gonna
throw it away anyway.

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,973
So I'm really sorry about this.
I know it's probably
a tough time for you.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,643
Divorce is a tricky thing.
Oh! I found it.

00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,745
I got the hair now.

16
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,582
Found the hair.
So I guess I'll just,
uh, see myself out.

17
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,019
Right. Thank you for the hair.

It looks good.

I leave you alone

Right.

No, that's what

I'm not doing

take it easy?

You do?
Oh, yeah.

Oh, god, that's good news.
What is it?

00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,492
Well, let's just say
I got a little date tonight,

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,795
And as soon as charlie
sees who it is,

00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,798
No more charlie work
for me.

How does that help me?

I guess it doesn't,
really.
Mm-mmm. It sure doesn't.

47
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,641
You know, you should
come up with a plan
just like I did,

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,710
And then you can get out
of charlie work too.

- I think you should do it.
- what?

only comes around
once in a lifetime, right?

- you'd be a fool to let it
slip through your fingers.

that no one ever, ever

Mmm. So you gotta tell me
about all the shit
you been gettin' into.

You must have a police record

Oh, god. No.

Don't be modest now.
You remember all the shit
we used to get into?

Mm-hmm.
You remember that night
in the graveyard?

How could I forget?

that slab was cold, baby.

It was.

And remember the time
we robbed a motorcycle
and ran it into the river?

140
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,615
Yes.
Well, you must be doin' shit
like that now, huh? Come on.

141
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,985
Well, I've slowed down
quite a bit once I met
my husband, carl.

142
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,288
Oh, you told me
you weren't married.

143
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,158
Oh, I'm not.
Carl passed a few years ago.

- oh.
- once I met him and had kids,
I pretty much stayed at home.

145
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,265
Carl had two children
from a previous marriage,

146
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,268
And then we had
five of our own.

147
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,470
Oh, shit.

Hi. I'm jenny.
I'll be your server
this evening.

I think we need just
a little more time.
I'll be back in a second.

What?

153
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,655
Isn't having children
such a blessing?

154
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,623
What the hell
are you talking about?

155
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,361
Well, I mean, when carl passed,
my children were an enormous
source of strength.

156

- for starters,
you've got kids and shit.

And you talk about 'em.

It's not your fault.
It's just, maybe--
I think you're too old for me.

Frank, I'm two years
younger than you.

Okay, what's the deal
with that?

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,368
What?
Why do you keep checking
your cell phone?

171
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,072
I've just been--
I've been expecting
an important phone call.

172
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,741
I'm sorry.
No. Good luck with that.

Don't-- don't go.
I wanna go inside.

No. I'm not gonna
ask you inside, dennis.
Why not?

175
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,852
Because I really...
Like you.

Well, yeah.
I mean--

177

I really like you too.

178
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,661
Then let's just
take it slow, okay?
Oh-oh, wait.

179
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,900
Uh--

I kind of don't know
what to say.

183
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,545
I kind of don't want you
to say anything.

I almost sealed the deal.

sorry about, uh--

I feel like
maybe I was being
a little judgmental.

190
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,074
You're good.
[ laughs ]
okay. Well, let's go.

No. You were right.
I should-- I'm gonna go.

00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,814
Yeah. I'm gonna go now.
We should take it slow.

193

You were right.
Really? Because I...

Don't need to now.

You called just
in the nick of time, buddy.
I was--

200

Looks like we got
a blown fuse in here.

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,508
Better get on that.
Blown fuses count
as charlie work.

That was, like, the best

mrs. Reynolds.

Like something
magical happened.
Hmm?

I was just saying that
that was, like, so special,

And, I mean,
it was like magic.

You're not gonna start

I got a better plan.

Okay. All right.
Uh, so can I
call you sometime?

214
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,498
I have your number, right?
No, I don't think so.

215
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,967
I know how to find you.
Why don't we leave it
at that?

216

Wh-- all right.
Did I do something wrong?

I mean, was the sex bad?

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,309
Don't worry about it.
[ whines ]
I can make adjustments--

'cause I've had to do
that before, and it
hasn't been a problem.

I'm shutting the door now.
Well, if I could just
have a kiss good-bye,

That would be...
Really great for me.

No, no, it's not gonna help.
I'll tell you why.

It doesn't "un-bang" your mom.

No, you gotta do
something worse--

Something much, much worse.

295
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,270
And I know that you know
that the sex was good, right?

296
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,305
So I think maybe we should--
<i>[ knocking ]</i>

297
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,608
[ whispering ]
there's somebody at the door.
I'm just gonna ignore it.

298
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,810
I think that maybe
we should get together--
<i>[ pounding ]</i>

299
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,513
Oh, they sound pissed.
All right, listen.
I'll give you a call back.

300
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,515
All right.

301
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,821
- let's go for a ride.
- why?

302
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,390
Grab your coat.
We're goin' for a ride.

303
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,260
- are you going to kill me?
- what?

304
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,596
No. I just wanna go out
and pick up some younger chicks,

305
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,099
And I need a wing man for that.
Come on. Let's roll.

306
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,402
 [ disco beat ]
[ frank ] how about the two
out there on the dance floor?

307
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,705
Go on.
Go on, break the ice.
Oh, come on, man.

308
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,873
Come on, man. Go. Go.
All right, all right.

309
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,044
Hey, how ya doin'?
I like your top.
Lookin' good. Mac.

310
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,847
Hi.
Hi. I'm frank.

311
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,850
Wanna get down? Huh?

312
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,457
What happened?
What did you do?

313
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,593
What are you talking
about, what did I do?
What was with that little move?

314
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,795
That move always works
with the ladies.

315
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,964
Frank, you have never gotten
a chick with that move.

316
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:43,035
What are you talkin' about?
That's how I got my wife.
Really?

317
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,204
Yeah. So don't go
blamin' the move.
The move works.

318
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,608
So, uh, what other kind
of things worked
on your wife?

319
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,712
- she likes money.
- so she likes money
and dancing.

320
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,115
Can we stop talking
about my wife
for a second here?

321
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,051
You're killin' the vibe.
Let me see now.

322
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,954
[ man singing ]
 go for it, go for it 
over there. Try the move.

323
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,990
You hang over here,
this side, while I--

324
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,192

[ chuckles ]

326
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,630
I'm frank. Remember?

327
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,299
 go, go for it 

328
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,136
 go for it

00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,972
 go for it, go for it 
 go for it, go for it 

330
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,509
 ooh 
where'd he go? Mac!

331
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,848
[ knocking ]
go away.

332
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,421
We need to talk.
Dee, now's not
a good time.

333
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,457
Charlie is making me
have sex with him
to get out of charlie work.

334
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,860
- what?
- yeah, I know.
Really gross.

335
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,197
Am I the only
one around here
who's not getting laid?

336
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:49,535
Dennis, charlie is forcing me
to have sex with him.

337
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,603
Mac's getting laid.
You're getting laid.

338
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,073
Now even charlie's getting laid?
This makes me look terrible.

339
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,642
Well, you know what?
This is all charlie's fault.

340
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,345
None of this would be happening
if dad didn't put him
in charge.

341
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,680
You're right.

342
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,651
I'm gonna kill him.
No, no. Whoa.

343
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:10,055
You ought to do
something worse than that--
something much, much worse.

344

[ doorbell rings ]

Oh! Hello, dennis.
Hello, mrs. Kelly.

Oh. Oh, my!
[ chuckles ]

348
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,641
Well, uh, it's good
to see you, dennis.

349
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,643
What brings you by?

350
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,979
I wanted to bring you
some chocolates.

351
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,383
Thank you.
Do you mind
if I come in?

352
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,385
Okay.

353
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,255
Oh, no.

354
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,491
That son of a bitch.

355
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,495
I know it.
No! No, he said
he loved me.

356
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,164
How dare he do that?

357
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,233
I'm gonna stab him.
Oh.

358
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,635
I'm gonna stab
his face off.
No. No, stabbing's bad.

359
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,837
You need to do
something worse--

360
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,974
Something much,
much worse.

361
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,076
You gotta sleep
with charlie.

I'm sorry, sweetie.

365
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,888
I just don't find you
sexually attractive.

366
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,924
Are you kidding me?
You don't find me
sexually attractive?

367
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,162
What in the hell is going on?
What is wrong
with you people?

00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,664
I am sexually a--

Listen, mac, let's just
end this right now.

373
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,983
I only slept with you
to piss frank off.

374
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,319
Afterward I felt like
I was gonna throw up.

375
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,823
So frank makes you
want to throw up?

376

No. You're not listening.

377
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,461
It's you that makes me
want to throw up.

378
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,632
Oh. So you don't want
to be my girlfriend anymore?

Wait a second.
Hold on.

Wait! I'm confused.
So you don't want to be
my girlfriend anymore?

- hey.
- oh, shit!

00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,626
No, mac, it's okay.
It's all right.

00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,762
Listen, uh--
okay, let me explain.

384
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,531
Just let me explain.
No, no.
I understand, okay?

385
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,568
You do?
Yeah. Look, I-- I think
I know how you're feeling.

Oh, man.
That is such a relief.

You've done well.

with the waitress
is all set up.

00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,590
Oh! Mmm!
That is so wonderful.
I have to ask you though--

393
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,427
How did you know that
your mom wasn't gonna
sleep with dennis?

00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,364
Hmm.

Guess I kind of
overlooked that detail.
Okay, time for phase three, dee.

396
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,337
No, charlie.
You said there were
only two phases.

397
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,572
This one's easy.

398

Okay. Phase three complete.
It looks good?

399

You look really good.
You sure?

00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,278
Yes.
You're all done?

401

You look great.

Thanks for helping me out.
You're welcome.

The waitress is gonna
be here soon.

404
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,453
I'm gonna go back to
bartending, and you will
go back to handling poo-poo.

405
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,688
Yeah, okay. Phase four--
no! No.

406

I got a quick phase four.
Charlie--

407
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,792
Let me squeak
a phase four in.
I won't-- you can't--

408
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,395
There's no squeaking
of phase-- no. No.
Okay, fine!

409
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,697
It's over. Okay?
Thank you.

You are hereby released
of all charlie work.

411

Hey, guys, uh,
can you do me a favor
and not get too drunk?

412
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:50,642
All right? 'cause I got
some kegs that I need
changing.

 I've still got what it takes

What the hell is she doing here?

420
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,094
"what the hell
is she doing here?"
really?

421
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,497
<i>Really.</i>
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>what I'm doing here.</i>

You wanna know
what I'm doing here,
shit-for-brains?

423
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,936
I had sex with your dad.

424
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,506
That's right,
I had sex with your father,

425
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:24,643
<i>Because, just like you,</i>
<i>I like my sex old</i>

on their heads that falls off
when you're having sex with 'em.

00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,651
It just falls off
because that's what
you do, dennis reynolds.

428
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,953
You like to have sex
with old people.

429
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,089
And you said
that you loved me!

430
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,693
You said, "I love you,"
and so I thought,
"okay, I love you too."

431
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,429
How do you show love?
You go and have sex
with old people.

432
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,864
So that's what I did too!
