1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,720
Okay, so, just to clarify

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:06,630
for the parole board once
again, you are claiming that

3
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:11,240
your father threatened to, quote,
"eat the living shit out of you".

4
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:16,700
That is correct.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,490
And Mr. Kelly, in your sworn
statement to police, you claim

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,016
that the prisoner told you that
if you didn't, and I quote,

7
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:28,144
"jam a bunch of stuff into
your butt," he was going to

8
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,730
"rape you so hard
the room would stink."

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,960
Then, he was going to, quote,

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,493
"eat your butt and his son's butt

11
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:43,008
in the stink until his
stomach was full of...

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,625
your butts."

13
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,570
- Is this correct?
- That is also correct.

14
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:51,500
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,023
Warden, they're lying.

16
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:55,020
I do not want to hurt them.

17
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:01,181
In fact, I want to get as far away
from those two as I possibly can.

18
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:02,209
Objection!

19
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,479
That's an objection, Your Honor.

20
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:04,270
Hey, he's lying to you!

21
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,536
Move to strike!

22
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:06,604
Move to strike!

23
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:08,833
Quiet! Sit down. Sit down!

24
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:10,021
He's lying!
He is lying!

25
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,617
Sit down... Get your hands
off the microphone.

26
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,123
Just leave it in the middle
of the two of you.

27
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:14,817
Leave it alone.

28
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:15,340
He said the middle, put it in
the middle.

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,584
Take your hands off the mic!

30
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,040
- Leave it alone.
- That's not the middle.

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,674
Leave it there.

32
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:21,824
Yes.

33
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:26,829
A few weeks ago, they came to
apologize for getting me arrested.

34
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,652
I did not accept their apology.

35
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:30,518
That never happened!

36
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:31,226
We were friends...

37
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:32,335
Shut up! Charlie, shut up!

38
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:33,246
Quiet! Quiet!

39
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,138
Quiet at the hearing!

40
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,616
<i>Oh, yeah, Dad?</i>

41
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:38,320
<i>Not going to accept our apology?</i>

42
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:39,195
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

43
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:40,384
<i>Plan B, bitch!</i>

44
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:41,683
<i>We're going to bury you.</i>

45
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:44,850
<i>Yeah, Mr. Mac, I'm going to
tell those parole board dickheads</i>

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,900
<i>that you said you were going to rape
my butt until the room stinks,</i>

47
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,403
<i>and then you're going to eat my butt
until your stomach is full of butt.</i>

48
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:54,005
<i>Full of my butt,
and full of Mac's butt.</i>

49
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,440
<i>You're not going to say it
exactly like that...</i>

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,661
<i>I'm going to say
something like that, yeah.</i>

51
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:58,495
<i>Sure? That's a lot of butts.</i>

52
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,787
<i>Yeah, I think all the butt
madness is really going to sell it.</i>

53
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,556
<i><u>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia
4x04-05 : "Mac and Charlie Die"</u></i>

54
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:11,461
Synchro and
corrections : Sososeries

55
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,809
Charlie, I'm telling you,
running away is not the answer.

56
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,718
Mac, we're going to need
supplies on the road, okay.

57
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:45,456
So just calm down, help me throw
some stuff into the stinking bindle.

58
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:47,759
Dude, no matter where we go,
my dad will find us,

59
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,196
and while I admit it would be
awesome to be hobos,

60
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:52,010
drifting from town to town,
solving mysteries,

61
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,872
I think we need to find
a real solution.

62
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,833
Oh, my God, how do hobos fit
all this stuff into a bandana?!

63
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,364
It doesn't make sense, man.

64
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,880
We're going to need, like, a towel or
a tablecloth or something, but...

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,003
It's not going to look cool.

66
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,386
We're going to look like assholes...

67
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,462
Wait a second. That's it! I got it!

68
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:04,898
I got it!

69
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,099
Forget the bindle.

70
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:09,222
The only way that
my dad is not going to kill us,

71
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,167
is if he thinks we're already dead.

72
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:11,582
Oh, great.

73
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:12,521
I was hoping you'd say that.

74
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,284
Great, let's kill ourselves.

75
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:14,388
Let's do it.

76
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,551
No. No, you didn't let
me finish. I don't...

77
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,293
It's no problem, dude.

78
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:16,950
I'm totally on board.

79
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,443
Okay, I'm going to grab a knife,
I'm going to jab it into your neck,

80
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,888
I'll yank it out. Then your blood's
going to start going everywhere.

81
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:22,357
No, buddy, listen.

82
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,696
And you'll die in five
to ten minutes,

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,830
and then depending on
how horrific that looks,

84
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:25,927
I'll probably do it myself, too.

85
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,530
Okay, listen, I was going to
say we fake our own death,

86
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,112
and then he thinks we're dead,
and he leaves us alone.

87
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:32,734
Yeah, right.
Either way works, dude.

88
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,188
Let's just pick one
before he gets here.

89
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,792
Let's pick the second one
where we don't actually die.

90
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,597
Calm down!
We'll pick the second one.

91
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:40,017
All right now, let's think.

92
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:41,808
We got to do it in some way
that's convincing, all right.

93
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,605
If we were going to kill ourselves,
it'd be awesome, right ?

94
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,034
Yeah, yeah. If we were
going to kill ourselves,

95
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,628
it would be with class, right,
I mean, because we're worth it.

96
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,932
Of course it would be with class!

97
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:51,720
What do you think, I'm not
going to die with class?

98
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,522
Maybe some type of explosion?

99
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:54,955
Of course there's going
to be an explosion.

100
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,292
You think I'm not going to explode?

101
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,913
I'm thinking, Charlie, it would be some
kind of blaze of glory for you, yes...

102
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,782
Of course it's going to be a
blaze of glory.

103
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:01,678
I'm going down right now.

104
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:03,737
No, no, no, okay, hold on
a second, okay, all right, so...

105
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,114
Did I miss something?

106
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,695
You're not getting this. I'll walk
you through the steps as we go.

107
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,181
First step: do not douse
yourself with lighter fluid.

108
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,934
- What is that?
- I don't know.

109
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you think it's for
watching somebody poop?

110
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:21,582
You think there's some perv
coming in here to watch me make?

111
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:22,736
What the hell are you
guys doing in here?

112
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:23,453
I got to go to the bathroom.

113
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,606
There's a hole in the wall. We're
just trying to figure out what it is.

114
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:30,556
Well, well, well, Deandra.

115
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:31,989
Would you look at that.

116
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:36,735
Frank, Dee, what you two have
discovered today

117
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:41,069
is what is most commonly
referred to... as a glory hole.

118
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:42,980
A glory hole?

119
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,616
A secret portal created
as a passage way

120
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,242
for one to safely
insert one's penis.

121
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,675
I'm sorry, a hole
to stick your dick in?

122
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,487
The partition acts
as a physical barrier,

123
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:55,896
thus ensuring anonymity throughout
the spontaneous act of copulation,

124
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,109
or fellatio, or at
the very least, a hand job.

125
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,189
What? Why?

126
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,209
Why would you want to have sex
with someone you can't see?

127
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,716
Well, Dee, I think
the real question is,

128
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,015
why wouldn't you want to have
sex with someone you can't see?

129
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,305
It's very European.

130
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,154
Europe leads the way in sexual
exploration, and quite frankly,

131
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,011
I think it's time we caught up.

132
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,913
This sounds hot.

133
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,486
I'm going to go get some duct tape.

134
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,235
Now, hold on
a second there, Frank.

135
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:22,945
Before you go sticking anything
through that hole,

136
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,372
you might want to consider that
on the other side of this wall,

137
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:27,737
more often than not,
there's a dude.

138
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,124
But you can't see through the wall,
so how do you know it's not a girl?

139
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,881
I mean, I could just picture
a girl, and then, it's good.

140
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,632
Right, well, some might find
that method effective,

141
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,286
but it's a dangerous game
you're playing, Frank.

142
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,770
Supposing the other guy is
picturing a girl, also.

143
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,569
How's he going to do that
with a dick in his mouth?

144
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,428
I don't know. That's his problem.

145
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,106
We're filling it in.

146
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:55,695
Okay, buddy, you ready?

147
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:57,975
Are you sure we have to do this?

148
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,479
Charlie, yes, we have to do this.

149
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,397
Look, if the cops are going to
identify the bodies,

150
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,994
we need to leave dental
records behind, right?

151
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:04,528
So we leave a couple of teeth,
bing, bam, boom.

152
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,795
I know. I feel like
it's going to hurt.

153
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,947
Yeah, it's going to hurt
like a bitch. Okay, ready?

154
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,812
One, two...

155
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,579
Wait. That just kind of
came out on its own.

156
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:14,964
Yeah, that slipped right out, huh?

157
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,149
I barely pulled that.
I barely pulled it.

158
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,872
What? Damn, dude!

159
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:20,611
That's another...

160
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:23,467
Man, you should really brush your
teeth more because that is not normal.

161
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:26,134
Oh, Charlie, stop pulling
your teeth out like that, man.

162
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:26,934
It's freaking me out.

163
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,517
They're just coming right out.
They, like, slip right out.

164
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,621
It's really freaking me out!

165
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,923
Oh, shit.

166
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,697
- You think it's my dad?
- Of course it's your dad.

167
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:34,685
Charlie, open up.

168
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,141
We got a dick hole in the bar.

169
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,489
I need you to come fill it in.

170
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:39,420
Okay, I got to go fill her
a dick hole, bro.

171
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:40,864
No, no, no, bro, come on.
We don't have time.

172
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,115
Okay, uh, audible.
Grab the camera.

173
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,294
Is Dee's car outside?

174
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,516
Uh... yes.

175
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,072
Okay, great. We'll steal it. We'll
use it as a part of blaze of glory.

176
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,042
Charlie, now you got to stop.

177
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:50,899
You really got to stop.
Just give it to me.

178
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,998
Give me all the teeth.
Okay, I got them in my pocket.

179
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,200
Huh? Hey! What the...

180
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,351
Okay, go, go, go!

181
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:04,541
Why would you do that?

182
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,396
Come on! Open the door!

183
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,923
Huh? I don't know.
It's all happening so fast, man!

184
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,050
You could've just opened it.

185
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh, that's true.

186
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,315
I'll fire you through that window.
All right, grab the...

187
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,890
Just go! Just go! Go, go, go!

188
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,752
The videotape is done.

189
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,009
My teeth are scattered
throughout the car,

190
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,365
and the will is in place.

191
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,504
Great.
Toss it out the window.

192
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,009
They'll think we did it
at the last minute.

193
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,218
Okay, got it.

194
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,442
Okay. What's next?

195
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,283
All right, I'm going to gun
this car as fast as it goes

196
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:39,901
directly into that wall.

197
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,005
Now, judging by the distance,
I'm thinking I could get it up

198
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,842
to about 60, 70 miles an hour.

199
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:44,725
Oh, definitely, definitely.

200
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,060
At the last possible second,

201
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,601
I'm thinking maybe
three feet from the wall...

202
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:51,736
We jump out to safety, the car
explodes in a hot ball of fury

203
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,346
and we're dead to the world.

204
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,190
Okey dokey.

205
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,370
Good luck with that.

206
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:56,645
Wait. Where you going, dude?

207
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,596
Well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
watch you do it.

208
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,287
No, we need to do it together.

209
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,217
- But I'm not really doing anything.
- Yes, you are, Charlie.

210
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,097
You're here for moral support.

211
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,032
But if no one's actually
seeing us jump out of the car...

212
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,683
Well, it's... we're gonna
kill ourselves together.

213
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:08,329
There's no real...

214
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,611
Get out, get out, get out.

215
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,444
I'll do it myself.

216
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,295
The whole thing's gonna be
better without me anyway, Mac.

217
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm telling you, it's gonna be
great without me.

218
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:14,779
All right, buddy, good luck!

219
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:16,733
Pussy.

220
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,841
Holy shit, dude, are you all
right?

221
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,067
Why didn't you jump out?

222
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,573
- I'm okay, I'm okay, Charlie.
- Holly shit!

223
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,258
Dude, oh, my God!

224
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,428
I guess I was just going too fast.

225
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,588
I was going too fast.

226
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,568
Oh, my God.

227
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,912
All right, let's get out of here.

228
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:40,927
We're gonna have to burn the car.

229
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,350
Let's do it.

230
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:42,571
We'll have to get some gasoline.

231
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,851
Holy shit!

232
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,066
We're not gonna find something
to burn the car at a pawnshop.

233
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:54,772
Are you kidding me?

234
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,387
You can find amazing things
in pawnshops.

235
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,343
This is the perfect...

236
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,600
Should've gone to a gas
station, dude,

237
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,103
and buy some gasoline
to burn the car.

238
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:02,161
I know, but we've been talking
about this the whole walk over.

239
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:03,590
You can't go to a gas station.

240
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:04,737
There's too many cameras.

241
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,449
Bro, like, I say something,
and then you, like,

242
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:08,874
forget it two seconds later, okay?

243
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,903
Are you sure you're all right?

244
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:10,737
Your ear's bleeding a ton.

245
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,254
I'm fine.

246
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:12,886
I feel like $1 million.

247
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,153
All right, well,
you don't seem like...

248
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,001
Well, then, focus,
Mr. Million Dollars,

249
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,833
and let's find something
to blow up a car.

250
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,608
Oh, Charlie!

251
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,500
Look at that wedding dress, dude.

252
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,186
That's sad.

253
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:26,682
Okay, that is not gonna blow
a car up, okay?

254
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,923
So, can you focus?

255
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,358
Will you please find a way to
focus?

256
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,329
Oh, shit, look at this, dude!

257
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,938
Now we're talking.

258
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,491
Damn, they sell guns here?

259
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:37,777
They sell everything here.

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,126
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

261
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,010
Pawnshops are like
international waters.

262
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,992
People come in, and they just
trade stuff, you know what I mean ?

263
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,030
Anything goes here.

264
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,694
We can get whatever
we want, all right?

265
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:47,402
Let's pick this bad boy up.

266
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,705
Shit, that's awesome.
All right, good.

267
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,118
So you're sure we'll have enough money
for this and the wedding dress, right ?

268
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,372
'Cause that is a great gun.

269
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,108
We're not buying
the wedding dress.

270
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,292
Yeah, we're buying
the wedding dress.

271
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:58,982
Are you crazy?

272
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,006
We can't just leave it here.

273
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:00,994
We absolutely can leave it here.

274
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,224
It's not gonna help us
in any way, shape or form.

275
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:02,921
That's crazy.

276
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,314
Bro, okay, you know what?

277
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,414
That car wreck, it scrambled
your circuits, all right?

278
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:07,073
You're losing your mind.

279
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:08,676
So, will you just
let me handle it?

280
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:09,906
I got Dee's purse.

281
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:10,936
We got her credit cards in here.

282
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:11,876
We have plenty of money.

283
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:12,825
I know what I'm doing.

284
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,481
And stop talking about
the wedding dress.

285
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,056
All right.

286
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:17,491
Sir, excuse me, sir.

287
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:23,186
Hi, we are in desperate need
of something that will destroy

288
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,897
a car and, uh, annihilate any
traces of a human being.

289
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:29,807
Let me see what I got.

290
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:31,655
All right, you see that?

291
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,690
Your old buddy here knows
what he's doing every now and then.

292
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,051
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

293
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:43,948
Well, this is an interesting turn.

294
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,310
I'm assuming this is
a live grenade, yes?

295
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,006
Oh, yeah.

296
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:49,245
Well, then, we'll take it.

297
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:51,623
Was the wedding in Philadelphia?

298
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,104
I don't know.

299
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:53,295
I don't care about the wedding.

300
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,051
Sir, do you have anything that
might get my buddy's head straight?

301
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,119
He's losing his mind.

302
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,103
Got some poppers in the back.

303
00:10:59,326 --> 00:10:59,904
All right.

304
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:01,242
There we go.

305
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,137
All right, Luther, today's the day.

306
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,171
You got any plans for the outside?

307
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,974
Yeah, I got some plans.

308
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,399
I got some big plans.

309
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:30,762
I'm gonna throw
this grenade into the car.

310
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,314
The car will explode, and
our problems will be solved.

311
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:35,423
In the meantime,
I need you to do a popper.

312
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,568
Okay, I understand the plan.

313
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,581
Except for when we find the bride.

314
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,473
Don't even start, man.

315
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:42,717
- That's a very important part
- You've been talking crazy

316
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,328
- of my plan.
- for way too long,

317
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,784
so just take
a deep breath of this.

318
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,569
Inhale.

319
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:48,708
There we go.

320
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:50,099
Grenade.

321
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,869
Gonna throw it in the car.

322
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:52,860
- Yeah, let's do it.
- You and me?

323
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:53,294
I'm back.

324
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:54,554
Let's not talk about
the dress anymore.

325
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:55,212
Okay, here we go.

326
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:56,562
No dress, grenade.

327
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:58,065
Go, move!

328
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,121
Go, go, go, go!

329
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:02,936
This is gonna be awesome,
dude.

330
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:03,582
It's gonna be huge.

331
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:11,181
That's it?

332
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:11,829
Weird.

333
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,504
- That was totally lame.
- That's what grenades do?

334
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,618
- It was a very old grenade.
- What a gyp.

335
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,713
I thought it was gonna be so
much more awesome than that.

336
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:19,746
The car's not even on fire.

337
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:20,674
All right, plan B.

338
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,478
Gun, gas tank.

339
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:23,703
I'm gonna fire directly into it.

340
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,019
- The car's gonna go up.
- Now you're thinking.

341
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:25,665
- Yeah?
- Go, baby.

342
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:26,322
Ready?

343
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,284
You're gonna waste all the
bullets.

344
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,318
You got to get a lot closer.

345
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:33,963
Closer?

346
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:36,854
No, you got to stay far away
cause it's gonna blow up, dude.

347
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,130
Chickenshit, I'll walk right
up to that thing and shoot.

348
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:39,761
No, you can't walk right up
to it and shoot.

349
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:40,744
It'll blow you to safety.

350
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,073
All right, how about this?

351
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:44,048
Popper... put it to my nose.

352
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,363
- We'll walk up, and I'll just be...
- That will help you focus.

353
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:48,494
Okay, well, let's just...

354
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:49,910
That's at least
the smart thing to do.

355
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,368
Okay, hold on, I'm stepping on
this dress.

356
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,199
One, two...

357
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:54,578
Go.

358
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:59,251
- Ah, God damn it, dude!
- No more bullets.

359
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,012
Grenades and bullets
don't burn cars?

360
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,304
All right, dude, new plan.

361
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,057
The teeth, the envelope, the crash.
I think it's enough, you know?

362
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,737
You think that's enough?

363
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,839
Maybe the cops will think
we just, like, I don't know...

364
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:09,002
disintegrated?

365
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:10,058
All right, fine.

366
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:12,242
Then, we'll get these credit cards,
we'll buy some camping equipment.

367
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,546
We'll go up to the roof,
and we'll lay low.

368
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,052
See, there's my boy.
He's making plans again.

369
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:16,368
- He's thinking.
- He's back!

370
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,927
He's also wearing a wedding dress,
though, and I'd like him to take it off.

371
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,373
Oh, yeah, this is outrageous.

372
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,289
That's completely crazy, man.

373
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:27,800
This is it.

374
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,329
Uh, I'm starting to have
second thoughts about

375
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:31,709
this sex party thing, Frank.

376
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,067
Dennis, what, are you having
second thoughts about the glory hole?

377
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,227
And now you're gonna be skittish
about the sex party?

378
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,849
Don't...

379
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,608
You said you wanted
to have anonymous sex.

380
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:41,849
This is the place.

381
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,908
I do want to have anonymous sex.
I want to have anonymous sex.

382
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,464
I want to have a sex party.
I want it all.

383
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:46,708
I want the glory hole.
I want all those things.

384
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,131
Here it is.

385
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:49,116
What I'm having a hard time
believing, though, Frank,

386
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:52,368
is that there is an elite secret
sex society behind that door,

387
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,184
in this building.

388
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,752
I used to run with this crew.

389
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:57,749
These people are the most
powerful, influential,

390
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,853
sexiest people in Philadelphia.

391
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,563
Well, then, why are they having
a goddamn orgy in such a dump then?

392
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,040
I thought this kind of thing went down
in, like, somebody's elegant mansion.

393
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,055
I was looking forward to that.

394
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,965
No, nobody's gonna have
an orgy in their mansion.

395
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,905
All over their nice furniture?
I mean, that doesn't make sense.

396
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,816
Well, no, it doesn't.
That's a really good point.

397
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:14,380
All right, let's do it.

398
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,725
Yeah, all right, put your mask on,
and don't embarrass me.

399
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:18,533
All right.
Don't embarrass yourself.

400
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:28,246
What is the password?

401
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,666
Orgy...

402
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,711
You may enter.

403
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:42,811
Orgy?
Seriously?

404
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:52,647
What the hell is this place?
What did you bring me to?

405
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,410
This is a buffet.

406
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,509
Well, I can see that it's a
buffet, but why is there a buffet

407
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,149
at a goddamn orgy, Frank?

408
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,388
You don't want to bang on
an empty stomach, do you?

409
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:01,041
I don't want to bang any of
these people anyway.

410
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,920
They're all paunchy
and weird and old.

411
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,624
You can't tell under the masks.

412
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:05,931
I can absolutely tell.

413
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,517
And why are our costumes so much
more elaborate than everybody

414
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,278
else's like they didn't put
any effort into it?

415
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:12,641
Ah, Jesus Christ, that guy's
not even wearing a mask.

416
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:15,335
He's got the right idea.

417
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:17,852
This beak is interfering
with my nosh.

418
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,026
What are you doing?
Don't take it off.

419
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,431
Ah, Jesus,
what are we doing here, man?

420
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,577
How is this even an orgy?
Nobody's having sex.

421
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:23,983
What did you bring me to?

422
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,048
You brought me...
what is this, like...

423
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,995
It's like a half nude buffet party.

424
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,858
Oh, it's not exactly what I thought
it was gonna be, either, but it's okay.

425
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:30,592
There's a lot of food.

426
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:33,195
Frank, I think we can both
agree this is not the kind of

427
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:34,608
anonymous sex that
we're looking for, right?

428
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,196
You want to go down by the bridge?

429
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,025
What in God's name could
possibly be down by the bridge?

430
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,563
I don't know.
It could be cool.

431
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,054
It could be cool?

432
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:44,449
No, Frank, I don't want to go
down by the bridge.

433
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,682
You know what,
I'm going back to the bar.

434
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:46,938
I'm gonna go back
to the glory hole.

435
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,805
That's something that I feel like
I could wrap my head around.

436
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:49,842
This is ridiculous.

437
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,977
You think these are fresh
shrimp or frozen shrimp?

438
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,197
I don't care!

439
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,343
What is this place?
These are not...

440
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,469
Who are these people?

441
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:58,455
It's like a bad acid trip in here.

442
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,016
I'm coming.
I'm gonna come.

443
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,248
Now, what if I just slip my
foot over like this, as if to say,

444
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,694
"Hello, I'd like to have
some anonymous sex please."

445
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:14,977
All right, I'm into that.

446
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,514
Then, I wait for the signal back.

447
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:20,126
If it's a lady's foot,
I'm in the clear!

448
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,441
But, Frank, here's
my problem with that.

449
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:22,774
A man can wear a woman's shoe.

450
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,966
You can't rule out trickery.

451
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,386
I mean that's why we need
the viewing slot.

452
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,469
The slot defeats the purpose.

453
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,618
I could see your eyes.
We might as well get married!

454
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,222
It's the safest way, Frank.

455
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,463
Dennis, if I was looking for safe,

456
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,551
I wouldn't be sticking
my dick through a wall.

457
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:39,348
You guys, get out here right now.

458
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,486
You need to take a look at this.

459
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:43,661
Good news, Dee, we made
the bathroom unisex.

460
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:45,428
Glory hole's up and running, baby.

461
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,517
I don't care about that.

462
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,582
According to
the Philadelphia Police Department,

463
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,014
Mac and Charlie are dead.

464
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,934
You got the camera, man?

465
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:54,943
- Yeah, is it ready?
- Yeah I think so.

466
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:55,777
We good, are we on?

467
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,641
Dennis and Frank, if you're watching
this, then we're already dead.

468
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:00,738
Our lives were horrible.

469
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,062
Horrible and sad,
so we decided to end it all.

470
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,848
Not me actually, my life
was pretty sweet.

471
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,540
But Charlie and I had a suicide pact,
and I have to honor that

472
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,296
because I am honorable man.

473
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,414
I will die an honorable man.

474
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,784
There's also a will enclosed and
you totally have to do all of that

475
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,852
because that's like a law.

476
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,937
Okay, wait a second.
My life was also very honorable.

477
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,547
Here we go!

478
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,001
I can't believe they're dead.

479
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:30,461
I can't believe they didn't
include me in their suicide pact.

480
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:30,975
What?

481
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:32,277
Are you crazy?

482
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,671
They're not dead, they're
definitely doing something stupid,

483
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,004
- but they're not dead.
- You saw the tape, Dee!

484
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,241
My best friends
went on a blaze of glory

485
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,570
and they didn't even ask me
to be part of it.

486
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,257
This is terrible!

487
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:41,474
Are you buying this?

488
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:44,831
That is ridiculous, Dennis,
they left us a list of demands.

489
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:46,808
What are you talking about?

490
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,797
That's their last will and
testament. That is not demands.

491
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,493
It says at the top :
"List of demands."

492
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,661
Well, whatever, it's their wishes
and we have to honor them.

493
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,595
Oh, we do? Oh we do,
we have to honor them?

494
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,638
Okay, let's see, Frank.

495
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:02,328
Charlie's number one : my ashes
are to be made into a tea and

496
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:04,601
to be dranken by everyone in bar.

497
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:05,580
Done!

498
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:07,283
Damn it, gross, fine, what else?

499
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:08,836
Mac's number one.

500
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,140
In lieu of a body, which was
most likely blown up

501
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,783
in the most awesome way imaginable,
I would like the duster to be burned

502
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:17,856
and its ashes buried in an unmarked
grave somewhere by the river.

503
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:18,793
Well, that's crazy.

504
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,068
I'm not gonna burn
or bury the duster.

505
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,593
Yeah, we also both have to name
our first born child Murphy

506
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:26,009
because that was Robocop's name.

507
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,577
Goddamn it!

508
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,268
Mac is dead and
he's still bossing me around.

509
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,383
Mac is not dead, Dennis.

510
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,906
How could you be so cold?

511
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,283
They blew up my car!

512
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,740
Not burning the duster.

513
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:36,227
- You're still talking about a coat?
- Absolutely!

514
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,224
That is an automobile.

515
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:40,270
<i>- It's a piece of clothing!
- They're people!</i>

516
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,929
<i>- They're all lying!
- They're lying people!</i>

517
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,194
Jesus, man, they must be
really broken up.

518
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,562
We can hear 'em from up here.

519
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:47,940
They're like crying
and whing and...

520
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:49,752
I'm excited about the hot dogs.

521
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,282
- Oh, crap!
- What?

522
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,038
We should've got beans, dude.

523
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:54,933
Hobos are always eating beans.

524
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:55,654
Damn.

525
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:56,873
We'll be fine without
the beans, all right,

526
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,371
cause this is a perfect,
perfect hiding spot.

527
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,069
This would be better
with beans though.

528
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:02,313
Leave it alone with the beans.

529
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,011
No! Stop it! Don't do it.

530
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:07,746
Oh, my God.

531
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,879
How? How is that possible?

532
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:10,757
I don't know.

533
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,330
Just put it down.

534
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:13,381
You think they're my baby teeth?

535
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:14,487
Put it with the other ones.

536
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:18,880
You're not gonna be able to
eat this hot dog.

537
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:19,769
I'll suck it down.

538
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,654
<i>I asked you to leave me be.</i>

539
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:31,456
<i>I asked you to let me live my life.</i>

540
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,679
<i>But you wouldn't go away.</i>

541
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,071
<i>You kept pushing, and pushing,</i>

542
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:44,342
<i>until you forced me
to do something drastic...</i>

543
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:50,155
<i>Something I was hoping
I would never have to do...</i>

544
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,403
Well, I guess this is probably,
this is probably gonna be it

545
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,257
so we should,
we should get started.

546
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:08,481
What to say about Mac.

547
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,469
He certainly was...

548
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:16,018
angry.

549
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,746
- Burn the duster!
- I'm not burning the duster!

550
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:20,613
Okay, I'm not burning the duster.

551
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,613
All right, that's crazy.
That's like, that's insane.

552
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,822
Why would I ever burn,
I mean, come on.

553
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:28,983
I will continue to wear it,
in his honor.

554
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,543
And I will burn some other things.
You know maybe like these,

555
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,464
stupid goddamn sleeveless t-shirts

556
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,775
that he wants retired
and hung up in the bar.

557
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,816
I'll burn these. But I am not
burning the duster, okay?

558
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:40,953
So forget it. It probably
won't even burn anyway.

559
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,352
It's not supposed to...
it's flame-retardant.

560
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:43,369
That's like the whole point.

561
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,525
It's like a shield of armor, so stop
asking me to burn the duster.

562
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,023
I'm not gonna burn it!

563
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:56,770
So, end of story, you know.
Let's just move on.

564
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,790
So...

565
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,089
Yeah, all right.

566
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,556
Well, uh, thank you.

567
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:14,838
Come on.

568
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:15,719
No.

569
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,005
- I'm not doing it.
- Come on.

570
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:20,518
Deandra, get on that stage.

571
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:26,321
Before, uh, Mac and Charlie died
they made a slideshow.

572
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:30,332
And, uh, we're going to play
a song that was a favorite of theirs.

573
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:31,651
Go ahead.

574
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:35,176
<i>It's all the same</i>

575
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:39,613
<i>Only the names have changed</i>

576
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,295
<i>Every day, it seems we're
wasting away</i>

577
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,432
<i>Another place,</i>

578
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:52,521
<i>where the faces are so cold</i>

579
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:55,452
<i>I'd drive all night,</i>

580
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:58,714
<i>just to get back home</i>

581
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,119
<i>I'm a cowboy,</i>

582
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:05,496
<i>on a steel horse I ride</i>

583
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:10,144
<i>I'm wanted, dead or alive...</i>

584
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:11,897
I miss you, Charlie.

585
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,867
This is bullshit, dude.

586
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,431
No one's mourning me properly.

587
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,577
What are you talking about, man?
Your mom's sitting right there.

588
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,847
She's mourning you.

589
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:23,222
Yeah, she watched an entire episode
of Mama's Familyand fell asleep.

590
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:26,864
And now, I'm going to give
them the one gun salute.

591
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,077
No, you're not!

592
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:30,625
All right. Oh, my God!
Let go!

593
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:34,255
Wow, that was great
and very touching.

594
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:36,890
Thanks so much for coming,
both of you.

595
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:38,379
Time to go.

596
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:40,094
See you at the next one.

597
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:44,133
Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie, aww,
it's going to be okay.

598
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:47,249
I'll tell you what, why don't
you go into the bathroom,

599
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,700
go into the center stall,
I got a little surprise for you.

600
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,372
It's going to cheer you up.

601
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,542
That's okay, Frankie.
I don't need to go potty.

602
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,027
Oh, damn it.

603
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:05,397
Can you believe it, sis?
They're actually gone.

604
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:08,089
- This changes everything.
- I need a ride home.

605
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:10,579
No, no, no.
Can't do that, sis.

606
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,949
I got to get back home ASAP and
meet a couple potential new roommates.

607
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,564
Hot ones!
You know what I'm saying?

608
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:17,936
All right, hey,
it's time to move on.

609
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:34,117
Would you mind not breathing
directly into my mouth?

610
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:38,398
No thoughts on that?

611
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,919
You're not going to say anything?
You're just going to stare at me?

612
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,343
That's what you're bringing
to the table? That's great.

613
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,405
I'm gonna... could you excuse me?

614
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:50,077
Excuse me.

615
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,290
Sir... Goddamn.

616
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,890
Thanks, I'm just gonna...

617
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:00,942
Excuse me.

618
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,787
No, of course, let me do it.

619
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:07,538
Thanks.

620
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,029
Hi.

621
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:11,976
Oh, my God, freak show back there.

622
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,133
Ma'am, I'm going to need for you
to step behind the line.

623
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:19,128
Yeah, look, as you can probably tell,
I'm not really a bus person.

624
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:22,291
It's just, a couple of dicks
destroyed my car and then forced me

625
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:25,403
to lower myself to this, so if you could
just cut me some slack, because...

626
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:28,256
I don't know if you've been
back there, but animals.

627
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,673
You're touching me. That doesn't...
this isn't weird for you?

628
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:33,636
Ma'am, either you get behind
the line or your ride ends here.

629
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,663
- I'm behind the line.
- You're on the line.

630
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,617
On the line, behind the line,
who cares?!

631
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,064
That's it.
I'm pulling the bus over.

632
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:42,292
No, goddamn it, don't pull
the bus over, all right?

633
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,340
Really?!

634
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,055
Okay, fine, you know what?

635
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:48,190
I will go back behind the line with
the rest of the filthy degenerates.

636
00:24:48,273 --> 00:24:49,902
But I am not happy about it, lady.

637
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,670
Excuse me!

638
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,618
Oh, my... really?

639
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,634
Oh, my God.

640
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,683
Oh, no, you stay put. I'll get it.

641
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,185
On the floor of a bus...

642
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,040
On the floor of a filthy bus.

643
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,814
Excuse me for just a sec!

644
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:03,504
Damn it, dude.

645
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,990
I can't believe Dee finally caught on
and cancelled her credit cards.

646
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,999
This is really not good, dude.
Now we don't have any beans.

647
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,288
We don't have any beer, dude.
We're shit out of luck, bro.

648
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:11,488
All right, I'll tell you what.
We'll get back to the bar.

649
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:13,313
We'll get some beer there,
at least we'll have that.

650
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:14,158
Not a bad idea.

651
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,163
In the meantime,
I need a popper, all right.

652
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,162
I got to get my head straight.

653
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:18,591
I got a little bad news
on the popper front.

654
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:20,273
- This is the last one, dude.
- Shit! Really?

655
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,806
All right, well,
I think I should get it.

656
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,771
- Not going to have it.
- Can I just have it?

657
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,054
- Bro?
- Can I just have it?

658
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:30,746
- Will you let me do the poppers?
- I just want it.

659
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,414
- I just need it, dude.
- The poppers person.

660
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,510
Give me the popper, dude!
I need that popper, bro!

661
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:39,519
I got to have the popper!

662
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:45,187
Oh, you son of a bitches!

663
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,419
Hey, look out.
Look out!

664
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,593
Hey, you jerks!

665
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,743
Goddamn it!

666
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:56,864
Hey! No, stop the bus!
Stop the bus!

667
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:58,221
Shut up!

668
00:25:58,304 --> 00:25:59,301
You shut up, bitch!

669
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:00,865
Stop the bus!

670
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,480
Sir? Sir, I just... I need to pull
the cord to get off the bus.

671
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,093
This is my stop.
You're in my way.

672
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,506
Can you get out of the way
so I can pull the cord?

673
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:10,170
I'll get out of your way as soon
as I get off...

674
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,691
Oh, my God, what is
wrong with you?

675
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,487
Goddamn it, you bitches!

676
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,462
Good-bye, Mac's shit.

677
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,002
Good-bye, Mac's shit.
Good-bye, Mac's shit.

678
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,341
Good-bye... come on, dude.

679
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:41,335
When were you ever going to use
nunchakus? Are you kidding me?

680
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:46,537
Yeah, hang on one second.

681
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:52,355
Yeah, it's perfect.

682
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:54,962
Hello.

683
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:57,253
Uh, hi.
Um, can I help you?

684
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,664
You're
looking for a roommate, right?

685
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:03,574
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was looking
for two, actually. Female.

686
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:06,239
I believe I was pretty clear
in the ad here.

687
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:09,444
"Male, 30, looking for
Three's Company type deal.

688
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,898
Did Odd Couplething for past decade,
looking for something new."

689
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:13,894
Yeah, I did the Three's
Company thing once.

690
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:17,017
It was pretty cool for like a week,
and then I banged one of them.

691
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,316
- Oh... nice.
- Not nice.

692
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,219
Do you know what this is like?
Banging the chicks that you live with?

693
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:23,390
It's terrible, man.

694
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:25,753
Every day you have to deal
with this.

695
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:28,887
Get out, lady.

696
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:32,188
Wow, yeah, I guess I never
really thought about that before.

697
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:35,496
You know, you're... you're much
smarter than my old roommate.

698
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:38,230
Yeah, look, I'm going to be
upfront with you.

699
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:40,720
I run with a pretty wild crew.

700
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:44,462
There's probably going to be chicks
over here, like, all the time.

701
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,616
I'm into some pretty crazy shit.

702
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:50,772
Here's the best part: I don't
even know most of their names.

703
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,834
Oh, yes! It's like...

704
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:57,288
You know, I've been trying to get
into the anonymous sex thing lately.

705
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,789
- Oh, yeah?
- Now, are you, uh, European?

706
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,965
Oh, I'm sorry.
What gave it away?

707
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:08,242
Nice. Yeah, well, you know,
I could probably consider, like,

708
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,333
a, uh,Perfect Strangers type
of deal.

709
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:14,354
Look, I like this by the way.
This is a sweet duster.

710
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:25,121
First, he doesn't burn the duster, and
now he's looking for new roommates?

711
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,199
Why did you want to burn that
duster anyway?

712
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,828
Because he always wears it with
no shirt and a shitload of cologne.

713
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:30,886
It's totally ruined.

714
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,321
- Hello, bitches!
- Jesus Christ, Dee!

715
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,487
You scared the shit out of me.
I almost dropped all my beer.

716
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,754
I knew you two weren't dead.

717
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,465
What are you doing popping
out of our tent? Not cool, Dee!

718
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,734
Oh, not cool? Oh, I'll tell you
what's not cool.

719
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:45,455
Crashing my car into a building,
exploding a grenade inside of it

720
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,214
and then convincing your friends
your family that you're dead.

721
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:51,104
That's one of the cooler
things you could ever do.

722
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:52,409
That's really unbelievably
cool.

723
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,545
- I suggest you try it...
- Cooler than I thought it was.

724
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:55,801
I don't know why
you're up here doing

725
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:57,116
whatever it is that you're doing,
and I don't care.

726
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:59,751
What I do care about,
is my 1997 Dodge Neon.

727
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:00,798
So here's the deal.

728
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:04,331
You two monkeys are going to get
me a new 1997 Dodge Neon,

729
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:07,007
or I'm going to go and tell Frank and
Dennis that you faked your own deaths

730
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,488
and you're hiding up on the roof.

731
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:13,111
Well, now you're just talking crazy.
You can't buy a new 1997 Dodge Neon.

732
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:15,319
- You can buy an old one...
- Okay, new to me.

733
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,982
Dee, you got bigger problems,
because my dad just got out of jail,

734
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:19,858
and he's coming to kill you.

735
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,332
What?!
Me?

736
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:22,228
Are you sure?

737
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,060
Kill you, kill us,
kill everybody really.

738
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:25,004
He's going to kill everyone.

739
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,430
Why would you not tell me
this news earlier?

740
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,921
Oh, my God, get off our case,
Dee, all right? What's done is done.

741
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,731
Look, Mac and I are hobo
drifters now, okay?

742
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,328
We don't dwell on the past.

743
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:35,099
No, hobo drifters
live in the present.

744
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:37,281
So look, if you really want
to get back at Frank and Dennis,

745
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,702
you got to fake your own death.

746
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,477
I don't want to get back
at Frank and Dennis.

747
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,960
I want to get at you two.

748
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:43,794
Really is that what...?

749
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,333
What? Is that what
your plan was?

750
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,831
I tuned out during
the whole tirade.

751
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:49,296
She said the 1997 Dodge Neon
thing and I totally lost her.

752
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:51,614
All right, Dee, I'll tell you
what, here's the plan.

753
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:53,644
Why don't you fake your own
death like us?

754
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,262
It really is the only thing you can do
now 'cause you're in this too deep.

755
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:57,215
Look, you want to die?

756
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,111
Now... what's your bean situation?

757
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,436
You got some beans on you,
or what's up?

758
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:16,384
Good-bye, son.

759
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,517
Aw, man, I got to tell you,
this is awesome.

760
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:36,096
It's making me forget
that Mac ever even died.

761
00:30:36,283 --> 00:30:37,915
Oh, yeah, just relax,
roommate.

762
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,382
I'm going to relax.

763
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:41,531
I'm going to relax all over
the place in a second.

764
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,371
Shit. Jan?

765
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:47,953
All right, I got to get this.

766
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,377
Hey, Dennis.

767
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,417
Really? What do you want?

768
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,843
Hey, I just wanted to let you
know I was going to go for

769
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,604
a quick jog in Fairmont Park
by myself.

770
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,989
Oh, yeah? Great.
Okay, have fun.

771
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:57,917
But, it's kind of dangerous.

772
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:58,839
Yeah, I got it, Dee.

773
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,822
- I don't know if you noticed...
- Go jogging! Ang go !

774
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:01,915
What's this have to do with me?

775
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:05,163
Just me out there in the middle of
the night in the dark by myself. Really?

776
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,504
Sorry about her, I...

777
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:10,042
She was a bag... I hate her.

778
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:15,510
Which one do you want first?
Huh, Greta or Sasha?

779
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,225
Oh, no. No, shit, bro.
Why'd you do that, bro?

780
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,154
Come here, man.

781
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:20,561
- What did I do?
- You said their names.

782
00:31:20,984 --> 00:31:22,557
Come on, man,
that kills it for me.

783
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,953
Look, bro,
can I be honest with you?

784
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:27,785
This is great and all, but I was
really hoping for more of like a,

785
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:31,815
you know, anything goes, crazy
European sex party kind of a thing.

786
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:33,800
- Something a little kinkier.
- Kinky ?

787
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,738
Oh, kinky. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I like this.

788
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:38,788
You like this, we like this.

789
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,290
Yeah, let me make some calls.

790
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:43,974
Do you think you could put
something like that together?

791
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,918
Of course I can, man.
I'm European.

792
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:48,128
Oh! That's...

793
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,449
It looks like he's got
a lot of new friends.

794
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:56,835
Yes, I can see that, Charlie.

795
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:57,931
Some of them
are really pretty girls.

796
00:31:58,098 --> 00:31:58,675
Yes, they are very pretty.

797
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,595
Wow, that's tough, man.
That's a tough thing to see.

798
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:02,391
Shut up, dude.

799
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:04,316
I'll bet you Frank
is throwing a party, too.

800
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:08,038
It's your turn to take
the bedpan out tonight.

801
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:11,897
"Little freak!
I did it last time!"

802
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,759
No, Charlie, I got up in
the middle of the night,

803
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:17,736
and I walked down
the hallway with the bedpan.

804
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:22,729
"All right, Frank, I'll do it,
only because I like you so much".

805
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:29,903
I like you, too, Charlie.
I like you, too, New Charlie.

806
00:32:34,824 --> 00:32:37,055
You know what, man?
I'm kicking it up a notch.

807
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,387
- We're haunting these bitches.
- Haunting's cool, man.

808
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,969
- Coming back from the grave, bitch.
- All right, that's cool.

809
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:44,215
What is this? What are you doing,
like Poltergeistor something?

810
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,337
- Awesome, right?
- No, no.

811
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,548
Craig T. Nelson.

812
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,679
Craig T. Nelson is the best,
dude, but Poltergeist?

813
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,778
- What ?
- It's not scary.

814
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:52,884
It's all about psychological damage.

815
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,058
Big deal, look at me.

816
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,089
Psychological damage up to here.

817
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:57,545
It doesn't do anything for me,
you know?

818
00:32:57,628 --> 00:33:00,084
Physical damage, that's what's
gonna irritate people.

819
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,118
All right, what do you
suggest?

820
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,013
Well, I mean, if anything, maybe
we tie some knives to our fingers

821
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,214
and we get a little more serious
about this whole murder thing.

822
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:07,587
- Haunting.
- Haunting!

823
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,588
- We're gonna haunt them.
- I'm sorry, I was thinking...

824
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,620
Oh, my God, I'm so happy to
see you.

825
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,472
Oh, God, I had the weirdest night.
It was crazy.

826
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,903
As soon as I left Dennis's place,
I realized I don't have a car,

827
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,205
right, so I actually do
have to run home by myself

828
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,472
through the park in the middle
of the night.

829
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:22,980
So I'm on Spring Garden Street,
and this big car full of gangbangers...

830
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:24,781
Okay, gangbangers.
That is an awesome story, Dee.

831
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,850
That's the end of it, right?
That could be the end of the story?

832
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:28,416
Charlie and I are right in
the middle of something.

833
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:29,786
Check it out, we're gonna
put some knives on our fingers

834
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:30,681
and start murdering people.

835
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:31,790
- Haunting people.
- Haunting.

836
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,655
- We're gonna haunt people.
- Whatever.

837
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,015
You're gonna do like a
Poltergeistthing?

838
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:36,924
- That's Dennis.
- That's Dennis.

839
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,067
Hey, ladies, like I said,
pop them off.

840
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,747
Start popping them off.

841
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,811
Oh, I love it, I love it.
Hey, feel free to be free.

842
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,232
No American judgments here. The only
rule is: don't tell me your names.

843
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,623
I don't want to know your names,
okay?

844
00:33:56,706 --> 00:34:00,302
"Hi, I'm Charlie.
Frankie, I love these girls."

845
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:02,372
Frank, what are you doing, man ?

846
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:04,881
You're freaking the girls out
with this mannequin. Get rid of it.

847
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:09,580
Dennis, these girls are German.
German.

848
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:12,435
"We're gonna have demented sex,
right, Frank?"

849
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:17,962
That is the greatest party
I've ever seen. These sons of bitches!

850
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:20,426
Is he gonna take that stupid
little mannequin everywhere, man?

851
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:22,485
- That is freaking me out.
- Move past the mannequin.

852
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,102
They're just hanging out with
a bunch of half naked ladies,

853
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:26,143
and I just ran and sweated for
absolutely nothing?

854
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,670
Yeah, I don't sound like
that, all right.

855
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:29,534
- Goddamn it. Get past it.
- Who cares about the mannequin?

856
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:30,651
I care about the mannequin!

857
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,359
I look like a jerk
in front of those girls.

858
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:33,941
I'm putting an end to this right
now.

859
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:35,652
Yeah, dude, screw your dad.
Let him eat our asses.

860
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:37,293
Let him eat my butt
into smithereens.

861
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,199
I'm ending this.

862
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:42,358
Let's not be rash, right?
I mean, come on.

863
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,129
Look, if we're not gonna haunt them,
we should have a little fun, right?

864
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:46,601
Let's scare the shit out of
them.

865
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:50,381
- We got to make an entrance.
- Oh, let's scare the shit out of them.

866
00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:02,378
Jan, this is what I want, man.
You've given me what I want.

867
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:07,219
Look, I have this very kinky
surprise for you, my friend.

868
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:11,631
I've arranged for you to use
the glory hole!

869
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,833
I forgot about the glory hole.

870
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:17,464
- I just sent someone in there now.
- Yeah ?

871
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,249
Totally anonymous.

872
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,449
There are no words, man.

873
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:29,334
That's right, I'm the boss.

874
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:33,203
But I'm a good boss, and
I'm gonna allow you to watch.

875
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:37,858
"Okay, Frankie!"
Somebody's coming.

876
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:44,028
Any minute now, the German broad
is gonna knock on that wall,

877
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:49,394
which is my signal to go in my
pants, take out my penis

878
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,709
and stick it through the hole.

879
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,465
Then, she can go to town.

880
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,060
Hey, honey, you want to take
care of this monster for me or what ?

881
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:00,708
There is no way I can picture
that is a girl.

882
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,491
What the hell
are you doing here, man?

883
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,781
- Jan sent me.
- Jan sent me, too.

884
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:09,885
This is bad.

885
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,644
Everybody out!

886
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,597
Okay, there has been
a major miscommunication.

887
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:19,253
Get your European, sex-freaky
asses out of the bar.

888
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,399
Let's go, come on.
Come on, move it.

889
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,709
Move it, that's right.
Go, go, go!

890
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:23,555
Get out!

891
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:24,917
Let's go, ladies.
Let's go, let's go.

892
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,560
Get out, get out,
get out, get out.

893
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,948
- Hey, you too, Jan.
- Hey, beat it.

894
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:31,328
- What did I do?
- What did you do?

895
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,962
Jan, you were gonna have him
"glory hole" me.

896
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:36,329
- Yeah.
- Yeah, my ass. Get out of here.

897
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:37,315
You sex freak, go!

898
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:38,622
Americans are so uptight.

899
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,410
You ruined our glory hole.
Beat it and shut the door.

900
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:42,919
Sick freak.

901
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:43,708
You didn't know anything...

902
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,894
Weirdo.
What ?

903
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,048
Surprise, bitches!

904
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,852
We're alive, and it's blowing
your minds right now.

905
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:56,830
No, it is not blowing
our minds at all.

906
00:36:56,913 --> 00:36:58,610
I knew you guys were alive.

907
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:02,191
Yeah, I knew you guys were
alive, okay?

908
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:03,545
I figured it out right before
the funeral.

909
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:04,930
How?

910
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,797
'Cause I could hear you guys
rustling around in the vents.

911
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,724
You were speaking at full
volume, okay?

912
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,513
Did you think you were being,
like, crafty?

913
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,235
I could see you staring at me
through the window.

914
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:13,729
You know I can see through
my windows, right?

915
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:15,840
- I wanted to piss you off.
- Well, what about me?

916
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:16,908
Did you want to piss me off?

917
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:19,932
You, I thought, might
have actually been murdered.

918
00:37:20,015 --> 00:37:21,491
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought, okay?

919
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:22,633
Frank, you knew, too?

920
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,797
Yeah... I knew.

921
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:31,592
And some of the stuff you've been doing
with this mannequin here, that's like...

922
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,470
to teach me a lesson or...?

923
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:41,731
Did I see you bang that thing?

924
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,042
All right, you know what,
let's just...

925
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:45,582
But why were you guys pretending
that you were dead anyway?

926
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,040
That's a really messed
up thing to do.

927
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:49,447
My dad got out on parole.
He's coming to kill me and Charlie.

928
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,280
No, no, you got a letter
the other day.

929
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:53,080
- He sent a letter.
- Who sent a letter?

930
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:55,511
I got it, I got it.
It was sent to the bar.

931
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,426
"Dear son, I asked you
to leave me be...

932
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:03,825
forced me to do something that
I hoped I'd never have to do."

933
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:05,253
Oh, yeah, here we go.

934
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:08,043
"I just got out of prison,
and I'm heading to Tijuana.

935
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,970
I wanted to get as far away
from you as I could,

936
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:13,178
so that I could learn
how to forgive you.

937
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,207
Please do not try
to contact me ever.

938
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,533
I promise that
I'm not gonna hurt you.

939
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:19,532
Love, Dad.

940
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,349
P.S. : I still love you."

941
00:38:28,258 --> 00:38:29,209
See, 'cause we...

942
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,285
- This whole thing was...
- We didn't have to do all the...

943
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,927
Sorry about your car, Dee.

944
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:50,096
