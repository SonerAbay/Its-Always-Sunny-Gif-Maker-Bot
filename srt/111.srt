2
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,907
- This is so exciting.
- Is this the greenroom?

3
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:47,613
Yeah. A game show. Can you guys
believe we're gonna be on a game show?

4
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:49,917
- All right, all right, relax.
- Awesome!

5
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,857
Guys, the greenroom of <i>Family Fight.</i>
I've got goose bumps.

6
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,417
Yeah, all right, calm down.
Don't start acting like an animal here.

7
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,486
All right, listen, this is <i>Family Fight.</i>

8
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,395
This is a nationally televised program.

9
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,434
This is a very big deal for us, okay?

10
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,991
We're talking... What are you doing?

11
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,900
- Are you stealing an ashtray right now?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,269
Why? We have ashtrays,
and you don't even smoke.

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,935
This is a perfect place for me
to lay out my political agenda.

14
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,478
No, no, no. No politics, man.

15
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,810
- Why?
- Because it's too polarizing, okay?

16
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,111
And don't be misogynistic and
please don't be gross. I mean...

17
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:20,312
Guys, let's... let's be smart about this.
Let's be right down the middle.

18
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:22,252
Right down the middle sounds so boring.

19
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,085
That's not what the audience
wants to see.

20
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,148
Thinking I'm gonna do
a Jenny McCarthy thing...

21
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,456
where I'm, like, super sexy,
but I got a potty mouth.

22
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,393
Ah, no, no.
Dee, you are never going to be sexy.

23
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:34,195
And do not do a potty mouth thing, okay? We
don't want to come across as lowbrow animals.

24
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,668
Now, have some veggie platter and have some
fruit, okay? That is brain food.

25
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:41,036
Mm-mmm, no way, not me. Haven't eaten in
three days. I don't want to be puffy.

26
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:42,972
J-Mac's face, it's never puffy.

27
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:45,773
Yeah, because J-Mac's face
is stapled to the back of her head.

28
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,473
Now eat some food.
You look emaciated and sick.

29
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:53,486
- What is that?
- Fart noise key chain.

30
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:57,182
- Dennis, what is this enticing bowl of white?
- This?

31
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,781
Charlie, that... that's cottage cheese.

32
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,760
Cottage cheese?
Like... cheese from some cottage?

33
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,693
Whose cottage? Well, what is that exactly?

34
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:06,664
How do you not know what it is? Aren't you,
like, a cheese guy?

35
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,702
- I'm not a cottage guy.
- You are gonna make us lose this game.

36
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,363
Here comes the other family.

37
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,838
Hello.

38
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:15,670
You must be the Reynolds family.

39
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,337
I'm Janet, and we are the Barretts.

40
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:26,084
Oh. Okay.

41
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:29,553
Hey, guys! I'm Lisa. I'm the stage manager.

42
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,490
Both teams ready?

43
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,924
Let's play Family Fight!

44
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,752
Let's give it up for your host...

45
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:07,759
- Grant Anderson!
- How you doing, man?

46
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:09,556
Hi! Ah! Hello!

47
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,827
All right! Thank you for coming out,
everybody, and welcome to <i>Family Fight.</i>

48
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,200
I'm your host, Grant Anderson.
Today, we have the Barrett family!

49
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:23,299
Oh, all right. Versus the Reynolds family!

50
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:29,971
And they are here for a whole lot of cash,
so let's get it on!

51
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,211
Give me Janet, give me Frank.

52
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,082
Here we go.

53
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:36,520
Oh, whoa!

54
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,788
- Oh, I didn't get a good look at
you before backstage. -

55
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,590
Sha-booyah, roll call. Whoo!

56
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,393
Okay, all right, we got
some... some sparks flying already here.

57
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,366
But let's get up here and do this.

58
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:49,993
- Come on, Frank, you ready?
- I'm ready.

59
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,970
All right, man.
Top four answers on the board here.

60
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,007
Name an animal that we eat
but doesn't eat us.

61
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,007
- Frank!
- Pig!

62
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:58,010
Show me pig!

63
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,979
Oh, all right!

64
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,311
All right! Oh, Frank's doing
a little dance there. Ha!

65
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,783
- Now, Frank, you want to pass or
play? Pass or play? - Oh, we...

66
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,251
Play, play, play. We're gonna play.

67
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,754
All right, so, Frank...
You want to tell me...

68
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,415
- a little bit about your family?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,618
- Well, yeah, you know, uh, Grant?
- Yes, Grant.

70
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,490
I want to... I want to change my answer.

71
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,291
- What?
- What? Why?

72
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,924
I have realized it's-it's
not totally accurate...

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,628
because I've seen a pig eat a man.

74
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:27,696
In fact, I've seen many pigs eat many men.
It was a bloodbath.

75
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:29,765
Well, okay, well, we can't do that.

76
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,572
I'm gonna move on though
'cause you're losing me.

77
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,478
Yeah. Oh, Grant.

78
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,448
- A lighthearted barb, if you will.
- Sure, uh, sure.

79
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:41,044
His talk of pigs and man flesh is confusing
as it is frustrating.

80
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,520
Right.

81
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,149
- Don't you just wanna...
- I hear you, I hear you, Dennis.

82
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:47,489
- You have these people in your life
and you just wanna... -  Yeah.

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,494
Now, Dennis, why don't you
tell me something? What do you do?

84
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:52,690
Me? Oh, well, I am the proprietor of, uh...

85
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,758
- one of the most charming pubs in all
of South Philadelphia. - All right.

86
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:57,564
- Paddy's Pub.
- Paddy's Pub!

87
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,127
- Paddy's Pub.
- Paddy's Pub.

88
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:02,902
Yeah. Yeah, but listen,
I am so much more, Grant.

89
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,410
- Um, I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, if you will.
- Okay.

90
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,211
So the question really isn't "What <i>do</i> I do?"
It's "What don't I do?"

91
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,911
Wow. Now, there's a lot
of confidence right there. I like that.

92
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,851
- I like that, Dennis. All right.
- What a guy.

93
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,219
Buddy, can you name
an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us?

94
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,190
Ah, easy. Uh, sea urchin.

95
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,921
- Uh, what now?
- Sea urchin.

96
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,860
- Sea urchin.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,525
Okay. Show me sea urchin!

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,034
Ooh, one strike.

99
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,333
- Oh.
- One strike for the Reynolds here.

100
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:34,737
Wow, that, uh...
that buzzer sounds... It's awfully loud.

101
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,641
- It is loud.
- Pierces you right down to your soul, doesn't it?

102
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,372
I don't like it.
I'll be fine though. It's cool.

103
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:40,913
- You're right. All right, thank you.
- Okay.

104
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,845
- Who do we have here?
- Hi.

105
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,042
Hello, Deandra...

106
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,414
- Yep.
- Reynolds.

107
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,476
Deandra, help me out. Name an animal...

108
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,044
that we eat but doesn't eat us.

109
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,453
Well, Grant, I'll tell you what...

110
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,218
- Mm-hmm.
- I like to eat cock.

111
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,420
I'm sor... Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

112
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,258
- No, we can't say...
- Yeah.

113
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,230
- Lisa, are we gonna...
- See what I did there?

114
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,494
It's a little bit
of a double entendre type of thing.

115
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,195
I was talking about chicken,
but I said "cock."

116
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:04,600
Yeah, don't say that word.

117
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,605
Please, I'm-I'm... Just, it's a family show.

118
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:09,267
So we're just gonna go with "chicken," okay?
Show me chicken!

119
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,404
There you go.

120
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,242
- Okay. Ronald Reynolds.
- Yeah!

121
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:19,580
- Hello, sir.
- Hey!

122
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:20,983
- How you doing today?
- I'm great, Grant.

123
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:22,783
I'm just really excited to be
here with my new family.

124
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,517
- Oh... Your new family?
- Yeah.

125
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,388
- Oh, a little bit of background.
- Yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,586
Uh, actually, just for... for clarification.

127
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,858
Um, he raised them, but he didn't sire them.

128
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:34,525
Now, he may have sired him...
we're not exactly sure...

129
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,466
- but they do live together in squalor.
- Yeah, yeah.

130
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:40,097
I brought my blood bucket in case you guys
want to run his blood and see if it checks out.

131
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:43,165
- It'd be good to know. - Yeah, if we
want to do a quick DNA sequencing...

132
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,438
at the commercial break, that actually would
clear things up for everybody.

133
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,241
- If we could.
- It would set the record straight.

134
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:49,975
Either way, I was always
the odd man out, you know? I mean, you know.

135
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,744
And then Frank here adopted me.

136
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,911
And now I'm a part of the Reynolds family!

137
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,955
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, well...

138
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:59,824
We don't... I'm-I'm just...

139
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,088
- I'm not even gonna try to figure
that one out, so... -

140
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:03,959
Okay, here's the deal, guys. From now on...

141
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,193
- I'm not gonna ask you guys any
more questions at all... - Yes!

142
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,360
Other than the ones
that keep the game moving.

143
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:10,925
- Great! Yeah!
- All right?

144
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,562
Great!

145
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,970
Show me cow!

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,133
Nope, that's me. I say that word.

147
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,109
I say the "show me" part.
You just give me the answer.

148
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,703
- Okay, Ronald?
- Right, I'm sorry. Show me co...

149
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,305
- Don't say "show me." Don't say it.
- You just said that.

150
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,442
- Just say the answer.
- Show... "Show me"  is the part I say?

151
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:28,248
Here's the one thing...
There's only one thing in the whole world...

152
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,687
"Show me."

153
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,988
So just give me the answer,
and then I'll say sh...

154
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,358
You know what, go ahead and do it.
Just go ahead and do it then.

155
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,522
- Do what?
- Mother of...

156
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:40,361
Show me cow!

157
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,025
Cow!

158
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,967
- Okay, well?
- Good answer.

159
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,567
So, sadly we gotta stay here. Okay.

160
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,338
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

161
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,505
- Just need you to name an animal...
- Yeah!

162
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,845
That we eat but doesn't eat us.

163
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,611
"Doesn't eat us." That's easy.

164
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:02,280
Dragon!

165
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,653
- Charlie, do you eat dragon?
- No! I don't eat dragon...

166
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,692
'cause, uh, it's-it's
not a meal for peasants...

167
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,193
it's a meal for kings,
and I'm sort of a common man.

168
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,628
But they don't eat us.
They, uh... It's, like, a misconception.

169
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,325
They actually eat gold and treasure.

170
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,663
- That's why they're always sitting on a
big pile of it. -  Bad answer.

171
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,032
- Bad answer.
- Bad answer.

172
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,695
- Bad answer.
- That's a bad answer.

173
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:21,399
Okay, show me dragon!

174
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:26,870
- I told you!
- Oh, my God!

175
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,483
Well, astonishingly, uh,
one person surveyed...

176
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,021
gave the answer "dragon," so...

177
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,819
What a world! All right.

178
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,292
The Reynolds family has won round one!

179
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,057
There you go, all right.

180
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,825
- Sha-booyah! Sha-booyah!
- All right.

181
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,925
But we got a lot more show to go!
It could be anybody's game.

182
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:52,438
We'll be right back after this
with <i>Family Fight!</i>

183
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,465
That's commercial, guys! Back in three.

184
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,772
Yeah!

185
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,040
- We nailed it.
- Yeah, that was, uh... that was terrible.

186
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,379
We're bombing out there. This-This is
exactly what I was trying to avoid, guys.

187
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,384
What are you talking about?
We won that round.

188
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,147
Yeah, but you were being
lascivious and disgusting.

189
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,746
Dee was making sex jokes
that were going over like a lead balloon.

190
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:14,020
- At least we got all of our answers right.
- Yeah, that's utterly ridiculous.

191
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:16,960
I mean, how is dragon an answer
and sea urchin isn't? Everyone knows...

192
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,521
I don't know, but there's always a weirdo
or two in those panels...

193
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,193
who's gonna give a stupid answer, and
Charlie's always gonna get those, right?

194
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,758
- So...
- Yeah, I'll get the steal.

195
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,667
- Yeah. - Plus, people don't even
really eat sea urchin, Dennis.

196
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,569
Most people don't eat dragons.

197
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,006
- Well, dragonflies.
- People don't eat dragonflies.

198
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,670
Don't make that noise. I don't like it.

199
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,235
Just relax, would you, Dennis?

200
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,509
If we make asses out of ourselves, they just
won't air the episode.

201
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,072
Okay, first of all, you don't know that.

202
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,584
And secondly, don't tell me to relax.

203
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,280
All right, don't you start making that noise.

204
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,255
It's not funny when they do it.
It's definitely not funny...

205
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,315
Oh! Ooh!

206
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,690
Oh, goddamn it!

207
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,000
And welcome back to <i>Family Fight.</i>

208
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,697
We got the Reynolds family
over here with 100 points.

209
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,705
We got the Barretts over here with zero.

210
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,331
Give me Bobby, give me Dennis!

211
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,706
Here we go!

212
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,403
Okay. Oh, hey, Bobby, all right.

213
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:11,882
All right, somebody got
a little... a little lead in his shoes.

214
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,647
No.

215
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,918
No. No,
my shoes are fine. I assure you.

216
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,118
They're made of the finest Italian leather.
The fit is perfect.

217
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,058
Therefore, there would be no room for lead.

218
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:25,828
All right.

219
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,832
Top four answers on the board.

220
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,802
We asked a hundred people on the street, "Name
something people groom themselves with."

221
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,361
Dennis!

222
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,634
- Laser beams, Grant.
- La-Laser beams.

223
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,973
Yeah, laser beam. It's the only way to
completely obliterate the follicle.

224
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,536
Show me laser beam!

225
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,981
- Ooh!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

226
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,986
That noise, it's too loud.
Can we... Can we just turn it down a touch?

227
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,386
We cannot, we cannot.
Bobby, you got an answer?

228
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,946
- I got an answer.
- All right.

229
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,686
- Hair brush!
- Show me hair brush!

230
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,160
Okay, we want to play!

231
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,757
Hair brush, that's so obvious.

232
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,699
God, that buzzer noise!
Isn't that just irritating as hell?

233
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,931
- We gotta think of a steal here.
- I got one!

234
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,438
What about bleaching cream
for your facial hair?

235
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:08,906
- What the hell?
- No, no.

236
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:11,910
- I-I got it... Drakkar Noir.
- Mmm, too specific.

237
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,572
You know what it is? I think it's a bride.
A bride could be a good answer.

238
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,911
- Show me clippers!
- What?

239
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:20,111
You can't become a groom
or get groomed without a bride.

240
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,448
- Oh, no.
- Right, right.

241
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,421
That's not the kind of grooming
they're talking about.

242
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,423
- I don't know. Charlie could be right.
- Yeah. I got dragon.

243
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:28,085
No, he's not... He's not right.
Because nobody else is that stupid.

244
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,459
Show me pumice stone!

245
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,666
All right, here we go.
Reynolds family for the steal!

246
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,862
- No, no, we're not gonna say that.
- The comb, a comb!

247
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,461
I'm gonna go with...

248
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,137
toe knife.

249
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,073
Wi-With what now?

250
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,112
With a toe knife, 'cause I... I use a-a...

251
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,809
a sharp blade to dig the scum
out of my toenails.

252
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:52,942
Once in a while, I cut myself...

253
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,920
but it "puses" up,
and in three days, it's good as new.

254
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,319
- Sure.
- Toe knife!

255
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,690
- Way more information than we
needed, but, uh... -

256
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,127
Show me toe knife.

257
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:06,995
The Barretts win the board!

258
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,330
There you go! All right!

259
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,802
Okay, let's see what...
see what that last answer was.

260
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:13,963
Bride!

261
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,507
- Charlie was right.
- I knew it.

262
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,770
Do you... Do you groom a bride, Lisa?

263
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,709
All right, hey,
let's get on to that last round now!

264
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,247
I need some Dee, I need
a little bit of Lester! Come on down!

265
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,718
- Okay.
- Come on, Dee!

266
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,651
All right.

267
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:32,248
- Okay, here we go. Top six answers
are on the board. -

268
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:35,351
Name something that people are afraid of.

269
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,589
- Oh!
- Whoa! Oh!

270
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,097
Oh, oopsie-daisy!

271
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,191
Looks like I... I broke it.

272
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:44,133
- You think?
- Oops.

273
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:47,263
Can't believe... Ain't never seen anything
like that in my life.

274
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,831
What, do you got hands made of anvils?

275
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,174
You want me to answer that
or answer the... this one?

276
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:56,215
- I don't want you to answer either
of them, okay? - Yeah, sorry.

277
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,716
Because I don't know who won
because you broke the machine.

278
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,479
- That makes sense. It makes sense, yeah.
- Right? Okay?

279
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:04,182
Okay. Everybody, we're gonna
take a couple seconds.

280
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:07,055
- We'll be right back after this.
- Okay.

281
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:17,728
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

282
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,169
Start thinking of a steal,
because if we get this one, we win the game.

283
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:24,039
- All right, all right. What's the question?
- Things people are afraid of.

284
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,409
- That's still the question? - Yes. How do
you not know how the game works by now?

285
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,414
Okay, I'm afraid of game show rules.

286
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,177
- You guys, I know what it is.
- Yeah?

287
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,047
- It's failure.
- That's too pathetic.

288
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,883
Liberal yahoos taking my guns.

289
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,185
That... That is a political
firestorm, Frank. No!

290
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:39,849
Oh, oh! The Nightman.

291
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:42,759
All right, guys,
these are terrible answers, all right?

292
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:46,628
Now, normally I would've said the crust on
a crème brûlée burning the top of your mouth...

293
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,826
but I'm thinking like a commoner now,
and I really do think...

294
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:52,064
that the right answer is probably... clowns.

295
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,504
- That's a good answer.
- I know.

296
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:57,270
- I feel it could be Nightman.
- No, I feel like it isn't the Nightman...

297
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:58,935
He could be right, dude.

298
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,206
Show me dogs!

299
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,475
God...

300
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:04,880
No.

301
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,010
Okay, Reynolds, you get a chance to steal...

302
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:08,610
and win the whole game right here.

303
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:12,454
- Okay. All right.
- Name something that people are afraid of.

304
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,049
We're gonna go with...

305
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:16,560
Wait, wait, Frank. You have to say it
in the form of a question.

306
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,427
- What is it...
- No, you don't, you don't...

307
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:21,090
You don't have to do that
'cause it's not <i>Jeopardy!</i>

308
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,395
- Ah, it's not <i>Jeopardy!</i>
- All right?

309
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,231
Say "show me," Frank.

310
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:27,272
Don't say "show me," Frank.
Just say the word. Just say the word.

311
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,366
- Show me clowns.
- Show me clowns!

312
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,578
We did it! We did it!

313
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,410
And the Reynolds win the game!

314
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,245
The Reynolds win the game!

315
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,650
Sha-booyah, sha-booyah,
sha-booyah, you lose!

316
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,986
Sha-booyah, sha-booyah,
sha-booyah, you lose! Woo-hoo!

317
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:47,252
All right, okay. So, anyway...

318
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,453
Let's take a look
at the last one, everybody.

319
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,933
Nightman. Don't know what that is.

320
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,491
- Just don't know what it is.
- What is happening?

321
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,333
Pretty strange answers today!

322
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:02,033
All right, man. We're gonna come right back
and play some Fast Money.

323
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,250
- How the hell was "Nightman" an answer?
- Right.

324
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,652
Dude, I think I'm remembering what happened.
I took this survey.

325
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:19,520
I got interviewed at a mall and I thought it
was, like, a government thing.

326
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,856
- Okay, all right.
- That makes a lot more sense.

327
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,122
- That's actually the only thing that makes sense.
- Right? Okay.

328
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,664
So I should play Fast Money,
because I'm gonna know all the answers.

329
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,324
No, no, no, you're only
gonna know <i>your</i> answers.

330
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,335
And that's only gonna
get us one point for every question.

331
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:33,702
- We need to get all the top answers to win
Fast Money. - Right, totally, totally.

332
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,071
- And then we spin the wheel.
- Okay, you're definitely not gonna play...

333
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,007
- 'cause you can't understand a thing
that's happening. - I'll play.

334
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:40,102
No, you won't play, because you've been
nothing but gross and foul...

335
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,669
and polarizing the entire time.

336
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,908
- You're embarrassing me in front
of the whole nation. Dee... - Mmm.

337
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,473
- You and I are gonna play.
- Yeah?

338
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,212
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I do my fart key chain?

339
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,584
Absolutely goddamn not. Now go get something
to eat. You look terrible.

340
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,749
No, no, no. I'm very hungry, but I'm not
gonna blow it now. This is my close-up.

341
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,816
Oh, God, don't be
a dumb, hungry bitch the entire time.

342
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:55,986
- Guys, we're back.
- Ooh!

343
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,290
All right, you're going first, Dee.

344
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,955
- You're going first.
- Come on, Dee! Go, Dee!

345
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,696
All right, we are back with Fast Money,
here with Dee Reynolds.

346
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:10,401
But first, there's somebody who
wants to say something to you.

347
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:12,808
<i>Yeah? Hey, Reynolds family!</i>

348
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:16,974
<i>Win 20,000 and bring home
the money for Paddy's Pub!</i>

349
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,914
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

350
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:21,646
- <i>I'm done dancing like a monkey. Give me my
five bucks, Charlie.</i> -

351
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:25,589
Ha-ha, wow! That was a rough video right
there. That dude is hard on the eyes.

352
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:26,989
Yeah. He's all burned up.

353
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,926
- We couldn't get anybody else?
- No.

354
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,964
- Okay, you ready, Dee?
- Oh, you better believe it.

355
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,294
- But, uh...
- Mm-hmm?

356
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,631
First, hold on a... hold on a second.

357
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,294
- Yeah?
- There's, um...

358
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,463
- There's, uh... Ooh!
- You okay?

359
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,301
- Yeah.
- You all right?

360
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:45,606
Uh, yes. There's a...
Just a quick bit I wanted to, uh...

361
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,168
- Oof.
- Oh!

362
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,578
Oh, whoops-a-daisy.

363
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,308
That's about as lowbrow as it gets.

364
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:54,944
Yeah, Dennis isn't gonna like that.

365
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,113
- It's pretty funny though.
- Okay, new plan.

366
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,122
All right.

367
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,819
- This is so good.
- Yeah.

368
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,988
So we're back here with,
uh, Fast Money here.

369
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,760
Uh, and now we got Frank doing it, 'cause...

370
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,960
people just be faintin' up in here, so...

371
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,526
Okay, give me 30 seconds on the clock.

372
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:15,733
- Name something you thought existed
when you were a child. - Santa Claus.

373
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,606
- Name something you might find in a bathtub.
- Soap!

374
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,612
- Name something people add sugar to.
- Coffee.

375
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,581
- A thing you associate with Charlie Chaplin.
- Little mustache.

376
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,609
- Name a foreign country whose films
are popular in America. - France.

377
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,177
Damn!

378
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,520
You did it, man! That was great!

379
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,492
- Yeah, man! That was really good!
- That was so good, Frank!

380
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,927
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

381
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,024
- Frank did great.
- Frank?

382
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,966
- Yeah, uh, Dee passed out.
- She...

383
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:47,665
- Of course she did. She's so embarrassing.
- Right.

384
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,470
All right, here we go, everybody. We're
gonna bring Dennis out right now.

385
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:52,272
Here he is, Dennis Reynolds.

386
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,812
- Here we go.
- Yeah, Dennis!

387
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,541
All right.

388
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:59,379
Okay. Now, Dennis...

389
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,512
Frank got the number one answer
for every single question...

390
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:06,422
- so you only need five points to win the game.
- Okay, I can do it.

391
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:08,960
- Now, Grant, listen, I know I gave
some bad answers before. - Yes.

392
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:12,657
But I understand the game perfectly now,
and, uh, that does not represent me.

393
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,528
- I like that.
- So I'm ready to give good answers.

394
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,090
- I like that.
- That does represent me.

395
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,328
All right, that sounds good.

396
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,200
If you repeat any of Frank's answers...

397
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,102
you're gonna hear this sound.

398
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,266
- Mm-hmm. And then...
- Thought we were done with the buzzer.

399
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,503
- Oh, only if you repeat an answer.
- Even in this round?

400
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,603
Yes, even in this round. Yep. Mm-hmm.

401
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,773
If you don't know an answer,
you can say "pass"...

402
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,783
- and we'll just move on to the next question.
- Okay.

403
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,478
- All right, are you ready?
- Yes, yes.

404
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:34,678
Thirty seconds on the clock.

405
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,879
- Name something you thought existed
when you were a child. - Santa Claus.

406
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,791
Oh, God. Uh, pass.

407
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,125
- Name something you might find in a bathtub.
- S... Uh, soap.

408
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,220
Ah!

409
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,696
God, I really hate that buzzer.

410
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,255
- Can we not do that?
- Clock's ticking.

411
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,167
- Okay, uh, pass.
- Name something people add sugar to.

412
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,034
God. Coffee.

413
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:55,005
- Oh, God.
- No, no.

414
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,905
- Nope, we gotta... We need an answer.
- Yeah, no, no.

415
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,568
Okay, no, then pass, then pass, 'cause...

416
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,942
- A thing you associate with Charlie Chaplin.
- Mmm... Pass.

417
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:04,881
Mm-hmm. Okay, name a foreign
country whose films are popular in America.

418
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,178
France.

419
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:07,685
- Oh, God, no, no!
- Already said that.

420
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,243
Oh, God, France. France...

421
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,414
- That's still not the answer.
- Little mustache.

422
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,980
Soap, soap, France.

423
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,787
- Say something!
- Go with something else!

424
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,691
You said that already. Don't say "France."

425
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,252
- Give up.
- All right.

426
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,493
I have never seen a more embarrassing
display in my entire career.

427
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,467
Oh, but please don't air this.

428
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,128
Okay?
Please don't... don't air this.

429
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,695
- You won't air this, right?
- We definitely air it. We always air it.

430
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:30,003
- No matter what. That's how we do it.
- But this went so wrong.

431
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,475
Good night, everybody!
Thanks for joining us here on <i>Family Fight!</i>

432
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,035
- This doesn't represent me.
- Take care.

433
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,542
- <i>Ah, God!</i>
- Why'd they have to air that part?

434
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,951
- That was the end part.
- The best part.

435
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,956
Yeah, they air the whole show.

436
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,895
<i>This doesn't represent me though.</i>

437
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:57,993
<i>This doesn't represent me.
That's not who I am.</i>

438
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,732
<i>So just... So just don't air it.</i>

439
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:04,037
<i>- It's the buzzer that was...
- This doesn't represent me.</i>

440
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,909
<i>So just don't air it!</i>
