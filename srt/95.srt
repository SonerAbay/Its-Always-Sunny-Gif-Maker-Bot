1
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:06,812
Good morning, Philadelphia.

2
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:08,518
With us today is Frank Reynolds,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,220
local business owner and a
man with a harrowing story.

4
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:12,221
That's right.

5
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:16,125
A few days ago, three
thugs tried to mug me.

6
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:18,327
And I want to be very
clear about something.

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,630
Um, Mr...
These pieces of garbage, they

8
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:22,565
don't know who the hell
they're dealing with.

9
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:23,533
Mr. Reynolds, excuse me.

10
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,635
Do you think maybe you could
eat that sandwich later?

11
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:26,636
I'm starving.

12
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:28,838
You don't have nothing
to eat in this show.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,806
Let's get back to your story.

14
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:31,774
Right, so these punks... 
Yes.

15
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,876
...I don't know if they
wanted money or they wanted

16
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:34,844
something more sexual.

17
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:35,812
Wow.

18
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:37,747
But it's a lucky thing
I had my pieces.

19
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:38,714
Your-your pieces?

20
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:39,682
My guns.

21
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:40,683
Oh, my.

22
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:41,684
Anyway, I started blasting.

23
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,352
Bah! Bah!

24
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:45,455
Now, I don't see so good, so I
missed, then they ran away, I

25
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:46,422
ran after them.

26
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:47,090
Okay.

27
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,258
Bang! Tried to shoot them in
the back, but I don't run so

28
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,259
good either.

29
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:54,030
Anyway, you guys all think I'm
a hero, and I'll accept that

30
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:55,498
responsibility.

31
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,934
Now, weren't you concerned
though that an innocent

32
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:00,036
bystander may have...
Look, crime in this city is

33
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,971
out of control.
Mm.

34
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:05,241
Thank God I went down to
Gunther's Guns and picked up a

35
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:07,176
spare.
I don't think one would've done

36
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:10,746
it. I'm gonna go out and
buy some more. Okay.

37
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:12,381
And I think you should, too.
Don't be a victim.

38
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:14,450
- It's time to fight back.
- This is crazy.

39
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:16,385
- Completely insane.
- Oh, it's driving

40
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:18,020
- me nuts.
- The whole gun thing,

41
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:19,956
it just makes me really hot.
Yeah, well, it's a hot issue

42
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,557
and I'm getting hot about it,
too.

43
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,192
This is good, we're all hot
at the same time.

44
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:25,128
We should do something about...
I mean, our schools aren't

45
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,762
safe.
There are people out on the

46
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:28,698
streets with assault rifles?
We're living in constant

47
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,299
fear!
Aw, guys, we got to get more

48
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,268
guns on the streets!
Yeah!

49
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,203
Wait, what?
We got to get more guns onto

50
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,139
the streets.
Yeah, we got to get guns in

51
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:37,773
the right hands.
I mean, we're just not safe.

52
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,375
That's what you guys are hot
about?

53
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:41,010
Yeah, didn't you hear what
Frank said?

54
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,945
Yeah, what are you hot about?
There are too many guns on

55
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:44,881
the streets as it is.
Guns off the streets is what we

56
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,816
need.
It's way too easy for anybody

57
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:48,451
to just walk into a store and
get a gun.

58
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,386
No, it's not.
It getting harder and harder.

59
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,321
The government's trying to take
our guns away.

60
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,956
It's way harder than you think,
dude.

61
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,892
Guys, we're hot about the
complete opposite.

62
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:57,527
Shoot.
Which is a bummer, 'cause I

63
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,462
thought we were on the same page
for once.

64
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:01,164
Still very hot though.

65
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,990
Yeah. Oh, I'm even hotter if I'm being honest.
Still hot.

66
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:24,606

67
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:31,925
Good call on these
outfits, dude.

68
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,164
It's the only call.

69
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,165
You know what I mean?

70
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,199
Like, you need a guy in a school

71
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:39,070
that even from a mile away, the
school shooter sees that guy

72
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,237
and says, "Uh-uh."

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,173
"I ain't messing
with that dude."

74
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,808
"I'm not messing with that
dude.

75
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,810
I'm not going near that school."
Uh, gentlemen, I

76
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:49,713
understand that you would
like to...

77
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:53,317
You... How-how did you find me?
Oh, shit, I know this dude.

78
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,153
Who-Who's this?
This guy was the principal at

79
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,122
the high school where I was
doing the janitor thing.

80
00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:00,057
Yeah.
Right, so why are you at a

81
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,026
middle school now?
Well, I was... I was

82
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,961
transferred.
See, I have tenure, so they

83
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:05,930
couldn't actually fire me, which
was, of course, their first

84
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:07,865
choice, thanks to you.
Well, let's not throw barbs

85
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,834
at each other.
Look, we're actually here for a

86
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,769
good cause.
We want to protect this school.

87
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,404
Oh.
Yeah, we want to be the armed

88
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,339
security guards.
Yeah, I brought a piece.

89
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,308
We're good.
Hey, hey, hey, no, no!

90
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,243
Calm yourself.
No, you got to put... no...

91
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,212
It's not currently loaded.
That's not the...

92
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,147
Just put it away.
I hear you, buddy.

93
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,116
I would not want to be around
this guy with a gun either.

94
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:27,084
He has got a hair trigger.
I mean, one little move and

95
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,053
he'll just start blasting.
Uh, bullshit.

96
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,988
Look, the point is he
shouldn't have a gun in a school

97
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,957
in the first place anyway.
No.

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,892
Guns just do not belong in
schools.

99
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,861
No, they do not.
That is why I brought along a

100
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:39,563
saber.
Aw, Jesus Christ.

101
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,765
Which is just about the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen

102
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,701
in my life, because how are you
gonna stop a gunman with that?

103
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:45,336
Bro...
He's gonna get you from a

104
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,971
distance.
If I come at you, I'll get to

105
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,906
you faster.
We have been arguing about this

106
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,541
all day.
Because it's insanity.

107
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:52,476
Ooh, maybe you can be
the judge.

108
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:54,111
I don't want... What?
Here we go.

109
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm gonna holster my weapon,
he'll holster his weapon.

110
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,681
No, we, no...
I'll do, like, a one, two,

111
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,316
three count, you tell us who
goes faster.

112
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,252
Please don't do this in here.
Look, dude, this is the only

113
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,220
way to tell, okay?
And then we can protect your

114
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,156
school, but we got to go one
step at a time, all right?

115
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:07,625
I mean, for God's sake...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

116
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,693
Sorry, sorry.
Look out!

117
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:14,131
Ah.

118
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,100
I guess I do have a hair
trigger, huh?

119
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:17,735
Yeah.
All right.

120
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:20,638
Look at all these maniacs.
Goddamn bloodthirsty freaks

121
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,606
walking in off the street.
So easy for anybody to just

122
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:24,241
waltz in and buy a gun.
Let's do it.

123
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,177
Let's buy assault rifles and
just prove to Mac and Charlie

124
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,112
how easy it is.
Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna.

125
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,080
That's what we'll do.
Hi, how are you, sir?

126
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:32,016
Howdy, I'm Gunther.
What can I do for you?

127
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,518
Oh, Gunther himself, purveyor
of destruction.

128
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,921
I would like to buy a man
destroyer from you, please.

129
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,856
Yeah, nice to meet you,
Gunther.

130
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,492
Hey, maybe you could recommend
something that could blow a hole

131
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,894
through an elephant, you know.
'Cause I need that for my home

132
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:45,863
protection.
Yeah.

133
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:47,998
I guess you're looking at an
AR-15.

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,967
Oh, look at that.
Yeah, that's great.

135
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,036
Now, theoretically, Gunther,
would I be able to slaughter a

136
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:53,971
roomful of innocent people
with that weapon?

137
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:56,340
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Brother, that'd be on you.

138
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:58,008
That would be on me, wouldn't
it?

139
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,476
Yeah, that wouldn't be on you
at all.

140
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:00,778
But here you go.
But here you go.

141
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,413
But here you go.
Okay, great, we'll take one of

142
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,014
those, please.
Yeah, we got it.

143
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,784
How much would that be?
Uh, that's $1,500.

144
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:09,520
Woof!
$1,500 for the privilege, okay.

145
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,056
Hey, what is your, uh, what
is your return policy there?

146
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:14,558
30 days, no charge.
All right.

147
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,794
Ooh, 30 days, sounds fair.
My goodness, Dennis, this feels

148
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,196
good.
Feels good in my hands.

149
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:23,601
Oh, good my kids are safe.

150
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,569
I saved everyone!
Yeah, my yard's protected.

151
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,504
So, of course, it feels good,
you know?

152
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,473
But that only proves our point
even more.

153
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,075
We'll take two of these,
Gunther.

154
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,177
Great.
I'll need your licenses for the

155
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,112
background checks.
Okay, yeah.

156
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:37,081
Yeah, you can drive, you can
kill!

157
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,384
Oh, Christ, look at this.

158
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:43,454
Oh, God.
Oh, shit, I love this guy.

159
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,656
...become a bit of a local
lightning rod in these gun

160
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,524
debates here.
Exactly.

161
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,859
Gun sales have skyrocketed.

162
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:51,996
We're running out of guns, and
we have to manufacture more

163
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:54,431
guns; supply is not
meeting the demand.

164
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,100
Can we...
can we cut?

165
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,102
Will my hands look this
small on the screen?

166
00:05:58,104 --> 00:05:59,069
Uh, we're live, sir.

167
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,338
I thought the camera would add
ten pounds to my hands, and

168
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,439
I don't like the way they look.

169
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,741
Your hands look fine.

170
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,775
Put them down.

171
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:06,143
This is Jack Kelly.

172
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,211
He's my attorney.

173
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:10,347
He specializes in
Constitutional Law.

174
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,283
Our rights are being
infringed upon.

175
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,286
And people like my client
won't take it anymore.

176
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:18,522
The Constitution guarantees
our Second Amendment rights.

177
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,090
And these liberals like Al Gore,

178
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:21,759
they're trying to take that away

179
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,028
from us with this global
warming bullshit.

180
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,864
So, you see the two issues
as related somehow?

181
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,232
Damn right.

182
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:31,468
The government of today has no
right telling us how to live

183
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,504
our lives, because the
government of 200 years ago

184
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:34,738
already did.

185
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,539
Yeah.

186
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,640
Oh, okay.

187
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:41,278
They also protected us from
tyranny against the seizure of

188
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,581
tasteful, artistic photographs
of beautiful bodies.

189
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,883
Not now, Jack.

190
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:46,850
That same government wants to

191
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,987
come into our home, tell us
what is and what is not art?

192
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,288
That's not right!

193
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,223
Okay, well, I'm gonna try
and, uh, keep things on track

194
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,992
here, so... Yeah.

195
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:57,594
Get out and get those guns
before they run out, and the

196
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:59,330
government changes the laws.

197
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,098
All right! Yeah!

198
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,667
These idiots are buying this?
It's crazy.

199
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,903
What is going on?
That was fast.

200
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,005
You've been denied.
What?

201
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,673
That's ludicrous.
Why?

202
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:12,876
It says here you have an
extensive history of felonious

203
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:15,179
behavior.
Oh, there have been

204
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:18,115
incidents, sure, yeah, a few
minor indiscretions, but,

205
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,818
you know, I-I'm simply a person
of interest in most of those

206
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,153
cases, all right?
Being wanted and being "wanted

207
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:26,056
for questioning" are very, very,
very different things, Gunther.

208
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:27,725
And you've been
institutionalized.

209
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,493
Me?
She... she... yeah.

210
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,730
What... I mean, one time, for
a short period of time.

211
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,865
That-that was against my will.
That doesn't even really count.

212
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,600
That's the only time it
counts, Dee.

213
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:38,469
Okay, look, it was, like, a
teeny thing that happened with a

214
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,571
college roommate.
It was really no big deal.

215
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,339
Uh, yeah.
Says here you burned her.

216
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:43,741
I burned her, yeah.
I burned her.

217
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:46,510
But...
She was so annoying.

218
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:49,246
I mean, it...
She deserved it, okay?

219
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:51,215
She was wearing my stuff, and
she was copying me, and...

220
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,850
You were copying her.
I was copying her, she was

221
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,184
copying me...
It doesn't matter.

222
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:56,954
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't
sell you the guns.

223
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,655
Oh, God.
Oh, well, look at you.

224
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:02,025
Oh, Gunther the morality king.
"Hi, I'm Gunther, I've never lit

225
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,695
anybody on fire before."
You know, you light one bitch on

226
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:07,598
fire, and everybody freaks out!
Oh, you son of a bitch.

227
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,533
It was one time and one thing,
I just...

228
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:10,834
All right, all right, all
right, relax, relax.

229
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:13,404
Okay, take it easy.

230
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,905
Look, there are other ways to
buy guns where people don't go

231
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:17,775
snooping around in your past.
Listen, pal...

232
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:21,111
you just made my list.
Your list?

233
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:23,147
Yeah, I have a...
Shh.

234
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,648
Whatever, let's just go.
Let's go.

235
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,751
How is that tasteless?
It's art.

236
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,219
Get that out.
Get that out.

237
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,655
You can't even see the child...
We'll be right back.

238
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:34,892
Weather, traffic and a trip
to the zoo, coming right up.

239
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,225
Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna
demonstrate to you how to thwart

240
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,215
an attack.
Mm-hmm.

241
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,271
Now, pretend that this dummy
is a school shooter.

242
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,690
Right.
I want you to stand back,

243
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,627
'cause I don't want you to get
hurt.

244
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:49,001
Before he can draw his weapon...
Hie-aught!

245
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:52,004
Hup, hut, hut!
Hie!

246
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:54,787
How awesome was that?
Well, yeah, that's-that's

247
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,989
pretty awesome, but I feel like
he would've shot you from a mile

248
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,958
away.
No, no, he wouldn't, because

249
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,060
you saw how I was zigzagging
like this and making sounds?

250
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,062
It was distracting.
Yeah, but did you ever see

251
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,997
<i>Indiana Jones,</i> where the guy
does the whole sword thing and

252
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,632
then he just shoots him dead?
Are you asking me if I've

253
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,134
seen <i>Indiana Jones?</i>
<i>Are you seriously asking me?</i>

254
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,469
I've seen that movie...
That <i>is</i> my...

255
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:11,804
You're not understanding.
Do you remember it?

256
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,472
Yes.
But if I were to come at you,

257
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:15,608
it's all about how I...

258
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,843
Okay, in that circumstance,
maybe you got there a little bit

259
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:19,245
faster.
I got you.

260
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,646
But if I...!
Okay.

261
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,047
I got you again.
But I... What if I zigzag

262
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,683
like this?
It's so easy to get you.

263
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,619
And that's... that's not
necessarily...

264
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:28,921
I don't think that that's...
Hold-hold on a second.

265
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:31,891
Look at this kid.
Ooh, he's wearing all black,

266
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,026
he's walking by himself.
What do you think he's doing

267
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:35,427
on that phone?
Oh, I'll tell you exactly

268
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:36,862
what he's doing.
He's playing one of those games

269
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:38,797
where you shoot everyone.
I'm gonna profile this guy

270
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,099
really quick.
Excuse us.

271
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,400
Yeah. Hey, kid, kid, kid.
Stop, stop.

272
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:42,935
Son, son, I'm sorry, hold
up, hold up.

273
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,737
What are you doing on the phone
there?

274
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,372
None of your business.

275
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:47,706
A sass-mouth, huh?
That's a red flag.

276
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,808
Son, you were asked a
question by an adult, okay?

277
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,477
You've been asked a question,
all right?

278
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,646
We're trying to ensafen your
school here, okay?

279
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,547
And you're acting like a punk?
Let me see the phone.

280
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,117
I want to see.
Oh! He's killing zombies!

281
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,652
I'm taking this.
What the hell, man?

282
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:01,420
Hey, kid, you're getting off
easy!

283
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:02,855
Now get to school.
Go to school.

284
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:04,924
Just know we're watching you.
Go to class.

285
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:06,692
Be careful.
Look.

286
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,928
This is a red flag.
These are the kids that are the

287
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,096
threats to society, the ones
playing the violent video games,

288
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:13,599
man.
I play violent video games.

289
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,868
Well, yeah, I also play
violent video games.

290
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,469
I watch violent movies.
Well, yeah, violent movies

291
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,971
are the best movies.
And I don't want to kill

292
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,606
people.
No, I mean...

293
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,808
All right, this...
Yeah, it's not really the best

294
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,476
way to tell, you know, who's
gonna be a threat or who's not

295
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:26,612
gonna...
What is going on out here?

296
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,381
Nothing, thanks to us, bro.
Well, are-are you stealing

297
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,650
kids' cell phones?
Stealing, sir? No.

298
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,719
I've been confiscating them as
potential evidence.

299
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,654
Are you aware that you're
holding children up with a gun

300
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,623
and-and a sword?
You just... you need to stay off

301
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,558
of school property.
Sir, we are not on the school

302
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,360
property, okay?
Yeah, we're outside of the

303
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,162
fence by, like...
We're on the sidewalk, see?

304
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,764
You need to stay 1,000 yards
away from school property.

305
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,566
I mean, we're trying to keep
the school safe!

306
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,335
I know, well, yeah.
Well, yeah, we would all feel a

307
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:51,103
lot safer if you were further
away.

308
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,938
All right, I'm taking this
guy out.

309
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,541
Hey, whoa, settle!
Settle, settle, settle!

310
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,509
Settle. Settle down.
Would you please stop

311
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,445
pointing that gun at me?

312
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:01,246
The school is safe, thanks
to us.

313
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:03,082
Here's the damn phone.
Well... please, just... if

314
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:04,984
you could just get away from the
school.

315
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,618
Get away from the children.
Hey!

316
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,053
Just-just stay away from the
children.

317
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,588
Have a good day, sir.
Thank you.

318
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,856
Have a good day.
Go.

319
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,391
We're leaving!
We're leaving, we're leaving.

320
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:14,893
We're leaving.
You know, Charlie, if we

321
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:17,663
can't be in the school zone,
maybe we need to train somebody

322
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:20,366
who can be.
You know, someone you'd never

323
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:25,437
suspect could stop a shooter.
I got an idea.

324
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:37,449
And here we are, Dee, at a
gun show, huh?

325
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,252
Lowest common denominator.
Is that a bazooka?

326
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,187
Insanely dangerous, this
place is.

327
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:44,156
It's crazy.
Oh, look at this guy right here.

328
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:46,291
He'll probably sell us a gun.
Excuse me, sir.

329
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,660
Um, I would like to buy a gun
from you.

330
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:51,330
Something that is unnecessarily
powerful, something you would

331
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:53,599
never need in Philadelphia.
Yeah, ooh, ooh, but you know

332
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,567
what you shouldn't do though,
is look into our very sketchy

333
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,469
pasts.
No.

334
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:59,505
Uh, it's not a problem.
We all got a sketchy past.

335
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,874
Oh, genuine creep. Wonderful.

336
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:04,743
Perfect.
Hey, sir, could you please sell

337
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,712
us this AR-15?
Yeah.

338
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:08,647
Uh, despite, you know, who or
what we plan to obliterate

339
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,616
with it.
And don't ask questions, okay?

340
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,551
No.
'Cause we just want to prove

341
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,653
to our friends how easy it is to
buy a high-capacity rifle.

342
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,588
Absolutely.
All right, man, great.

343
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,091
Hey, so give this guy his 1,500
bucks, and we'll just saunter

344
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:22,027
right out of here with a weapon
of mass extinction.

345
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,962
Three grand.
What? I'm sorry.

346
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,931
That's $3,000.
No, not for this.

347
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,699
No, for this, for this.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

348
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,468
At Gunther's it's $1,500.
Oh, this ain't

349
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,437
Gunther's.
This a price gouge?

350
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:33,372
Oh, my.
That's illegal.

351
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:35,174
Oh, you see, I'm a private
seller.

352
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,975
That means I can do whatever I
want.

353
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,277
Shit.
Fine. That's fine.

354
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,778
We'll buy it, and we'll
return it.

355
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,480
All sales are final.
Come on!

356
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:43,615
I'll show you what's final,
you redneck son of a bitch!

357
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:45,684
I will burn you alive like the
last bitch who crossed me!

358
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,286
Okay, all right, all right,
Dee.

359
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,720
That's not getting us anywhere.
Okay, she's hot.

360
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:50,556
I went... I went hot real
fast; it just happened.

361
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,291
Well, our whole crew's been
hot lately.

362
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,193
We're trying to cool down, but
you're not making it any easier.

363
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:55,727
Mm-mm.
All right, listen, I want

364
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,262
this gun, pal.
Okay, I want it, because it's

365
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:58,797
easy to buy a gun.
And I need to prove that to

366
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,533
some people, so give me the gun
at a fair price, and do it now.

367
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:03,001
$4,000.
Shit!

368
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,504
Four thou...? $4,000?
Really?

369
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,139
I'll tell you what.

370
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:09,708
How about I just take it, huh?
'Cause I'm a maniac with a

371
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,511
gun, and there's nothing you
can do about it.

372
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,083
Oh. Oh, oh.
Okay.

373
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,052
Oh, okay.
Oops.

374
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:23,622
Putting the gun down now.
Okay, this is just a... just an

375
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:27,793
exercise, okay, to prove how
unsafe it is...

376
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:31,930
for everyone to have guns, okay?
But I see now that I was the

377
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:35,868
maniac with the gun.
And you all made it safer...

378
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,703
in here.
Yeah.

379
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:41,340
Good for you.
Our bad, our bad for this experiment.

380
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:48,432
Thank you for joining us.
I know you may not see yourself

381
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,939
as a solution to a
national problem.

382
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:54,075
You might not think you have
the ability, but, uh, believe

383
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:56,912
me, you were... you were
carefully selected.

384
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,714
And with a little hard work
and a whole lot of training, we

385
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,716
can help you keep your
school safe.

386
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:04,319
Are there any questions?
Yo, can I get some beer?

387
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,921
No beer.
No. We said it, like,

388
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:07,956
a million times.
Guys, guys, how many times do

389
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,058
we have to be through this?
No beer, okay?

390
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,927
All right, you know, you
can't drink beer and be

391
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,162
effective.
But you guys had, like, five.

392
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:16,398
Don't count beers, Carlos.
Not cool.

393
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,833
Yeah. And by the way, Carlos,
I've had six.

394
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:21,703
And I've had seven.
So don't be a rat, okay?

395
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:24,639
And if you are gonna be a
rat, get it right.

396
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:27,075
No more questions.
In fact, no more questions.

397
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,244
You guys are the ones that
asked for the questions.

398
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:31,813
Shut up, Carlos!
Carlos, shut up!

399
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,615
The time for questions is over.

400
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:36,151
It's now time for learning.
Okay? You're-you're impeding

401
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:38,987
on your own safety.
Okay, now my friend and I

402
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:42,524
have been arguing all day about
the efficacy of swords

403
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:45,293
versus guns.
Okay? So we met in

404
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,162
the middle.
Now if you look under your

405
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:49,798
seat, you'll see that each of
you has been provided a weapon

406
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,867
that you could easily find in
your own classroom.

407
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:56,471
Some of you may have
compasses, others,

408
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,406
sharp pencils.
Okay, there are forks in

409
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:02,043
the cafeteria, there's piano
wire from the music room.

410
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:05,447
You need to learn how to make
every single item in your

411
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,349
school a potentially
life-threatening weapon.

412
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:09,150
Look at the person
sitting next to you.

413
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:11,052
That person wants to take
you out.

414
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,921
Guys, safety is the name
of the game.

415
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:14,856
It's all about safety.
Let's take it slow.

416
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:17,859
We're gonna take this in a
safe and orderly fashion.

417
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:21,496
Are you ready to begin?
Okay.

418
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:24,733
And, guys, let's have
a little fun.

419
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:28,470
Shut it, shut it, shut it!

420
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,438
Those-those kids are maniacs!
Oh, my God, I think they're

421
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,540
all in gangs or something!
There's a lot of score settling

422
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,609
going on in there!
Oh, yeah, dude, we created

423
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,177
a <i>HungerGames-type</i> scenario
in there.

424
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,313
Imagine if they had guns!
Oh, it'd be a disaster!

425
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,081
An absolute disaster!
These kids are all too violent.

426
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,716
It's, like, ingrained in them
or something.

427
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,752
Oh, my God, dude, we've been
singing the wrong tune.

428
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,687
Society is getting more savage.
We need to get the weapons

429
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,522
<i>out</i> of their hands!
Maybe we should call the

430
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:49,157
cops, the only people who should
have guns!

431
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,925
They got to come in here,
they got to calm this down!

432
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,794
Oh! Oh, shit, Charlie, I got

433
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:55,230
to admit something, dude.
I'm bleeding pretty bad.

434
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:58,133
One of the kids got you?
I nicked myself back in the

435
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,168
principal's office just trying
to upholster my weapon.

436
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,037
Jesus, man.
I didn't want to say anything

437
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,672
'cause it was a little bit
embarrassing.

438
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,874
All right, can I go to

439
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,075
the hospital?
Yeah, let's go.

440
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:10,879
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- First

441
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,814
they disarm us, then they
oppress us.

442
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:16,084
So I want you to get
every gun you can buy and bring

443
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:20,655
it to 17th and JFK, and we're
gonna march on City Hall.

444
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:24,526
And bring whatever guests
you want, regardless of age or

445
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:26,561
whatever restriction the
government puts on our

446
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:28,697
expression of beauty.
Just get the guns and bring

447
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,632
them down to City Hall.
Well, you better believe I'll

448
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,334
be there.
I know you'll be there.

449
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,269
Bring your kid.
You have kids?

450
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:37,272
Yes, of course, of course.
Bring them.

451
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:38,840
I mean, come on.
He's really going off the deep

452
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:39,908
end, Dee.
I don't know.

453
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,843
I hate to admit it, Dennis, but
he's got a point, you know.

454
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,812
It doesn't seem like it's all
that easy to buy an assault

455
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:45,447
rifle.
No, no, no, no, no.

456
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,082
Don't you start with that shit,
Dee.

457
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:49,050
Well, I'm sorry.
It is incredibly easy to buy

458
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:51,152
assault rifle, and I'm gonna
prove to you how easy it is

459
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:53,154
right now.
Okay, here comes our guy.

460
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:57,192
Mm, mm. No.
Hi.

461
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:59,427
- Uh, you got my money?
-  You got my

462
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,396
people-killer?
Right here.

463
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:03,431
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
That's the stuff, baby.

464
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:06,634
Now, I got $1,500, which is the
fair asking price.

465
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:10,605
I hope that's okay.
Yeah. Give it to me.

466
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:13,608
All right. There you go.
All right, now, I'm not really

467
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,577
totally comfortable rolling the
window down.

468
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,512
I'm sure you understand why, so
I'm just gonna pop the trunk and

469
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,481
you can, uh, you can throw it
in there, all right?

470
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,149
Back there?
Yeah.

471
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,784
In the trunk?
Yeah.

472
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:24,753
Okay, I got you.
You see how easy that is,

473
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:27,322
Dee?
You just give a man $1,500 and

474
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:29,290
he gives you an assault rifle.
Uh-oh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh.

475
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,259
What? Where's he going?
Well, he appears to be

476
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,927
sauntering off.
Well, don't do... No.

477
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,896
Well, sir, I gave you the
$1,500.

478
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:36,865
Don't saunter away. I'm try...
That's not fair!

479
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,833
No, it's not fair!
You stop right now!

480
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:41,436
Listen, you stop in your tracks!
Uh, Dennis, go stop him.

481
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:44,139
Denni... Go stop...?
The man has an assault rifle!

482
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,107
What am I supposed to do?!
Shit!

483
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,042
I can't buy one!
The only thing that stops a

484
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:51,012
bad guy with a gun is a good guy
with a gun, which we can't get!

485
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:53,348
Goddamn son of a bitch Frank,
you were right!

486
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,116
Frank was right!
Shit!

487
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,688
Where's Frank? We're hot.
We're coming in super hot!

488
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,990
Where is Frank?!
Oh, you guys hot?

489
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,658
You guys are still hot?
The whole thing's hot, man!

490
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,627
Oh, yeah, I'm burning up
right now!

491
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:07,796
It's a crazy situation!
We're on your side now!

492
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:09,931
We got to get these guns off
the streets!

493
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,900
Boo-yah!
Wait, what? No, no.

494
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:13,868
Off the streets?
What are you, crazy?

495
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,970
We need the guns on the streets!
Everyone needs to have guns!

496
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:17,939
We need to flood the streets
with guns!

497
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:19,908
To stay safe.
Aw, shit.

498
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,177
I mean, I think, uh...
You know, I think we crossed

499
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,112
right past each other like ships
in the night, man.

500
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:25,780
We flip-flopped.
Yeah, 'cause we're on the

501
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:27,715
opposite side now.
That side makes no more sense

502
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:29,717
to me.
If we could've just met up,

503
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,019
like, two hours ago...
Oh, oh, there's Frank.

504
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,987
Hey, Frank!
Frank, is that a box of guns?

505
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:34,956
What is that?
Guns? No.

506
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,326
Water filters.
Water filters?

507
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,695
All right, guys, load 'em in.
Very nice.

508
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:42,664
Hey, Frank, why do you have a
truck full of water filters?

509
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,632
Uh, you know what, I don't give
a shit.

510
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,267
Let's get down to that rally,
man.

511
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,569
Rally?
Yeah.

512
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:49,204
Yes, the freedom rally.
The one you organized.

513
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,206
Ooh, shit, I'm not gonna go
down there.

514
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,174
It's gonna be a bunch of nuts
with guns.

515
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,143
Too dangerous.
Wait, hold on a second.

516
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:56,778
What's going on?
I thought you were into guns.

517
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,746
You know, why have you been on
TV talking about all that shit?

518
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:00,715
I bought a stake in Gunther's
Guns.

519
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:02,684
I got everybody angry and
scared.

520
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:04,652
They bought the guns, I made a
fortune.

521
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:06,921
Oh, my God. This is crazy.
So you don't give a shit about

522
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:08,890
the gun issue at all?
Uh, uh...

523
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:10,859
I mean, what the hell?
You're like the NRA.

524
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:12,827
Yeah, a little bit like
the NRA.

525
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:15,330
Little tiny bit.
But I-I think of myself more

526
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,665
like Al Gore.
You know, he got everybody

527
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,535
worked up over global warming.
Then he made millions.

528
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:22,770
Huh?!
Yeah. Everybody does it.

529
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:25,073
Liberals, conservatives, doesn't
matter.

530
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:28,343
This is America: you're either a
duper or a dupee.

531
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:31,379
I'm a duper.
You guys are the dupees.

532
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:35,717
I got to go.
Where you going now?

533
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:38,653
With us now is local
community activist, Frank

534
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,755
Reynolds, with a
terrifying statistic.

535
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:41,756
Frank?

536
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:43,224
Yes. Thank you, Chet.

537
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:44,192
You're welcome.

538
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:49,597
Do you know that 90% of
your water is 100% toxins?

539
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,533
Who knows what the other 10% is?

540
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,501
It's probably far
worse, I would imagine.

541
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:54,469
It's really worse.

542
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:58,172
I have a water filter for you
that you need to put in every

543
00:19:58,174 --> 00:19:59,807
single home.

544
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,477
It will protect you and
your entire family.

545
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,846
You can even give that
water to your babies.

546
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,080
Wow.

547
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:08,016
Well, babies, look out, because

548
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,518
this next segment
is just for you.

549
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,553
Don't turn that channel.

550
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:14,289
Your life may depend upon it.

551
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,490
Got to give it to him.

552
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,258
He is good.
That son of a bitch.

553
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,193
Goddamn.
Yeah.

554
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:21,162
I think I'm gonna get one of

555
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,164
those water filters.
I do kind of want one, right?

556
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,133
For safety, for safety.
I mean, he does make some

557
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,120
good points.
Yeah.

558
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,916
The water's toxic.
I mean, it is. Yeah.

559
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:39,635
