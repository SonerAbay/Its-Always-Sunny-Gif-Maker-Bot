1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:03,648
You lock us in a room

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:05,781
and then we try to escape. That's it?

3
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,348
Yes, that's correct.
People all over the world do this.

4
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,786
We're one of 15 escape room
companies in Philly alone.

5
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,875
Yes, I'm fully aware of this practice.

6
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:15,138
It's a highly sexual
experience for people.

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,706
You'll get no judgments from us.

8
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:20,796
No. No, no, no.
I'm sorry, this is not sexual.

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,711
It's not sexual.
Then I don't know what this is.

10
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:23,799
You've not explained it.

11
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,801
Uh, well,
it's a mystery role-playing game.

12
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:27,890
You solve puzzles in order
to escape from a room.

13
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:30,283
It's really about seeing
how well you work as a team,

14
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:31,807
and it's also a lot of fun.

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,025
- Hmm.
- This sounds very nerdy.

16
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:34,679
- Is this a nerd thing?
- It's definitely a nerd thing.

17
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:36,376
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I don't do nerd things. - No, no, no, no.

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,682
It's not-it's not nerdy. It's not nerdy.

19
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:38,727
It's actually really fun.

20
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,467
That's why I set this whole thing up.
You know?

21
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:41,686
It's fun. I've done one before.

22
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,688
- You've done one?
- With who?

23
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:45,734
- My friends.
- What?!

24
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,387
- What friends?
- We're your friends.

25
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,519
All right, I did it alone.

26
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:49,825
- She did it alone!
- Oh!

27
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,304
Hey, it doesn't matter. It's fun.

28
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:53,132
So wait, wait a minute,
so what's the prize?

29
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:55,265
If we get out of the room,
what do we get?

30
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:57,267
Well, if you escape
before your time is up,

31
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,704
we will put your team
photo on our website.

32
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,358
- Just the picture?
- That's it? - Just the picture.

33
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,707
- That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
- And it's not sexual?

34
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,056
- I'm out. I'm out.
- Come on. Why does

35
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,754
there have to be a prize?
Why does it have to be sexual?

36
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,930
Why can't men just do something
for the challenge of it,

37
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:08,844
'cause it's fun?

38
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:10,976
Men don't do things just to do them.

39
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,978
Okay? We're busy running the world,

40
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:14,545
- providing for our families. All right?
- Exactly.

41
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,722
We need stakes.
If there's no stakes, what's the point?

42
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:18,941
That's a good idea, though.

43
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:21,987
How about if whoever wins,

44
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,511
you buy them a 20-ounce sirloin steak?

45
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:25,861
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

46
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:28,298
- That could be fun.
- As a man, that makes sense.

47
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,908
- Well, okay, yes.
- Different.

48
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,736
Absolutely.
Then it becomes a game.

49
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,216
You see, I get out of the room.

50
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,957
That means I win the game,

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,523
the lady here,
she takes me out for a steak,

52
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,743
- and then it becomes sexual.
- Nope. No.

53
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,876
That's not how it works.
So you have to win as a team...

54
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:42,747
You know what? Don't explain it anymore.

55
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,879
Challenge accepted.

56
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:46,838
_

57
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,194
Ooh, hoo, hoo, this is gonna be so good.

58
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:08,456
Whoa, they really went all-out.

59
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,415
This might actually be kind of fun.

60
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,851
- Aah! Whoa, ho, ho!
- Oh, Dee!

61
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:14,288
- Whoa, what...
- Guys, guys, guys, I found something.

62
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:15,420
What are you screaming at, Deandra?

63
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:16,334
You didn't even find it.

64
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,774
It was right there on the table.

65
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:19,467
Greetings and salutations,

66
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,556
- Detectives.
- Who's that broad?

67
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,776
It's Amanda from before.
She's just doing a bad British accent.

68
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:25,995
A tuppence to you, Amanda.

69
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,345
- Oh, now she's gonna do it.
- Doth thou...

70
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:29,260
Give me this, 'cause you can't...

71
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,566
All right.
Yeah, Amanda, um, if you do that accent,

72
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,874
- then Dee's gonna want to do it, and we hate that.
- Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,310
So w-why don't you just go? You go.

74
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:37,224
You have arrived

75
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,487
at 221B Baker Street,

76
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:42,229
home of world-famous... um, excuse me.

77
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:44,275
You're not supposed to
start searching yet.

78
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,668
- I haven't started the timer.
- I didn't.

79
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,017
Oh, yes, you did.

80
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,497
I have cameras all over the room.

81
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,716
I can see and hear everything you do.

82
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,805
Oh, my bad. Okay, I stopped.

83
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:55,024
No, you didn't.
Again, I can see you.

84
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,070
Yeah, um, Amanda, she's not gonna stop,

85
00:02:57,113 --> 00:03:00,029
so why don't you just, um,
uh, speed things along?

86
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:02,293
Oh, u-uh, Holmes is in trouble,

87
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:03,598
- and he needs your help...
- Yeah, faster, faster.

88
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,252
Oh, okay, well, if you need a hint...

89
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:07,254
Yeah, you know what?
Um, we're not... we don't like this

90
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,256
at all. Um, why don't you just
go ahead and start the game?

91
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,107
Okay, fine, your time starts now.

92
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,391
- Oh! We're locked in. Here we go!
- Oh, that's cool.

93
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:14,914
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, she locked the door?
- Yeah.

94
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:16,742
Did you not listen to the whole
setup that the game nerd did?

95
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,903
- That's what the game...
- No, that's-that's no good.

96
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,849
I can't have that. I can't be locked in.

97
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,843
- W-What's the code for the door?
- That's the whole point, Frank.

98
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,657
- We're supposed to work together...
- Shut up, Deandra.

99
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,447
- I can't be locked in here.
- O-Okay, calm down.

100
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:28,878
You know, I was worried
that this might happen.

101
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,364
Frank hasn't been locked
up since the nitwit school,

102
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,713
so he gets a little tight about it.

103
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:33,324
I brought some of that gum
you like, buddy.

104
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,629
You want to chew on that?
Want to chew on that?

105
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,327
It's gonna settle you down.

106
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,111
- That's gonna calm his nerves.
- All right, hey, guys.

107
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:40,091
Uh, let's huddle up.
Guys, listen, listen.

108
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,457
Frank, it's gonna be cool,
man, we can do...

109
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,289
we can totally do this. Okay.

110
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,943
Here's what I'm thinking:
I think-I think we should

111
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:45,727
actually split up into teams,
and then when we find something,

112
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,077
we come... we come back together,

113
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:51,516
and we put... we use the...
collective brain power...

114
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,519
I'm sorry.
Frank, that gum-chewing is insane.

115
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:56,216
- What?
- The chewing of the gum. It's happening,

116
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,696
u-uh, right in my ear. It's ludicrous.

117
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,089
That-that is the most
irritating sound on Earth.

118
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,135
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Guys, guys.

119
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:03,876
I'm thinking that since
I've done this before,

120
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,878
- I should probably quarterback this whole thing.
- Well, I spoke too soon.

121
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,445
That's the most
irritating sound on Earth.

122
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,360
- Yeah, yeah.
- And just, I can-I can walk you guys through

123
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:11,100
how to get clues,
what you're looking for, specifically.

124
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,493
- Why don't you just go find the clues?
- Thanks, Dee.

125
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,234
- Help us out. Thanks, Dee.
- Go, go, go.

126
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,227
- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Dee.
- Great, thanks. - Keep going.

127
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,542
Is she gonna be
doing that the whole time, man?

128
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:20,545
- Like, just chiming in... like, advice, and...
- You know she is.

129
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:21,937
Did-did you hear what she said
about being the quarterback?

130
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:23,591
Does she think she's the leader?

131
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,376
Everybody knows quarterbacks are men.

132
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,508
And honestly, like,
I don't want to say it out loud,

133
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:30,250
- but a female leader? It's just...
- No.

134
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,557
Doesn't sit well, right?
Doesn't sit well with me.

135
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,949
- Gives me chills.
- It feels, like, un-American, maybe?

136
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,908
- Yeah. Bro.
- It's un-American.

137
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,039
- Very un-American.
- Is it? Is it?

138
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,476
Thing is, is like,
we had a vote in America.

139
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,607
- Yeah.
- We almost had one,

140
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,392
and then America was like, "Mm..."

141
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,481
- No women.
- We couldn't have been more clear about it.

142
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:46,919
- Very clear.
- I... I got a plan.

143
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,921
No, no, no, come on, you guys.

144
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,401
No, we're supposed to do this together.

145
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:52,490
We're supposed to do it... Goddamn it!

146
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,143
Ah...

147
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:55,580
so-so much more relaxed
without her in here.

148
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:56,929
That's the move.

149
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,627
Both of 'em. I mean,
the last thing we need is two women,

150
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,063
- "helping us"?
- Oh, I know.

151
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:03,152
Why do you have a lock on
the outside of your door?

152
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:05,067
Uh, well, that's... Don't ask.
You... Look, the point is,

153
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,591
th-there's a lock on the door,

154
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,940
and there's no way Dee's
getting out of there.

155
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,509
All right, so now that we don't have
those ladies squawking in our ears,

156
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,293
let's get back to
doing what men do best,

157
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,816
and we strategize, okay?

158
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,557
So we need to come up with a game plan.

159
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,603
- Yeah? All right.
- Mm.

160
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,953
- Yes. I know exactly what we should do.
- I actually have a good idea.

161
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,433
- Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait, don't interrupt me.
- Here's what we do...

162
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,826
- No, no. We go... No, no!
- Mac, shut up.

163
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,176
- Let me say my idea first.
- No, it's really good, it's gonna get us out of the room.

164
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,395
- I have a great idea.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

165
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,744
Slow down, slow down. Okay.

166
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,529
Clearly, we're gonna have
to designate a leader here.

167
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:33,618
- Oh.
- Oh! Right. - Right?

168
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:34,793
- Of course.
- That's what men do.

169
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,098
What are we... That's what men... Right!

170
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,231
We-we figure out who's, uh, in charge.

171
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:39,537
- Right, exactly.
- That's how things work.

172
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,451
I nominate Dennis.

173
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:42,453
- Oh.
- Yes, because he's the smartest.

174
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,679
- Right, Dennis?
- Uh, I-I am very smart,

175
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,448
and it's not a bad idea
to have me be the leader.

176
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:47,632
Plus, also now that you've said it,

177
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,981
I feel like it can't be unsaid.

178
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:50,635
I wouldn't have said it, but it is true.

179
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:53,333
Uh... technically, Frank is the oldest,

180
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,769
which makes him the smartest.

181
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,424
Yeah, but Dennis is, like,
the smartest person I've ever met,

182
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:58,773
and I've met, like, a hundred people.

183
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,601
Ooh, you know, that is a lot of people.

184
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:01,863
Well, I've met, like 105.

185
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:03,996
- Now, why would you...
- You have not. Where?

186
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,215
- Whatever. Supermarket, mall.
- Charlie knows a lot of people.

187
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,479
- I know people.
- I'll table it, I'll table it.

188
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:10,437
Why don't we break up
into the two teams?

189
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,134
I'll pick my leader,

190
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:13,788
you pick yours,
and we can find our own clues.

191
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,138
Uh, you know what?
That's actually a really great idea,

192
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:18,227
because that creates a more
competitive atmosphere,

193
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,664
- Okay.
- which is more conducive

194
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:22,101
to the problem-solving
abilities of a man. Huh?

195
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,798
- Huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think he's right.

196
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,017
- All right, fine. You and me? Want to split off?
- Okay.

197
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,097
- You and me. Let's go.
- Lose these bozos.

198
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,499
- We need 'em? No.
- All right, we're out of here.

199
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,065
- Come on, follow me. I got a couple ideas, man.
- He might-he might die.

200
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,719
- He might die. Yeah.
- Good luck, suckers.

201
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:35,157
All right. Hey, let's, uh,
let's find some clues, buddy.

202
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,159
Don't worry, Dennis,
I already found one,

203
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:39,597
and I think it's significant.

204
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,599
- Whoa.
- It's a heart-shaped lock.

205
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,601
- Whoa, excellent find, buddy.
- Yeah.

206
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,167
Excellent. Okay, the game is afoot.

207
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:46,386
- All right.
- Yes! Yes.

208
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,735
Let's-let's keep this between us.

209
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,302
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:50,738
- Nice, nice.
- I won't tell them.

211
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,261
I-I'm terrified. I don't feel

212
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,828
like touching anything in Mac's room.

213
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,830
- Hey, don't touch the bike.
- I'm not going near that.

214
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,702
- Okay, all right.
- But we can't let them beat us.

215
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,181
- Frank, Frank, Frank. Frank.
- Just look. We don't...

216
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,661
Look no further.

217
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,837
- 'Cause when I was out there...
- Hmm?

218
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,317
...I already found one.

219
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,275
Great! You didn't-you didn't tell them.

220
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,668
No, I'm not gonna tell them.

221
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:10,062
Because the most important
aspect of a man's success

222
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,543
is to never trust another man.

223
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:14,066
- For sure, yeah.
- Okay, well, w-what is it?

224
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:15,850
- All right, check it out.
- Hmm?

225
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,593
A heart-shaped key.

226
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,029
Oh!

227
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:24,492
Ugh!

228
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,021
Goddamn! Sons of bitches.

229
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,631
Amanda, what's the protocol when a team

230
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,459
locks one of their team
members in another room?

231
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:31,634
I have no idea.

232
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:32,988
This has never happened before.

233
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,297
All right, well,
what are they doing out there?

234
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,473
Not much.
They've basically just been arguing

235
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,258
about which one is in
charge this whole time.

236
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,476
All right, well,
have they found the heart-shaped

237
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,130
- lock and key yet?
- They have, but they

238
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,001
refuse to admit it to one...

239
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,308
Wait, how did you know about that clue?

240
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:49,546
Ooh, yeah, yeah. I've done this
exact same escape room before.

241
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,313
Yeah, that's why I picked it.

242
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:53,186
I wanted to show them that I'm
smart and I can solve stuff.

243
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,818
- By cheating your way through a game you've already played?
- Okay, don't judge me, nerd.

244
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:56,506
All right? I don't need that.

245
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,191
What I need is for you
to get me out there

246
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:00,628
- so I can solve puzzles and be a star.
- Okay, well, again,

247
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,934
this is a team-building exercise.

248
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:05,154
Perhaps if you could tell them
about the lock and the key,

249
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,503
they'd let you out of the room.

250
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:09,202
Oh, yeah, right. I'm sure...
And give them the satisfaction

251
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:11,726
of unlocking it? No, thanks.
Now, come on, sister.

252
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,380
We got-we got to stick together

253
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,295
and solve this problem the way women do.

254
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,297
Let's approach it like women. Right?

255
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,778
Through cooperation we can find
a way to emasculate the men

256
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:22,606
whose attention we're seeking.

257
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,086
I don't feel comfortable with this.

258
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,957
Let's see how comfortable
you feel in five minutes,

259
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,221
when they get frustrated and
start smashing all your shit.

260
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:37,186
It's not in here.

261
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,318
Yeah. Nope. Here either. You now what?

262
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,754
Let's-let's just... let's stop.

263
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:42,409
Let's just... Okay.
We've smashed a lot of things here,

264
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:43,845
and I'm not seeing a single key,

265
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,977
which means the key's
got to be in your room

266
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,545
with Charlie and Frank.
Now... Oh, damn it, Mac.

267
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,026
Stop-stop chewing so loudly.

268
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,375
I'm not chewing anything.

269
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:53,550
Well, I can't think. Okay?

270
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,422
I hear you chewing, and I can't think.

271
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,771
I don't have anything in my mouth.

272
00:08:56,814 --> 00:09:00,253
Oh, Jesus.

273
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,838
That's Frank in the other room.

274
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,345
You know what that is, right?

275
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,000
That's a power play.

276
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,002
Frank's trying to assert
his dominance over me.

277
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,352
It's a classic alpha move.

278
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:15,050
- Oh, my God, it is?
- Yeah. Yeah.

279
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,443
No, no, no. Don't sit. Don't sit.

280
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,923
- Oh, sorry.
- You see,

281
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,795
by constantly chewing so loudly,

282
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,841
he's sending a very clear
message that he is the head cow.

283
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,234
And, as we all know,

284
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,846
the head cow's always grazing.

285
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,634
Aren't all cows female?

286
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,242
Well, that was a metaphor.
Okay, you know...

287
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,466
Mac, sometimes I'm just riffing.

288
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,076
Would you allow me to riff?

289
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,121
As the leader, can I riff? Can I riff?!

290
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,950
- Ye-Yes, yes, yes. Yes.
- All right, so the point is

291
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:48,039
go get me some of that gum.

292
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,390
That was the point you were making?
You want gum?

293
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,305
Well, yes, I need the gum.
It sends a very important,

294
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:55,482
subconscious cue that sets
the tone for pack animals.

295
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:57,701
I need to assert myself to this monkey

296
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,268
so that he'll submit to my will,

297
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,140
and we can win the game and
get the hell out of this place.

298
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,491
I'm so sorry, Dennis.
I'm very confused...

299
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,101
Don't sit down!

300
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:09,278
Yes. Um...

301
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:12,673
Just a clarifying question:
are-are we monkeys or cows?

302
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:14,892
We're whatever the hell
I say we are, okay?

303
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:17,547
I'm just riffing.
Now will you go get my gum?

304
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,679
Yes.

305
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:22,291
Anything?

306
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,293
No. Nothing.

307
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,643
Well, keep smashing,
because whatever lock

308
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,472
goes on the end of this key has
got to be in here, somewhere.

309
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:32,083
I've smashed everything,
I can't find it.

310
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,215
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Super great.

311
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,564
- Super awesome, dude.
- Yeah. Really good.

312
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:35,957
Super great.
We're finding all sorts of cool stuff.

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,872
You know, probably gonna be
out of this room in no time.

314
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,090
My leader's killing it over here.

315
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:40,657
- You touched the bike?
- No, I didn't touch your bike.

316
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,093
Didn't touch a thing in
here that was yours, man.

317
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:43,138
Didn't touch one of your gross things.

318
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,879
- What's up?
- Nah. You guys cool?

319
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,576
- Yeah, we're cool. What's up with you?
- Huh? We're good.

320
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,012
- I'm so cool.
- What do you want?

321
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,753
- What do you want? What do you want?
- Yeah, what's up?

322
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,146
- What do you want?
- What's up? What's up?

323
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,148
- Dennis wants some gum.
- Oh, all right. Hang on a sec...

324
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,454
- No, no. Don't do that.
- What?

325
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:55,759
- That's a power play, Charlie.
- It is?

326
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:57,326
- Yeah.
- How is it a power play?

327
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,334
It's a power play.
Everybody knows that the head cow

328
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,416
is always grazing.

329
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,375
- Oh, that's true.
- Wait, so that's, like, a real thing?

330
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:04,115
- Yeah. That's what it is.
- Makes sense. If you're a top cow, what,

331
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,161
- are you gonna not eat?
- Now, I'm sorry, we can't help you.

332
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:08,337
A-All right. Well... I have info.

333
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,469
All right, well, what's your info?

334
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:10,905
First, give me some gum for Dennis.

335
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:12,776
Oh, hardball, huh?
Okay, I'll tell you what.

336
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,038
No, no, don't, don't, don't...

337
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:16,302
I'm gonna give you one shred.

338
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,395
- Ooh! Oh, not cool dude!
- Oh, I knew he was gonna do that.

339
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:24,571
I just didn't want to feel
weak in front of Frank.

340
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,355
I-I want to be a big-deal cow, too.

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,617
Well, now I want to be a big-deal cow,
and I want gum.

342
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,750
But don't eat all my gum, Charlie.

343
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,491
All right, well, what's your info?
What'd you find out?

344
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,449
- I found a clue.
- What is it?

345
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,190
Give me some more gum for Dennis.

346
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,626
- No. I don't trust you.
- Why not?

347
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,498
'Cause you're just gonna put it
in your mouth and eat it again.

348
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,716
I won't. I promise.

349
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,371
Mm. His neck is high.
Makes me trust him.

350
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,461
Good posture, bro. Okay.
All right, I trust you.

351
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,421
- Ooh!
- Aah!

352
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:50,640
- I knew he couldn't be trusted.
- Oh, not cool, man.

353
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,382
Never trust another man
in a negotiation, that's textbook.

354
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:54,731
Art of the Deal. Art of the Deal, bro.

355
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,429
Oh, you tried to tell me that.
All right, Art of the Deal.

356
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,952
Art of the Deal, Art of the Deal.

357
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,301
Hey, look,
we're getting somewhere, right?

358
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,955
We're in negotiation. That-that's good.

359
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:02,870
- That's good, men being men.
- What do you got?

360
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,785
All right, well,
tell-tell us what the clue is.

361
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,439
Why would I tell you?
You already gave me what I want.

362
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:07,788
Because we both know
what Dennis'll do to you

363
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:10,399
if you come back empty-handed...
He will scratch you silly, Mac.

364
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:13,620
Killer negotiation, man.

365
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:15,491
- Holy shit!
- Yeah. Pretty sweet, right?

366
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,781
- Art of the Deal.
- Art of the Deal.

367
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,320
- He was lying.
- So what's up, what'd you find?

368
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,236
I got this.

369
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:25,109
I think it's time for a summit.

370
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,249
Thank you for coming to my summit.

371
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,642
Well, it's not your summit.
It's everyone's summit.

372
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:36,817
That's what a summit is.

373
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,515
The point is we're here to discuss

374
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,561
the terms of your surrender.

375
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,867
Our surrender?
Why would we surrender to you?

376
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:46,000
We know you have the heart-shaped lock.

377
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:48,437
Goddamn it, Mac! You told them?!

378
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:49,569
Ooh!

379
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:50,613
And we have all the leverage,

380
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:52,702
because we have something you need,

381
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,051
and we're not gonna tell you what.

382
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:55,836
The key?

383
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,100
- Yeah.
- Okay,

384
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,667
so there goes your leverage.

385
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,668
Yeah.

386
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,452
Oh, no, I don't think so.

387
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:06,063
For you cannot open
a lock without a key.

388
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:08,805
And you can't do
anything with just a key.

389
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,417
It appears we're at a standstill.

390
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,944
Yeah.

391
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,294
- Yeah.
- By the way, is anybody else wondering

392
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:23,080
why we haven't heard Dee
make a peep this entire time?

393
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,911
Goddamn it, you guys!

394
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,478
Why is no one answering me?!

395
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't even think they can hear you.

396
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:32,612
Is there a chance your brother would've

397
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:35,876
sound-proofed his room for some reason?

398
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,532
Ugh... Oh, no.

399
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:42,709
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah, there is.

400
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,624
Oh, Dennis, you psychopath.

401
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,610
How long have I been locked in here?

402
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:47,927
What the...

403
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:49,629
Welcome, sexual conquest.

404
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,718
As previously discussed,
you've pressed the button

405
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,502
on the alarm clock,
signifying your permission

406
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:54,851
to begin the game.

407
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,549
- Ew.
- A digital copy of your thumbprint

408
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,725
has been sent as your e-signature

409
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,640
confirming your full consent

410
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:03,294
- for whatever may happen to you.
- Oh, God.

411
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,166
We've also discussed the safe word.

412
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,690
Feel free to use it at any time...

413
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:11,085
but, as we both know,
from your Craigslist profile,

414
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:13,348
you probably won't.

415
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:14,697
Good luck.

416
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,396
Oh! Oh, no!

417
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,746
- Oh, my God. No, no, no.
- Remember,

418
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,661
- Come on, Dennis.
- if you're having too much fun,

419
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:23,706
- it ruins it for me.
- Wh...

420
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,578
Ah, ah, ah.

421
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,667
You didn't say the safe word.

422
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,146
Goddamn it, Dennis.

423
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,626
This is insanely disturbing.

424
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,671
All right, you do it for a living.

425
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:33,411
Get off your high horse.

426
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,110
- Dennis! Oh, no.
- Okay, okay,

427
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:37,894
maybe I can help you
unlock the door after all.

428
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:40,244
What do you see in the room?
What's the first clue?

429
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,811
No, no, you don't get it.

430
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:43,683
There's no going out that door,
all right?

431
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:46,120
I-I know my brother
better than anybody else.

432
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:47,991
The fact that his prisoner cannot escape

433
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:49,558
is really what's getting him off.

434
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:53,649
Without that safe word there's
only one way out of this room.

435
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,217
And that's doing something drastic.

436
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,457
And no decision upon us.

437
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:06,828
So I will tarry forth with
what we've said about...

438
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,918
Oh, gentlemen, uh, gentlemen, if I may.

439
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,965
As your newly elected speaker,
I'd like to start by saying

440
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:15,532
I henceforth relinquish any possibility

441
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,752
of becoming team leader from myself.

442
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:20,973
So long as I am able to
retain this excellent title,

443
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:22,975
as speaker of the tribe.

444
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,672
Uh, do we all agree to these terms?

445
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,239
Uh, yeah.

446
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:31,244
Then, as the time in the game
is drawing close to an end,

447
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:33,724
as is the flavor of our gum,

448
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:36,945
I shall commence with the terms
we've all discussed posthaste.

449
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,991
As we all know, we men possess

450
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:42,429
both the lock and the key.

451
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,085
The turning of said lock and
key shall give us the code

452
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,088
to open that door and
render us victorious.

453
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:53,928
The turner of said key should
and shall be our team leader.

454
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,094
So the election of this leader

455
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:58,924
is our top priority at this time.

456
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:03,145
Followed only by the power dynamic

457
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,105
that falls underneath this leader.

458
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:11,110
And then, lastly,
there is the matter of meat,

459
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:15,331
and who among us
gets to graze upon it.

460
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,232
Too far?

461
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:23,122
I'll dial it back a bit.
I'll dial it back a bit.

462
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,472
- Back up.
- That's very good.

463
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,256
Frank...

464
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,042
as the purchaser of the meat
upon our imminent victory,

465
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:33,741
you have offered to award
each one of us with our own

466
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,310
20-ounce sirloin steak,

467
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:39,931
provided you bite yours first.

468
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,053
Is this correct?

469
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:42,706
Correct.

470
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,709
Now, Dennis,
as the possessor of the lock,

471
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:47,929
albeit through unscrupulous methods,

472
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,976
let us not have another scratch.

473
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,935
You shall bite your steak second,
followed by Mac,

474
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,937
the original finder of the lock.

475
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:00,768
And lastly, me,
for I picked the shortest of the straws.

476
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,119
It was unfortunate,
but you were all kind enough to grant me

477
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,861
the speaker position as to
stop the incessant arguing

478
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:09,951
that took place upon
the picking of the straws.

479
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,083
Yeah.

480
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,606
Do we all agree to these terms?

481
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:15,522
Very good. Very good.

482
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:18,090
Then, gentlemen, on the count of three,
we shall dispense

483
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,528
of our chewables and commence
with the turning of the key.

484
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,965
One...

485
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,533
two...

486
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:28,143
three.

487
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:30,754
Gentlemen, I will remind you

488
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,149
that time is of the essence.

489
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,645
Very good.

490
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,766
Frank, the lock and the key.

491
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,987
But before he opens it,
I'd like to take a brief moment

492
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,076
to recognize our
excellent work as men...

493
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,352
Mm.
- navigating these difficult waters

494
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,319
with ethics, with grace,

495
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:54,648
with minimal violence.

496
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,607
But, above all, without compromise

497
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:01,568
to our masculine identity
by any admission of guilt,

498
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:04,005
failure or weakness.

499
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,181
Hear, hear.

500
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,793
Ah, to us as men.

501
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:12,144
Ah, to us as men.
Frank, uh, lead us to our victory.

502
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:14,059
Men.

503
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,279
Hmm.

504
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:19,194
- There's something inside.
- Uh...

505
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:20,420
What is it? What is it?

506
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:22,221
- A note.
- Ah!

507
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,777
What does the note say?

508
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:29,726
"And so the game begins."

509
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,904
What?!

510
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:37,821
I-I think this is only the first clue.

511
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:41,956
Oh, oh, shit. There's a whole
shitload of instructions

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,827
- on what to do next.
- No, no, no.

513
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:46,091
- Next? H-How many things do we have to do next?
- Yeah, what is that?

514
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,658
- Well, well, 20, 30...?
- Uh...

515
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,269
There's like a hundred in there.

516
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:52,401
- Oh, shit.
- 20, 30? How much time do we have left?

517
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,186
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Two minutes.

518
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,448
- Two minutes?
- Two minutes.

519
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:57,058
- We don't have time to do all those things.
- Oh, no!

520
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,449
Frank, Frank, you're in charge.
What do we do?

521
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:00,453
- I don't know what to do!
- You assholes!

522
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:02,063
- Let me in!
- Holy shit.

523
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,891
- Dee's out on the ledge.
- She got out of your room.

524
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,414
- Clever girl.
- Dee! - Come on!

525
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,417
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Let me in. I can help you.

526
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,897
- Dee... - I can get you out of there!
- Dee, be careful.

527
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,072
- That ledge is really small.
- Just let me in.

528
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,075
Stop! Stop the game!

529
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,424
She's gonna fall! Let her in!

530
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:16,555
You guys, you have to...

531
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,910
Oh, shit!

532
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:24,694
I am so sorry that this happened to you.

533
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:26,305
We've never had an injury before.

534
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,133
Well, I'll sue the shit out of them,
Amanda.

535
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm gonna do it. I hate them.

536
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,919
Okay? I-I...
If they just would've listened to me.

537
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,703
- I knew how to help them get...
- Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!

538
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,531
- Oh, there she is! There she is!
- Hey!

539
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,757
- Oh, my God. Woo!
- Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!

540
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,754
- There's our girl.
- Oh, yeah. Hey, guys.

541
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,756
Yeah, Dee, you outsmarted them.

542
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,236
- You won the game.
- Yeah.

543
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,889
You took a fall for the boys.

544
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,913
A-And you know what?
That's what a quarterback does.

545
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:50,981
Sacrifices his... or her...
body for the team.

546
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,331
- You really were the quarterback.
- I was...

547
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,333
- I was the quarterback, right?
- Absolutely.

548
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,248
Yeah, you sure were.
Yeah, no, you figured out

549
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,163
the only loophole in
my carefully curated

550
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:00,339
and well-researched bondage facility.

551
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,341
You're the only person
who's ever done that.

552
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,517
- Really?
- Yeah, the only one. The only one.

553
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,041
Yeah, game nerd. Now, take the picture.

554
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,130
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, y-you said

555
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,915
if we worked as a team and
we escaped from the room,

556
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,396
- then you would take our photo for your website.
- Yeah.

557
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,006
But you didn't work as a team.

558
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,138
- Yeah, no, no, yeah-yeah, we did.
- Yeah, yeah.

559
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,358
Yeah, absolutely we did,
'cause we-we got

560
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,489
- out of the room.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

561
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,143
Yeah, because I let you out.

562
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,146
Oh, yeah, but it was
before the timer went off,

563
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,367
and you didn't specify how we get out,
just that we get out.

564
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,412
- Yeah, that's on you, really.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

565
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,718
- That's not on us. Okay?
- Yep.

566
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,023
- Take the picture.
- I don't see the problem here.

567
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,155
Just take the picture.

568
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,374
- Okay.
- Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait!

569
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,984
Wait, before you do that.

570
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,160
- Uh, Frank got steaks.
- Yeah. - Steaks for everybody.

571
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,335
- Oh! Steaks.
- Yay!

572
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:43,512
Yeah, everybody gets one, but Dee...

573
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,298
you get to bite first.

574
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,343
Oh, wow.

575
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,217
Thanks, guys.

576
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,219
All right, take the picture, loser.

577
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:55,394
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go, let's go.

578
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,179
One, two, three!

579
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,050
Cheese!

580
