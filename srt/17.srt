00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,103
[ mac ]
hey-o! What is up, bitches?

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,772
[ dee ] I'm trying to
revamp my myspace page,
but dennis keeps criticizing...

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,774
Every move
that I make.
What is that?

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,610
What in the hell
is a myspace page?
It's, like, that friends forum.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,546
These things are pretty awesome.
You create a profile,
put your picture on there--

6
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,882
Other people send you pictures
and want to be your friend.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,818
Oh. So that's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.
You guys are losers.

8
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,854
How are we losers, dude?

9
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:25,124
Well, maybe it boils
down to this, smart guy.
Computers are for losers.

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,226
You're drinking a beer
at 8:00 in the morning.

11
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,395
Whatever, dude. Irrelevant.
<i>[ dee ]</i>
<i>holy shit!</i>

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,197
This guy's been
trying to contact me for,
like, two weeks now,

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,233
And I've just been
blowing him off.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,769
But he's saying
that he's our dad.
Awesome. Crazy person.

15
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:40,139
Let me see.
No. Not awesome. Because look
at the pictures he's sending.

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,975
- <i>oh! Oh, look at that!</i>
<i>- see?</i>

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,177
That's your mom, dude!
There's, like--

18
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,680
There's, like, a ton of pictures
of this guy and your mom.

19
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,382
Oh, you know what?
He does kind of look
like you, dennis.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,818
Don't jump to
any conclusions here.

21
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,754
This is bullshit!
You guys have two dads,
and I don't even have one.

22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,756
Yeah! That is bullshit!
We don't even have one.

23
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,758
Wh-what are you talking about?
You have a father.

24
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,695
Yeah. But he's in prison.
He's been there my whole life.
It doesn't count.

25
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,697
That does count!
I never met my father!

26
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,899
Take it easy, all right?
This guy's not our dad.

27
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,001
I don't know.
This is really
freaking me out.

28
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,670
Look, dee,
this guy can't be our dad.
That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,107
Is it?
Is it any more ridiculous
than our dad having brown eyes,

30
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,010
Black hair and being 4'10"?

31
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,118
This is really
a nice place.

32
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,254
It's about time you kids
show me some respect.

33
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,256
It doesn't really have
anything to do with respect.

34
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,159
We just wanted to take you
to a fancy place so that
you would behave yourself.

35
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,562
- yeah, yeah.
- we need to talk to you
about something, dad.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,998
- shoot.
- it's kind of disturbing.

37
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,002
You two aren't banging,
are you?

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,505
What?
No! What are you
talking about?

39
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,940
- that's disgusting.
- yeah. Yeah, it is.

40
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,411
Stay away from that
kind of thing. No good
can come of it. Trust me.

41
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,681
That's not what
we're here to talk about.
<i>It better not be,</i>

42
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,883
Because I don't want no--
[ grunts ] grandkids.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,454
- I am not banging my sister.
- jesus christ!
What have I walked into here?

44
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,757
- oh, my god.
- you two aren't
having sex together?

45
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,627
No, we're not
having sex together.
What the hell is she doing here?

46
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,631
-sit down, please, mom. Sit.
-I am not getting pulled into
any sort of perverted sex talk.

47
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,701
- it's not perverted.
- banging your sister
is perverted, dennis.

48
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,003
I am not banging my sister!

49
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,442
[ sighs ]
god!

50
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,912
Can you just sit, please?
Please sit in the chair.
Please sit in the chair.

51
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,020
Frank.
Barbara.

52
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:12,491
Your turkey neck is looking
exceptionally attractive
this evening.

53
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,627
You have turned into
a retarded person.
You're a retard.

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,397
Can we use
some adult language,
just for a couple minutes?

55
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,501
Let's get to it.
There's this guy bruce
who contacted dee on myspace,

56
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,570
And he's claiming to be
our biological father.

57
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,673
We just wanted to ask
the question and just get it
out of the way.

58
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,675
Is there a chance that
that could be possible?

59
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,677
No.
Yes.

60
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:36,815
What?
Well, bruce who?
Bruce mathis?

61
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,085
- yeah.
- then, yes.

62
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:44,056
- there's a chance this guy
could be our father?
- no. Yes, he is your father.

63
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,091
What the hell
are you talking about?

64
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,193
Do we really have to
get into all of this?

65
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,896
- my god! Yes.
- yes, we really have to
get into all this!

66
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:55,267
Everybody settle down.
It's not the end of the world.

67
00:03:55,335 --> 00:04:00,939
A long time ago, I met bruce
and we had this little affair,
or whatever you want to call it.

68
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,843
Long story short,
he got me pregnant,
and I had to make a decision.

69
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,347
Seeing as he had no money,
I decided that the best thing
for everyone...

70
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:12,618
Was if I didn't tell bruce
and let your father think
that the twins were his.

71
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,187
End of story.

72
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,623
End of story?

73
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,092
How could you do that?

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,196
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you rather
I had them aborted?

75
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,666
- children, would you
like to have been aborted?
- <i>I can't believe this.</i>

76
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,536
I just can't believe this!

77
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,538
Okay, dad.
Keep your voice down.
You whore!

78
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,473
Keep it down, okay?
Please don't make
a scene.

79
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,475
Don't make a scene.
Sit back down.

80
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,477
Oh, no! I'm not gonna
make a scene!

81
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,646
I was just told,
excuse me,

82
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,649
That my horrible,
whore wife...

83
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,752
Has tricked me into
raising two bastards...

84
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,622
For 30 years,
and I'm being asked
to not make a scene!

85
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,661
Whoa! Oh, excuse me?
Oh, did you bang my wife?
Huh?

86
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,663
Did you bang my whore wife?

87
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:02,668
Does anybody here have
any illegitimate children
with my whore wife...

88
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,304
- that I should know about?
- jesus, frank!

89
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,373
Jesus! Jesus, frank!

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,343
Jesus, frank!
Jesus, frank!
Jesus, frank!

91
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:16,448
Jes-- oh! Jesus, frank!
My life is a lie!
My life is a lie!

92
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,651
Somebody's got to get stabbed!
Somebody's got to get sta--

93
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,654
No--
sta-- sta--
[ grunts ]

94
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,161
Let's get out of here.

95
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,466
[ mac ]
so, dad.

96
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,468
Kind of a funny story.

97
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,905
Turns out my friends got
some weird news the other day
about their biological father,

98
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:44,343
And it got me to thinking,
uh, about maybe, you know,
reconnecting with mine.

99
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,213
Uh-huh.

100
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,317
And, you know,
charlie never had a father.

101
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,087
And, uh, I thought that
maybe the three of us...

102
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,556
Could all become, like--
like, friends or something.

103
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,726
Really? Well, okay.

104
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,862
I'll tell you what.
Maybe I got something for you.

105
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,765
- it's a father-son
type of thing, huh?
- yeah.

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:12,771
You see, I got a little
business I been running in here
the last couple of years.

107
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,542
I was thinking of expanding,
and I'm gonna need some people
on the outside.

108
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:21,647
Some really badass,
tough guys.

109
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,649
I like where
you're going with this.

110
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,453
I think you came
to the right place.

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,389
What do you guys
know about...

112
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,059
Smuggling heroin
through your anus?

113
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,532
[ mac ]
you definitely look good.
That's not what I'm saying.

114
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,335
<i>I just think you need to</i>
<i>tuck it in in the back.</i>
<i>In the back?</i>

115
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,438
Yeah. You button
the top button and then
they tuck it in in the back.

116
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,440
It is tucked in the back.
Is it?

117
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,442
Is it bunchy?
It's not bunchy.

118
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,911
Let me see.
That's exactly it.
How do I look?

119
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,714
That's gonna impress
your dad, right?
It is gonna impress my dad.

120
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,817
You piece of shit!
You no-good piece of shit!

121
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,053
Whoa, whoa, frank!
What's going on in here?
What happened?

122
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,656
- I had a minor stroke.
No big deal.
- what's with the gun, dude?

123
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,726
I'm trying to find
the son of a bitch
who fathered my children.

124
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,063
- what? By doing myspace?
- yeah. And I did everything
they said to do.

125
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,299
I put a picture, a profile.
The thing won't tell me
where the bastard lives.

126
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,135
Did you send him
a friend request?

127
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,471
I don't want to be his friend.
I want to shoot him in the face.
Can you help me?

128
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,875
No. You--
yes, absolutely.
But no killing.

129
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,210
- needs to be killed.
- doesn't need to be killed.

130
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,513
He could take
a good ass whupping.
And we're down with that.

131
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,515
Are you crazy?
No, dude!

132
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,517
Give us one second here.
Charlie.

133
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,386
This is our opportunity
to prove to people
that we are to be respected.

134
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,256
No one is more respected
than dudes in prison, right?
Yeah.

135
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,459
And what are dudes in prison?

136
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,362
Hard?
Right. This is our chance
to get hard.

137
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,065
Okay. I just don't know if this
is the best way to get hard.

138
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,067
Of course it is.
This is totally hard.

139
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,069
You want to get hard,
don't you?
I want to get hard.

140
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,938
I want to get very, very hard.
Do you want to shove
heroin into your ass?

141
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,940
I don't want to shove
anything in my ass.

142
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,744
This is the perfect opportunity
to prove how hard we are and not
shove anything into our asses!

143
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,779
What in god's name
are you two talking about?

144
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,515
Frank, we're in.
Great.

<i>This is so weird.</i>
<i>I'm really nervous.</i>

147
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,326
I really hope
he's not an asshole.

148
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,328
I don't think I can handle
two asshole dads.

149
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,964
Are these my beautiful children?

150
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,336
I just-- I can't believe
what a miracle this is
after all these years.

151
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,139
[ both chuckling ]
oops.

152
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,408
You know, I loved your mother
more than I can say.

153
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,579
And I'm sure she had her
reasons, but she never told me.

154
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,715
Yeah. Well, this whole thing
is very strange for all of us.
Yeah.

155
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,418
We've got a lot to catch up on.
Yeah. Tell us
about yourself.

156
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah.
Where to begin, uh--

157
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,323
I met your mom here in,
uh-- in philadelphia.

158
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:48,694
It was just before I shipped off
to alaska with greenpeace.

159
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,964
I do a lot of environmental work
and work with kids.
Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,968
And we were in alaska.
And then we went to africa,
to the sudan.

161
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,003
We-- here.

162
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,340
This-- this is
my adopted family.

163
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,342
Oh.
<i>[ dennis ]</i>
<i>you adopted them?</i>

164
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,111
Yup. In fact, um--
huh.

165
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,548
Hello. Those are your brothers
and sisters.

166
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,252
Your family just got
a little bigger today.

167
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,554
It sure--
it sure did.
You want to know their names?

168
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,724
No. We'll do that later.
We'll do that later because
it's-- it's hard to remember.

169
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,361
Okay, thank you very much.
And anything here,
at all times, is yours.

170
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,363
Anything in my life is yours.

171
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,133
- these are cool speakers.
- yep. They're yours.
Take 'em. Take 'em.

172
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,903
No, no.
I was kidding.
It was just a joke, I think.

173
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,540
But if you want them, just--
uh-- africa.

174
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,642
Yes. Yes, africa.
Right? Sudan.

175
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,644
I went from the sudan--
I was in darfur.

176
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:42,848
We had a water-purification
program there. So much work
to be done there.

177
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,852
And then I-I--
I spent a little time
in afghanistan.

178
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,589
We were doing
a literacy program for women
who were resisting the taliban.

179
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,126
Well, for better or worse,
I came back here
a couple of years ago.

180
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,196
And I think it was for better,
'cause I'm doing this work,

181
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,633
Uh, starting some programs
for sacred cross hospital,
which I think is very promising.

182
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,738
And-- ah!
My story is boring. I--

183
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,873
What about you?
What are your passions?

184
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,908
You know, what are you doing
with your lives?

185
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,044
There's been a lot of--

186
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,714
Oh, so many things
we do.
Phases.

187
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,017
Oh, god.
Where do you begin?
Yeah.

188
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,152
- something like--
- I know. I know. It's--

189
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,388
- a lot of different--
- chapters.

190
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,823
- kinds of--
kinds of things.
- I want to hear anyth--

191
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:29,595
Just tell me chapter one.
Well, a lot of this kind
of stuff, right here.

192
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,597
Yeah.
These guys.

193
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,632
A lot of--
these guys
are important to us.

194
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,302

fall far from the tree.

Hey, you gotta
relax there, frank.

00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,378
Seriously, bro.
You're gonna have
another stroke.

198
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,482
He won't make me his friend.
How am I gonna find him if
he won't make me his friend?

199
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,885
Be patient.
It's a process.
Yeah, bro. Come on.

200
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,920
It's been days.
I got no friends.

201
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,991
- stop saying that.
You have friends.
- I got you. I got this guy tom.

202
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,728
And that crazy woman who claims
we had a one-night stand
30 years ago.

203
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,798
Right, yeah.
Tom doesn't really count though.
He kind of, like, comes with it.

204
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,634
Screw this!
I'm gonna just follow
dennis and dee around.

205
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,070
Sooner or later, they're
gonna bump into this bastard.

206
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,573
And we're gonna just jump him
and beat him over the head
with a baseball bat!

207

Frank, come on.
They're gonna see that
coming a mile away.

208
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,012
Man, we need to be more devious,
more cunning!
Uh, that's not very hard.

That's some weak ass-buster
shit, bro.

destroyed my lineage.
He must be smashed.

211

We're gonna smash him, friend.
We're gonna smash him good.
We know people.

212
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,459
Look, frank, uh,
we know a guy on the inside
we can talk to.

213
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,628
He might be willing to help us
out with the situation here.

- thanks, dad.
- okay. Now, here's how
it's gonna work.

217
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,541

about that, dad.

We don't have anything
in our butts.

anything in our butts.
We're working on that.

But we're still hard.
Yeah. Oh, you should see
how hard we're getting.

Oh, we are getting so hard.
It's, like-- whew!

224
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,296
We actually came by
'cause we need your help.
Yeah.

Let me get this straight.

226
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,038
You come to me empty-handed
and you want my help?

227
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,807
Yeah. And, look, we are really,
really sorry about that, dad.

228
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:26,412
But if you could give us
some advice on how to handle
a certain situation,

229
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,114
Then we promise
we will come back
with our butts filled.

Oh, so filled.
So filled for you.

father so that we can give
him a serious beating.

Oh, we're gonna
kick the crap
out of this guy.

233
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,925
And check it out.
We can't find him.

234
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:44,630
All right. All right.
Why don't you just follow
your friends around for a while?

235
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,266
They're bound to contact him
at some point.

236
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,836
When they do,
just jump him.

237
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,439
Beat him
with a baseball bat.

238
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,442
That's pretty badass.
That could work.

239
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,145
Now, you listen to me.
Do not come back here...

00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,598
No, dude.
We shouldn't do this.
I'm backing out.

288
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,600
You can't back out.
Frank is waiting in the car.

289
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,169
He's gonna be pissed
if we don't finish the job.
Let frank wait in the car.

290
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,238
We owe this to him.
This guy banged frank's wife.

291
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,906
So did you.
Yeah, but it's different.

292
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,908
How is that different?
I don't know, charlie!
Focus!

293
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,678
[ gasps ]
there they are.
Just relax, dude.

294
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,780
He's hugging them.
They're hugging him back!

00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,983

<i>We shouldn't do this.</i>
<i>- we should bash all three.</i>

296
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,185
[ mac ] this is it.
Let's go. You ready?
Don't be a pussy.

297
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,421
Let's go.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,028

299
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,131
Oh. Hi.

300
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,634
Hi.

301
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,537
Can I help you?
Can I help you?

302
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,606
Can I help you?

303
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,776
Can I help you?

304
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,146
Uh, okay.

305
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,652
Um--
[ inhaling, exhaling ]

306
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,158
It's-- it's okay.
It's okay.

307
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,227
I got it.

308
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,167
Have a good night.

309
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,070
What the hell
was that shit?
What did you do?

310
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,539
I freaked out.
You totally freaked out!
You just left me--

311
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,242
I was gonna hit him.
You left me standing there.
I took a picture of the guy.

312
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,277
Hey!
What?

313
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,812
Snap out of it! Okay?
Okay! Yes.

314
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,248
Now we got to think of
something to tell frank.
Okay.

315
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,883
Hey! Look at me.
Yeah?

316
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,952
Ow!

317
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,522
[ inhaling, exhaling ]

318
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,191
Let's tell him the truth.
Let's tell him the truth.

319
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,497
- blood! Blood!
There's so much blood!
- what happened?

320
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,966
We bashed him good!
We bashed him so good!

321
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,535
We bashed him good!
I think we killed him.

322
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:20,272
Drive! Drive! Drive!

323
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,141
[ tires squealing ]

324
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,379
Jesus, children!
This isn't exactly what
mommy needs right now.

325
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,783
No. No, no, no.
Mom, bruce is so awesome. He--

326
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,285
We had the best time
last night.
Bruce is the coolest.

327
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:37,289
We went to this lupus event
last night. Lupus is awesome!
Amazing.

328
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:41,026
You should give bruce
another chance.
[ bruce ] barbara.

329
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:46,065
My god.
You still look amazing.
<i>[ barbara ] wow.</i>

330
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,468
[ chuckles ]
the years have treated you well.

331
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:53,372
I would have thought
living in poverty
for a quarter of a century...

332
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,441
Would have taken its toll.

333
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,810
Well, when father died,
I was left with all that money.

334
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,279
There's only so much
you can give away before
you finally realize...

335
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,281
It's okay to spend
a little on yourself.

336
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,283
On you.
Yeah, on me.

337
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,887
Father? Wealthy?
I never knew.

338
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,057
I guess it never came up.
So you guys ready?

339
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,160
I am!
[ chuckles ]
I'm up for anything.

340
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,397
Okay.
But first things first.

341
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,203
Oh.
Yeah.
Let's just put these on.

342
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,573
One for you.
One for me.

343
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,642
Great.

344
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,446
Okay, let's go spread some joy.

345
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:39,151
Right. Uh--

346
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,420
Ooh. Okay. Um, hey.

347
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,922
Hey, pal.
How-- how you feeling?

348
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,825
It hurts everywhere.

349
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:52,131
Well--
well, it--
everything's gonna be okay.

350
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,334
You don't know that, deandra.
Shut up, mother.

351
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,037
I don't think we should be
lying to the sick children.

352
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,674
I was trying to be encouraging.
What if he doesn't get better?
You're gonna look like a fool.

353
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:05,210
I gotta say I agree with dee.
The kid's gonna die anyway.
What difference does it make?

354
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,179
I can hear you.

355
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,082
Oh, you heard--
well, you know what?
Disregard that.

356
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,218
Yeah. You know, we weren't
even talking about you.
No. No.

357
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:17,289
We were talking about
your sick and dying friend
in the next bed.

358
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,793
Mother!
What are you doing?

359
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,695
Nothing!
Oh, my god!

360
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,031
- you can't steal
the children's medication.
- I'm not.

361
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,067
Let me see in your purse!
Open your purse up!
Don't be ridiculous!

362
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,635
[ dee ] really?
Everything okay over here?

363
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,637
Yes.
A slight glitch here.

364
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:35,240
Um, this is really kind
of bumming me out here.
Yeah, this is not fun.

365
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,877
Yes. I'm not exactly sure what
it is we're trying to prove.

366
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:42,881
We're not
trying to prove anything.
We're just helping the kids.

367
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,351
Who are we really helping?
Yeah?

368
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

369
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,189
Well, listen, it's one thing
to rock out, raise some cash.

370
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,691
But it's a totally different
thing to put our lives at risk.

371
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,761
Oh, yeah. I mean,
there's all these diseases
floating around in here.

372
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,430
Yes. I mean,
how can we help anyone
if we're all getting sick?

373
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,100
- I mean, use your head.
- plus, it's freezing in here.

374
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,535
You think you could talk
to somebody about cranking
the heat up a little?

375
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,271
- this isn't good for us.
- you're not serious?

376
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,341
I don't think it's a lot
to ask to have them turn
the temperature up.

377
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,011
It's easy.
You just push a button
or, like, crank a thing over.

378
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,146
Are you guys getting hungry?
Oh, yes.

379
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,148
I am starving.
Yeah, I could eat.

380
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,717
Is there a cafeteria
in the hospital?
No, come on. Gross.

381
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,020
I'm not eating in
a hospital cafeteria.
That's a good point.

382
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,923
Brucie, do you know a nice
restaurant in the area?

383
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,698
I'm gonna want
those noses back.

384
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,700
Please.
Give it a rest with
that martyr nonsense.

385
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,903
Yeah. Who is he? Patch adams?
You know who never acts
like he cares about kids?

386
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,905
Dad.
Dad.

387
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,875
[ mac ]
all right, buddy.
Baking soda, lube, balloons.

388
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,412
This is how it's gonna go.
I'm gonna jam this
into your rectum.

389
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,615
And then, woo!
Like that, it's gonna expand
in your colon, okay?

390
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,918
It's gonna be that big?
Absolutely. You ready?
Drop those pants.

391
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,953
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

392
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,656
That's a good look.
That's a good look for you.
Where're you headed?

393
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,825
I tell you what, I feel like
a hundred dollars.

394
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:05,731
Ever since you guys beat that
guy up, I got to thinking.
Hey, what am I gonna do? Huh?

395
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,435
Dive into some kind
of depression over this? No.

396
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,704
I'm gonna jump
right back on the horse.

397
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,941
So I contacted that woman
on myspace who claimed that
we had a one-night stand.

398
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,577
Turns out she's single
and ready to go.

399
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,579
Give me some skin.
Good work.

your chances with this daddy.
You're dead to me.

No. Just listen for
a second here, okay?
No. No.

407
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,434
We've had a change of heart.
We've decided to forgive you...

408
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,536
And to allow you
to be our father again.

409
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,606
I'm not into
being your dad anymore.
Don't want to be your dad.

410
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:51,443
Uh, kinda giving you
a second chance here, dad.
Daddy, yeah.

- no. I'm over it.
- you can't be over it.

00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,748
No, no, no.
I'm over it.

He can be over it.
Will you shut up?
What is with you two?

This is my date.
[ mac ] whoa! Wait a second.
I thought...

423
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,548
You were going on a date

stand with 30 years ago.

00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,550
Yeah.
Yeah.
