1
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:04,347
MAC: Dennis, do you have the tickets?

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:05,008
DENNIS: Yes, affirmative.

3
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:06,643
I got the tickets on-line,
and I got the last ones.

4
00:00:06,712 --> 00:00:07,279
Charlie, got booze?

5
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:08,384
CHARLIE: So what do you think?

6
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:10,228
I think that's enough booze to
last the whole movie, right?

7
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:10,829
ALL: Yes.

8
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:11,633
We're good, we're good.

9
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:12,134
Dee, time?

10
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:13,902
SWEET DEE: Uh, we have
just about a half hour.

11
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,538
Precisely, you bitch!

12
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:15,340
I need to know precisely.

13
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:16,044
28 minutes! I'm sorry.

14
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:16,578
28 minutes.

15
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,317
FRANK: Oh, the city
is like a zoo.

16
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,254
I mean, traffic jam like
you wouldn't believe.

17
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,192
Obama's got the whole
thing congested.

18
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,062
Oh, goddamn it, Mac.

19
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,166
I told you there was
gonna be traffic, dude.

20
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,200
I forgot about Obama!

21
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,135
We still have time.

22
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:28,003
We still have time.

23
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:30,173
No, but, dude, traffic's
gonna jam us up, man.

24
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,875
No, no, no, we can
make it, okay?

25
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:32,844
Time for what?

26
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:33,480
Time for what?

27
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:34,181
Where are you going?

28
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,883
We gonna go see <i>Thundergun</i>
<i>Express,</i> man.

29
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,851
You know what I'm talking about.

30
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,052
What the shit is a Thundergun?

31
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:38,887
Are you crazy, dude?

32
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,925
It's, like, the greatest
movie ever made.

33
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,160
It's about this warrior from a
post-apocalyptic underground

34
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:46,099
society who has to travel back
in time to save his lover from

35
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:47,435
an evil robot army.

36
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:48,069
(Frank laughs)

37
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:49,604
Whoo... "No hesitation."

38
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:50,973
"No surrender.

39
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,108
ALL: No man left behind!"

40
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,811
It's only the biggest
movie in America.

41
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,079
Whoa, that sounds the tits.

42
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:56,846
I'm in.

43
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:57,514
No.

44
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:58,014
How? How?

45
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,349
No. You do not have a ticket.

46
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:00,116
Yeah.

47
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,185
You didn't buy me a ticket?

48
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:01,753
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:02,688
What am I? Your daddy?

50
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:04,323
Yeah, I don't just buy
tickets for people.

51
00:01:04,392 --> 00:01:05,124
Yeah.

52
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,258
Well, I'll tell you what?

53
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:07,459
I'll take Deandra's ticket.

54
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:08,426
You don't like action movies.

55
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:09,227
I don't know, Frank.

56
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,062
This is just as much a love
story as anything else.

57
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:14,031
Plus, I hear the guy hangs dong, and
I'm very interested in seeing that.

58
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,732
Me, too.

59
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:15,734
Yeah, yeah, he hangs dong.

60
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:16,267
Mm-hmm.

61
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:17,535
What the hell am I gonna do?

62
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,370
Well, get out of the way,
'cause we gotta go.

63
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,171
Yeah.

64
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,905
The clock's ticking.

65
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:21,905
Let's, let's go.

66
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:22,973
<i>Thundergun!</i>

68
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:53,315
This blows, dude!

69
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:54,216
Drive faster.

70
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:54,984
Drive faster?

71
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,019
Where would you
like for me to go?

72
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm surrounded by cars, Charlie.

73
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,356
It's all these goddamn
immigrants come in to see Obama.

74
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,358
And none of them
have any insurance.

75
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:03,692
That's why they drive so slow.

76
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,660
Why are you even here?

77
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,828
The movie is sold out.

78
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:06,895
I'm gonna scalp a ticket.

79
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,964
Oh, shit!

80
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:10,965
I didn't bring my wallet.

81
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,900
You guys gotta spot
me some dough.

82
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,335
(laughs) I ain't
giving you shit.

83
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:15,102
Oh, I'll sneak in.

84
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:16,069
I sneak in all the time.

85
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,938
I just hope we get there in
time to all sit together.

86
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:18,905
I don't like to split up.

87
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:19,839
Nah, don't worry about it.

88
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:22,009
If we get split up, we'll just
yell over everybody to each

89
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:24,063
other until they get annoyed
with us and switch.

90
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:26,427
You call in a bomb threat,
that would delay the picture.

91
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,948
That would be very <i>Thundergun.</i>

92
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,865
<i>We're gonna have to do
something drastic if Dennis</i>

93
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,040
<i>doesn't figure out a
way to drive faster.</i>

94
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,720
<i>Yeah, come on, man.</i>

95
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,355
<i>Where would you
like for me to drive?</i>

96
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:34,214
<i>He misses all of his angles.</i>

97
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,811
<i>Well, you can slide
in front of that Prius.</i>

98
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:36,710
<i>Go in front of that Prius.</i>

99
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,541
<i>Oh, okay, so then I'll be
stuck in front of the Prius</i>

100
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:39,772
<i>instead of right
next to the Prius.</i>

101
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:40,958
<i>It's a bigger problem
than that guys.</i>

102
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,472
<i>He's slow at everything.</i>

103
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>You should see how long it
takes him to bang chicks.</i>

104
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,035
<i>Mac, that's because you
always try and barge in so you</i>

105
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:46,969
<i>can see the chicks naked.</i>

106
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,938
<i>And then I have to start the
process all over again.</i>

107
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:51,241
<i>But you waste so much time
talking to them when you should</i>

108
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:51,877
<i>be plowing them.</i>

109
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:52,710
<i>No, you don't get it, dude.</i>

110
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,464
<i>You don't get what I'm...
Look, I'm forging a connection</i>

111
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:58,173
<i>with these women that will yield
for them the most awakening and</i>

112
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,382
<i>unforgettable sexual
experience of their lives.</i>

113
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:00,916
<i>Whatever!</i>

114
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:02,150
<i>I don't care about any of this!</i>

115
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,151
<i>We're gonna miss the movie!</i>

116
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,752
<i>Yeah, come on.</i>

117
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,220
<i>Hey, Thundergun
it up on the curb.</i>

118
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,221
<i>Yes, go on the curb!</i>

119
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,388
<i>Thundergun it
all the way down.</i>

120
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:08,223
<i>Thundergun's not a verb.</i>

121
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,224
<i>Stop using it as a verb.</i>

122
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,058
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

123
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:11,092
<i>It's the man's name.</i>

124
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,193
<i>Just calm down. We'll get there.</i>

125
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:13,261
<i>Well, I tell you one thing.</i>

126
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,963
<i>I could walk faster
than we're moving.</i>

127
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,136
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

128
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:21,937
<i>Oh, wait!</i>

129
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,873
<i>Get back here, you
sons of bitches!</i>

130
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:23,993
<i>(car horn honking)</i>

131
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:25,925
<i>Thundergun leaves no man behind!</i>

132
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,245
<i>We'll come back for you!</i>

133
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:30,346
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

134
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,347
<i>Come on!</i>

135
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,349
<i>(horn honking)</i>

136
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:39,088
<i>(horns honking)</i>

137
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:39,923
<i>Damn.</i>

138
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:40,390
<i>Please.</i>

139
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,191
<i>Shit.</i>

140
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,358
<i>All the streets are blocked.</i>

141
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,826
<i>Hey, let's ask this cop.</i>

142
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,061
<i>Excuse me, Officer.</i>

143
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,462
<i>Uh, we need to get through.</i>

144
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:47,396
<i>I can't help you.</i>

145
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,331
<i>The street's closed down
all the way to Spring.</i>

146
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,733
<i>Yeah, but this
is an emergency.</i>

147
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:51,967
<i>It's not my problem.</i>

148
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:52,902
<i>You gotta go around.</i>

149
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,471
<i>(grunts) All right, we gotta
find a new point of entry.</i>

150
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,206
<i>Attack the target from
a different angle.</i>

151
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,007
<i>Whoa! Hold on.</i>

152
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,475
<i>What are you talking
about attacking?!</i>

153
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,610
<i>No, no, no, we're not
terrorists or anything.</i>

154
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,814
<i>We're just... We're trying to get
to a movie, Thundergun Express.</i>

155
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:05,848
<i>Oh,</i> <i>Thundergun Express,</i> huh?

156
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:06,949
You better get going.

157
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:09,185
You don't want to miss one
second of that movie.

158
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:10,287
Is it that good?

159
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,889
It's the best goddamn movie
I ever seen in my life.

160
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,191
(all groan)

161
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,092
Dude, hangs dong.

162
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,927
I told them that!

163
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:17,694
I told them!

164
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:18,996
I don't want to miss that!

165
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,597
All right, maybe we take a cab.

166
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,398
What about that?

167
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:22,766
A cab? Dee, don't be a fool!

168
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,001
We'll never get a cab out here.

169
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,903
Plus, we'll just sit in
traffic like everybody else.

170
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:27,437
Yeah, we'll be
stuck like Dennis.

171
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:28,338
(trolley bell dings)

172
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:29,406
The trolley!

173
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:30,106
The trolley.

174
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,107
We can make it, Frank!

175
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:31,741
Come on!

176
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,642
Yes.

177
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,810
No surrender, baby!

178
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,680
Come on! Come on, Frank.

179
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:37,347
I'm coming.

180
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:38,581
Come on. You can make it.

181
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,149
I'm coming.

182
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:40,517
No, no, no, no, no!

183
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:41,918
I'm not gonna make it.

184
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:43,086
No, hop off!

185
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:44,788
Hop... Don't leave me here!

186
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:47,925
We'll come back for you!

187
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:50,395
You bastards!

188
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,312
(horns honking)

189
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,570
"You take too long.

190
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,659
You take too long, Dennis."

191
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,584
Screw you, Mac.

192
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,499
I don't take that long.

193
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,659
I'll show you who
takes too long.

194
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,095
Son of a bitch.

195
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,222
Let's see.

196
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:12,170
We got Amanda, we got Brenda.

197
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:13,588
Ah, Alison.

198
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:17,447
Let's find out if Alison thought
that I, that I took too long.

199
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:20,357
ALISON: Too bad the museum
is closed on Wednesdays.

200
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:21,174
I know.

201
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:23,873
I guess we can hang out here and
get to know each other instead.

202
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:25,163
That's a good one.

203
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:25,964
(clicking)

204
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,199
What's with all the locks?

205
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:30,969
I want you to feel safe.

206
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,172
(tape fast forwarding)

207
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,943
So your father took off when
you were pretty young, huh?

208
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,511
That must have been difficult.

209
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,213
Yeah, I could probably speed
things up a little bit.

210
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:43,215
I mean...

211
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,095
Thanks very much.

212
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,329
Careful now. There you go.

213
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:51,263
Watch your step, ladies.

214
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:52,230
Very good. Thank you.

215
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,800
Hey, guy, can you...
can you take me up the river?

216
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,467
I gotta get a mile up the river.

217
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:57,335
Tour is $15.

218
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,736
I left my wallet at home.

219
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,006
I only got a, I got a
quarter to my name.

220
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,173
Look, I can't help you, pal.

221
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:02,940
All right, folks.

222
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:03,741
Everybody, take your seats.

223
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,509
I'll be right back.

224
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:05,744
We'll get this tour
underway, okay?

225
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:06,511
Hang in there.

226
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,547
I swear, I'll take care of
you when I get up there.

227
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,883
Sorry, dude.

228
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:16,523
Hi, I'm your new captain, Frank.

229
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,392
I'm gonna take you
up the river, okay?

230
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,493
Here we go.

231
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,428
What happened to Captain Tom?

232
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:24,697
Uh, Captain Tom turned out
to be a goddamn junkie!

233
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:25,431
Hang on.

234
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:28,366
(passengers gasp)

235
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,972
You, uh, you're going too fast.

236
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:35,973
Huh?

237
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,208
Too fast.

238
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,442
It's the, it's the fast tour.

239
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,978
It's the quick one.

240
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:41,946
Quick tour.

241
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,214
(men speaking native language)

242
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,404
Why aren't you telling
us what anything is?

243
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:46,785
Like what?

244
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,487
What is that
building over there?

245
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,389
Uh, that's a big building.

246
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,458
It's a brick building,
red brick building.

247
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,360
I don't know that
the hell it is.

248
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:58,096
It's a old building.

249
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:59,164
(clamoring in native language)

250
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,866
Can you please use microphone?

251
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:02,801
Very difficult for people
to hear in back, okay?

252
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,337
Oh, oh, the microphone.

253
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,973
Okay. All right. (spits)

254
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:08,640
You hear that?

255
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,176
Yeah.

256
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:10,877
Yeah, okay.

257
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:15,515
Well, we're on the Schuylkill River,
and, uh, it's home to many, uh, weird

258
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,584
fish-like creatures.

259
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:21,987
And also the depository of, uh,
all of the unsolved crimes and

260
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,622
murders in Philadelphia.

261
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:37,868
(group murmuring with interest)

262
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:39,937
Yeah.

263
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:49,449
That trolley kicked ass.

264
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,718
We're just like a couple blocks
from the theater, I think.

265
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:52,419
Yeah.

266
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,254
Thundergun himself would have
been proud of that move.

267
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:55,288
Of course, he'd be proud.

268
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:55,922
We didn't hesitate.

269
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:56,623
We didn't surrender.

270
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:57,090
Yeah.

271
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,591
We did leave a couple
men behind, though.

272
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,225
That's true.

273
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:00,728
But we didn't hesitate to
leave those men behind.

274
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:01,462
Yeah.

275
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,730
Plus, I hung dong
on the trolley.

276
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,297
You guys missed that.

277
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:03,898
No, I didn't miss it.

278
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:04,432
I saw it.

279
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:05,133
I just chose to ignore it.

280
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:05,900
I saw it.

281
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,402
Looked like a button
in a fur coat.

282
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,471
Either way, it was
totally Thundergun.

283
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,807
If Thundergun's dong looks like that,
we should all get our money back.

284
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,475
Yeah, I'm walking
out of the movie.

285
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:14,810
It was more of a ding
than a dong really, Mac.

286
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,146
I got a lot of good ones and thumbs up and...
(car horn honking)

287
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:18,147
Aw.

288
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:18,814
Goddamn it.

289
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,283
Another closure.

290
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,720
All right, think, think.
What would Thundergun do right now?

291
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:24,621
Oh, shit.

292
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,456
Okay, listen, hear me out.

293
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,057
Let's fire down that sewer.

294
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,092
Frank and I do it all the time.

295
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,826
I know my way around.

296
00:08:29,894 --> 00:08:30,726
We'll be over there in a jiff.

297
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:32,027
Uh, I don't know.

298
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,295
Sewer, huh?

299
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:34,797
All right, let's do it.

300
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:35,497
We've come this far, right?

301
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:36,431
Right?

302
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,332
No, no, no, no.

303
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,533
Our clothes will
get soaking wet.

304
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,035
It's going to ruin
the whole movie.

305
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,735
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

306
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:41,536
I know what it is.

307
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,004
He's scared he's going to be too
fat to fit down that gutter.

308
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:43,739
That is what it is.

309
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:44,439
No, it isn't.

310
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:45,207
It has nothing to do with it.

311
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,509
Look, sewers are
disgusting, that's why.

312
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:48,277
Your big fat body is
what's disgusting.

313
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:49,545
And you're embarrassed about it.

314
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:51,448
We are not going in the
sewer, and that is final.

315
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:51,948
(car horn honking)

316
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:52,549
Oh, oh, yeah?

317
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,450
Ah.

318
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,620
Guys, guys, guys, come on.

319
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,788
Don't... goddamn it.

320
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,890
I'm coming through, guys.

321
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,592
Here I come.

322
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,426
Here I come.

323
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:04,361
Oh, wait.

324
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,096
Oh, you know what?

325
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:09,532
It turns out I-I am...
I am too muscular, and I-I can't fit through.

326
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:10,633
Look like you're stuck, huh?

327
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:11,434
Well, yeah.

328
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:13,836
So my-my-my muscles stop
me from gaining access.

329
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:14,971
Sorry, Mac.

330
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,273
Why don't you guys come out, and then...
I'll tell you what?

331
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:18,107
We'll come back for you.

332
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:18,607
Yeah.

333
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:20,343
That's what I told Dennis
and Frank, and I was lying.

334
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:21,110
I know.

335
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,413
So are we...!

336
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,483
You sons of bitches!

337
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:28,619
Oh, you sons of bitches!

338
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,020
You sons of bitches!

339
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,957
Out of the way,
you fat dickhead.

340
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,092
(car horn honking)

341
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:35,827
Thank you. Thank you.

342
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,829
Thank you. Thank you.

343
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,500
No surrender.

344
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,569
No surrender.

345
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:56,515
Shitty bike.

346
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,016
(car horns honking)

347
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:08,559
(rewinds tape)

348
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:09,320
(on tape): You seem cold.

349
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,530
Perhaps you'd be more
comfortable under the covers.

350
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,464
Now, we're talking.

351
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,565
Okay, Alison.

352
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:15,900
All right.

353
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:16,968
Hey, hey, guys.

354
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,203
What are you do...
Mac, can we help you?

355
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,338
Goddamn, Mac.

356
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,507
Oh, oh, I thought I
heard you call my name.

357
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:23,441
I did not call your name.

358
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,843
Oh, okay.

359
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:27,012
Well, I'll be right outside
if you need anything.

360
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,647
We're not gonna need
anything, okay?

361
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,415
If fact, go ahead and
leave the keys in here.

362
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,718
Now I have to re-demonstrate my values,
so that's gonna increase the time.

363
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:33,385
(locks clicking on tape)

364
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,387
I think I need to
be getting home.

365
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,222
My mom is going to
start to worry.

366
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,189
Wait. Your mom?

367
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:39,891
How old are you?

368
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,059
Sixteen.

369
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,026
Sixteen?!

370
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:43,728
No get... what are you...
get... Whoa, shit.

371
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:44,329
That's not good.

372
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:45,230
Why do I still have this tape?

373
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:47,231
That's ridiculous.

374
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,234
(car horns honking)

375
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,102
Goddamn it.

376
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,104
Shit.

377
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:06,284
Well, now, this is an
interesting development.

378
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,455
(mouthing)

379
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:18,429
I gotta say, Charlie, this
sewer is pretty gross, but

380
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,264
it's not nearly as gross as
I thought it was gonna be.

381
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,299
No, it's no bad now.

382
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,434
But like any minute, you know, a
wall of water could just come

383
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,902
gushing through here.

384
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:25,769
So we should keep moving.

385
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:27,471
Wait, wall of water?

386
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,506
Yeah, well, you know,
it's not just water.

387
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:32,543
It's like dog shit and street sludge.
You know, they divert it to

388
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,444
different channels
throughout the day.

389
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:35,011
Oh, my God.

390
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,012
You know, it's sewage.

391
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:36,613
It's sewage.

392
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:36,946
Yeah.

393
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:37,580
Oh, you know what, Dee?

394
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:38,915
Dee?

395
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,617
Can we get naked really quick?

396
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,920
No.

397
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:43,687
Oh, right.

398
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:44,588
Do you mind if I do?

399
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:45,489
Mm-hmm.

400
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,393
Well, see the thing is, like,
if a, if a wall of water comes

401
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:51,096
through, it's actually pretty
sweet to be naked 'cause then

402
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,564
you can hold your clothes up.

403
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,401
You know, and then that piss and
shit just kind of flows over you.

404
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,069
It's more refreshing
than you think.

405
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,005
And then you have dry
clothes afterwards.

406
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:02,375
And it's a lot better than having
the sewage on your clothes.

407
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:03,176
I understand.

408
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:05,244
And I'm a little relieved, but
it's still not good enough

409
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:08,115
for, so I'm going to
keep my clothes on.

410
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:09,850
Oh, look at Queen Dee, who's
too good to get naked with her

411
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,551
buddy all of a sudden.

412
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,586
Okay, I don't...
why are you making it about that?

413
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:13,953
I just... I didn't want...
You know what? t?

414
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:15,588
This is a preposterous
conversation we're having.

415
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,257
This is a functional
conversation.

416
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,658
This is a preposterous
conversation.

417
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:19,359
This is not a sexual thing.

418
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:19,959
You know what?

419
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:20,627
Let's just go.

420
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,228
Let's just go.

421
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:22,028
There's no walls of water.

422
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,229
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

423
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:24,264
Shit.

424
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:25,098
My shoe's stuck.

425
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:25,999
Well, pull it out.

426
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:28,669
If I could pull it out,
would it be stuck?

427
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:29,436
Take your shoe off.

428
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,439
I'm not going to take my shoe
off and walk around barefoot in

429
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:32,707
this disgusting sewer.

430
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,776
Oh, the queen again, everyone.

431
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:35,577
The queen speaks.

432
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:36,044
Shut up.

433
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,279
Charlie, we don't
have time for this.

434
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,147
I have an idea, though.

435
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,149
Why don't you take your shoes
off and give them to me?

436
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,150
No, you'll stretch mine out.

437
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,885
No, come on, Charlie, you
were fine taking all your

438
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:44,653
clothes off and walking
around in this gross place.

439
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,389
Dee, you'll stretch them out.

440
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,758
All right, Charlie, stop
screwing around, okay?

441
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,626
We're going to miss the movie.

442
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,628
No, we're...

443
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:54,675
You're right.

444
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:55,876
Where are you going?

445
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:56,610
What are you doing?

446
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,344
I'll come back for you.

447
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:58,145
No. No.

448
00:12:58,214 --> 00:12:58,846
I'll come back for you.

449
00:12:58,915 --> 00:12:59,547
Don't... don't you do that.

450
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:01,982
Don't you...
Charlie, get back here right now!

451
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:02,984
Goddamn it!

452
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,452
Oh, goddamn it!

453
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,319
Aw, man!

454
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,153
Come on.

455
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,622
Come on.

456
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,390
(rumbling)

457
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,359
What is that?

458
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:12,760
What is that?

459
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,295
Charlie?

460
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:15,563
Is that the wall of water?

461
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:16,831
No, Charlie.

462
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,933
Charlie, I hear the
wall of water!

463
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:20,935
Come back for me!

464
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,608
(screams)

465
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:39,111
So they'll send a tow
truck and everything?

466
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,912
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:40,613
Don't worry about that.

468
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:41,881
Tow truck is on its way.

469
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:43,316
I see you were born 1985.

470
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,150
<i>Si.</i>

471
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,885
<i>Yeah, so everything
checks out there.</i>

472
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,219
<i>Beautiful.</i>

473
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:49,021
<i>Oh, it's so cool that you own
a chain of auto body repair</i>

474
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,022
<i>shops.</i>

475
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:50,956
<i>I wish I new how to fix cars.</i>

476
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,224
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

477
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,159
<i>Well, auto body repair has
always been a bit of a passion</i>

478
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,227
<i>of mine.</i>

479
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,997
<i>I also invented Facebook
with the Winklevoss twins.</i>

480
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:58,697
<i>Really?</i>

481
00:13:58,766 --> 00:13:59,498
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

482
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:00,532
<i>Zuckerberg didn't do shit.</i>

483
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:01,901
<i>Yeah, he really screwed
us on that one.</i>

484
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,569
<i>I got some hush money,
so it's all good.</i>

485
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:05,905
<i>It's all good.</i>

486
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:09,475
<i>But, uh, I don't want to waste
anymore time here, so...</i>

487
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:10,943
<i>No man left behind!</i>

488
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:11,978
<i>Goddamn it, Mac.</i>

489
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:15,014
<i>What the hell are
you doing here?</i>

490
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,817
<i>I came back for you like I said
I would, like Thundergun does.</i>

491
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,185
<i>Who's the brown girl?</i>

492
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:20,320
<i>Uh, Elena.</i>

493
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:22,055
<i>We got into a little bit
of a fender bender.</i>

494
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:23,490
<i>She was on her way to see</i>
<i>Thundergun,</i> too.

495
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,491
What are the odds of that, huh?

496
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,592
I seen it twice already.

497
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,294
Oh, it's amazing.

498
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:28,429
What's with the helmet, bro?

499
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,597
Pretty cool, huh?

500
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:30,464
Yeah, <i>bonito.</i>

501
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,232
<i>Dude, the helmet
is sweet as shit.</i>

502
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,067
<i>It's very Thundergun.</i>

503
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:33,634
<i>(car horn honking)</i>

504
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,469
<i>I'm going to wear
it during the movie.</i>

505
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:36,003
<i>(car horn honking)</i>

506
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:37,270
<i>Looks like traffic is
clearing up, huh?</i>

507
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:38,038
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

508
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:38,972
<i>All right.</i>

509
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,974
<i>Punch it.</i>

510
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,112
<i>And Charlie and I,
we go down the sewer.</i>

511
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,215
<i>And first thing we do is to
preserve our clothes, we take...</i>

512
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,716
<i>take our clothes off.</i>

513
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:52,552
<i>We get totally naked because
you don't want to get wet.</i>

514
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:53,753
<i>We ball our clothes up.</i>

515
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,455
<i>We stick them up
some place high.</i>

516
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,657
<i>There's this waitress who
Charlie's in love with.</i>

517
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,459
<i>And, uh, I banged her.</i>

518
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:02,595
<i>Charlie got really upset
when I banged the waitress.</i>

519
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:03,796
<i>Uh, but it was a lot of fun.</i>

520
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:05,031
<i>She was a nice piece of ass.</i>

521
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,766
<i>We don't know who
you're talking about.</i>

522
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:07,567
<i>Charlie.</i>

523
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:08,201
<i>He's my buddy.</i>

524
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,002
<i>We sleep together.</i>

525
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,169
<i>We hang out together.</i>

526
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:11,670
<i>Once I pooped in the bed.</i>

527
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,072
<i>I blamed it on him.</i>

528
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,106
<i>(laughs)</i>

529
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,609
<i>One time the guys got
hooked on crack.</i>

530
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,277
<i>It was really crazy.</i>

531
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:20,645
<i>Well, they found a
baby in a Dumpster.</i>

532
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,847
<i>They wanted to make some money
with the baby, but nobody would</i>

533
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,050
<i>buy the baby because
it was white.</i>

534
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,451
<i>So they had to turn it brown.</i>

535
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,852
<i>We were fighting over the sword.</i>

536
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,956
<i>And just about when we were about
to hit each other with the</i>

537
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:34,792
<i>sword, Social Services came in,
thought we were killing the baby.</i>

538
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:37,195
<i>I-I don't
understand this tour.</i>

539
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:38,796
<i>Charlie wrote this musical.</i>

540
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,897
<i>Oh, man, it was really funny.</i>

541
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,666
<i>I played a troll on the musical.</i>

542
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,433
<i>A troll?</i>

543
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:44,167
<i>Yeah.</i>

544
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,369
And it's called <i>The</i>
<i>Nightman Cometh.</i>

545
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,104
<i>I could sing you my
song, if you like.</i>

546
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:48,871
<i>(speaking native language)</i>

547
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,274
<i>You gotta... you gotta pay the
troll toll to get into this</i>

548
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:54,343
<i>boy's hole.</i>

549
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:58,814
<i>Yeah, and, uh...
But you gotta pay to get in.</i>

550
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,750
<i>I was saying, "soul."</i>

551
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:04,220
<i>He thought I was
saying, "boy's hole."</i>

552
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:07,757
<i>One of the things I like doing
most is banging whores.</i>

553
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:11,027
<i>I, uh, I go out and
bang a lot of whores.</i>

554
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:18,169
<i>Listen, here's the thing.</i>

555
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,505
<i>I'm going to have to
jump off here.</i>

556
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:23,709
<i>So you guys enjoy the rest of
the tour on your own, okay?</i>

557
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:25,911
<i>How are we supposed to
get back to our tour bus?</i>

558
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,179
<i>That's your problem.</i>

559
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,947
<i>Welcome to Philly.</i>

560
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:31,049
<i>(all yelling)</i>

561
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:34,252
<i>No hesitation.</i>

562
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,853
<i>Nah, no surrender.</i>

563
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,422
<i>No hesitation.</i>

564
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:38,656
<i>No surrender.</i>

565
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:39,824
<i>No surrender.</i>

566
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,092
<i>No surrender.</i>

567
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,727
<i>No surren... (siren whoops)</i>

568
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,996
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

569
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:48,732
<i>I surrender.</i>

570
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:53,037
<i>Coming soon to a
theater near you.</i>

571
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:56,173
<i>All right, okay, there's
a nice way to do that.</i>

572
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:57,342
<i>There's a nice way to do that.</i>

573
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,545
<i>From the director...
Ooh! Aah!</i>

574
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,214
<i>That's tart.</i>

575
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,916
<i>This seat taken right here?</i>

576
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,083
<i>Charlie, you made it.</i>

577
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,753
<i>What's up, Mac?!</i>

578
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,588
<i>I got a seat right
in the middle, bro.</i>

579
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,089
<i>Aw, dude, that's an
awesome helmet, man.</i>

580
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,057
<i>Thanks, dude.</i>

581
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:12,857
<i>Yo, where's Dee?</i>

582
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:14,493
<i>Uh, she couldn't
make it, bro.</i>

583
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:15,727
<i>Wasn't Thundergun enough.</i>

584
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:16,527
<i>How about Dennis?</i>

585
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:17,428
<i>Oh, yeah, he's here.</i>

586
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,563
<i>He's Thundergunning some
Mexican chick in the back.</i>

587
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:20,364
<i>Nice.</i>

588
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,199
<i>He's moving a lot faster
than usual, huh?</i>

589
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,567
<i>I think he's
getting a hand job.</i>

590
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:24,301
<i>Oh, I am.</i>

591
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,368
<i>Hand job.</i>

592
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:27,837
<i>Hey, can you guys,
uh, maybe be quiet?</i>

593
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,472
<i>Well, why don't you switch
seats with us if it's bothering</i>

594
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,106
<i>you so much.</i>

595
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,374
<i>Just switch seats, you
know what I mean?</i>

596
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,509
<i>Just switch seats.</i>

597
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,910
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

598
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:34,544
<i>All right.</i>

599
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,113
<i>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

600
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,917
<i>Squeeze in, squeeze in.</i>

601
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:41,752
<i>Hey, Dee, you made it.</i>

602
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,120
<i>Yeah, you bet
your ass I made it.</i>

603
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:43,854
<i>Charlie, my clothes are dry.</i>

604
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:44,588
<i>You held them over your head?</i>

605
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:45,155
<i>Took them all off.</i>

606
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:45,756
<i>Held them over my head.</i>

607
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:46,857
<i>I told you that
water was coming.</i>

608
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:47,458
<i>No problem. Yeah.</i>

609
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:48,092
<i>Excuse me, Miss?</i>

610
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:48,726
<i>Yeah.</i>

611
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:49,994
<i>But your stench
is unbearable.</i>

612
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:50,561
<i>It's bad, isn't it?</i>

613
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,929
<i>Yes.</i>

614
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:52,263
<i>That's shit in my
hair, that's why.</i>

615
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:53,931
<i>What if you switch seats, and
then I can be closer to those</i>

616
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,332
<i>guys and you can...
Babe, let's get outta here.</i>

617
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,569
<i>We won't smell as much, and
then you won't hear all the</i>

618
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:01,905
<i>talking and...
Congratulations.</i>

619
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:02,605
<i>This is a much better seat.</i>

620
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:04,073
<i>So the water wall came, huh?</i>

621
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:05,107
<i>Yeah, came with a vengeance.</i>

622
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,009
<i>Dennis is getting a
hand job in the back.</i>

623
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:07,509
<i>Seriously?</i>

624
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,310
<i>Yeah.</i>

625
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,111
<i>Oh, congratulations.</i>

626
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,212
<i>Well, we're all here.</i>

627
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:11,346
<i>Except Frank.</i>

628
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,682
<i>I wonder where Frank is?</i>

629
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,617
<i>Okay, you got one phone
call, make it quick.</i>

630
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:17,819
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

631
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:29,030
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

632
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:32,734
<i>I'd like to report
a bomb threat.</i>

633
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:35,170
<i>He's not qualified...
Would you shut up?</i>

634
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,338
<i>The movie's about to start.</i>

635
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:36,838
<i>Can you shut up?</i>

636
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,006
<i>Well, switch with us if
you're getting so upset.</i>

637
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:39,607
<i>Fine.</i>

638
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:41,208
<i>Yeah, why don't you
go up there and then...</i>

639
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,043
<i>We're having a conversation.</i>

640
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,077
<i>Bad attitude.</i>

641
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:43,711
<i>Talk about shutting up.</i>

642
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,279
<i>Dennis, you're going
to like the seat.</i>

643
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,747
<i>At a certain point, it's your
fault, you know what I mean, for</i>

644
