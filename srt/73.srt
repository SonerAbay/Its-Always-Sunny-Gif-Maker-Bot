1
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:03,533
No, we never had
kings in this country.

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:05,166
No, I don't
think we ever had kings.

3
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:07,866
That was the whole point of this
country is that we didn't want a king.

4
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:08,698
We didn't want the king.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,532
Son of a bitch!

6
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:10,467
Guys, guys, guys.

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,472
Oh.

8
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:12,476
Are you okay?

9
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,478
Oh!

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,482
Oh!

11
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:18,298
I think you broke your nose.

12
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,792
I'm screwed. I'm screwed. Ah!

13
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:24,163
Oh, strange man, titty bar.

14
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:25,567
A great investment opportunity.

15
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:26,570
Beauty pageant.

16
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:27,571
Are you getting it?

17
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,573
Yeah, yeah, I think I got this.

18
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:31,877
You met a strange man at a titty
bar who offered you a great

19
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,180
opportunity to invest
in a beauty pageant?

20
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:36,250
Everything looked very legit.

21
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:37,651
It was all in place.

22
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,053
He had all the connections.

23
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,454
He wanted somebody
to front the money.

24
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:42,689
Me. Okay, fine.

25
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,824
I've always wanted to
do a beauty pageant.

26
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:45,825
Stop. Why?

27
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,794
Because you make a lot of cash,
and you ogle some broads.

28
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:50,795
Yeah, I don't question
that aspect of it.

29
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:52,798
Yeah, that seems right
up your alley, bro.

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,437
Oh, this jerk gets pinched
for coming on to one of the

31
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,042
contestants, and now it
looks like a whole scam.

32
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:01,645
And if I don't legitimize this
thing, everybody's gonna think

33
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:02,580
I'm just like him.

34
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,583
Why don't you just
drop the whole thing?

35
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:05,584
I can't, Charlie.

36
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:06,585
It's already going.

37
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:07,587
It's in motion.

38
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:08,688
I mean, it's really a mess.

39
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,726
Any second now, there's gonna be broads
walking through that door in swimsuits.

40
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:13,760
Awesome.

41
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:14,761
That's a good thing.

42
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:17,031
Yeah, I don't see what the
problem is here, Frank.

43
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:21,202
Oh! Looks like somebody
forgot their swimsuit.

44
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:25,205
Come on, girls.

45
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:32,111
That's the problem.

46

47
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:57,996
A kids' pageant.

48
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,998
I didn't know...
Are you kidding me?

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,867
I didn't know it was
a kids' pageant.

50
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:02,701
The guy didn't make that clear.

51
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,703
Now I'm lumped in
with a diddler.

52
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:05,704
What am I gonna do?

53
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:06,705
This is a mess.

54
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,541
Well, I don't know
what the big deal is.

55
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,409
You know, I did pageants all
the time when I was little.

56
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,410
The big deal?

57
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:13,145
The big deal is that mothers
force their kids into this so

58
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:16,082
that they can dress them up like dolls
and parade them around like sex objects.

59
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:17,082
It's creepy.

60
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,084
My mother didn't
force me into it.

61
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:20,085
I entered them myself.

62
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,086
Yeah, that's true.

63
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,855
Actually, when Dee used to enter
pageants when we were kids, Mom

64
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:25,458
used to tell her not to waste her time,
because she isn't pretty enough.

65
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,360
Mm-hmm, she would say that, and
then I would jam it right in

66
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,294
her face when I'd win them.

67
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,162
How would you win pageants?

68
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:30,163
Did you have a different face?

69
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,165
No, she was a dog
back then, too.

70
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,367
It's just that
she worked at it.

71
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,871
She used to go to tanning, and you
know, she practiced with her makeup.

72
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,873
I'll give you that-- you did
a lot of that practicing.

73
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,874
Thanks, Frank.

74
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,744
Yeah, yeah, you guys got to change
your thinking about child pageants.

75
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,546
I mean, child pageants-- that's
American tradition right there.

76
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,547
Child pageantry.

77
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:46,548
Think about it.

78
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,085
In other countries, okay, women that
can't show their ankles, right?

79
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,020
They got to be in those big,
black tarps or whatever.

80
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,021
Mm.

81
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:54,756
In America, we can show toddlers
in tiny bikinis, we can

82
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,692
make them tan, because
that's our right.

83
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:57,693
Mm-hmm.

84
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,694
As Americans, okay.

85
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,696
Child pageantry is an essential
part of the American fabric.

86
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:01,697
You know what?

87
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,700
We should dress up our little kids
just to show other people that we can.

88
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:05,701
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,536
Yeah, yeah, I never thought
about it that way.

90
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:08,370
This is about
freedom, isn't it?

91
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,371
Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,206
We can do whatever we
want with our kids.

93
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,207
Yeah.

94
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,008
And that's what
America is all about.

95
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,877
You know what you
just did, Charlie?

96
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,645
You just loaded up that train
with coal, and now it's ready to

97
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,379
tear down the tracks.

98
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:19,213
That was inspiring as hell.

99
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,214
Yes.

100
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,015
Let's throw ourselves a pageant!

101
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:23,016
Let's do a child pageant.

102
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:24,017
U.S.A.

103
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,021
U.S.A., U.S.A.,
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!

104
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,392
Okay. Okay.

105
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,693
Thank you. Thank you. Good.

106
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,994
Thank... Calm down, everybody.

107
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,129
Calm down. Calm down.

108
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,264
Thanks for coming to
Frank's Little Beauties.

109
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,367
I want to thank you all
for participating.

110
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,702
I know some of you may have
heard about that other guy.

111
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,905
I am not gonna
diddle your kids.

112
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,106
I'm not like that.

113
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,108
That's not my thing.

114
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,109
I met that guy in a titty bar.

115
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,144
It's like a... That's enough.
That's enough.

116
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,014
Hi there. Dee Reynolds,
former pageant winner.

117
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:55,285
I know how these things work, so,
uh, your kids are in good hands.

118
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,254
Go ahead and talk
amongst yourselves.

119
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:58,255
Frank, will you...?

120
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:00,291
Frank, your nose is bleeding
all over the place.

121
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:03,093
Do I look suspicious?

122
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,662

We shouldn't be looking at
this pageant as a problem.

130
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,675
We should be looking at this as
an opportunity to do something

131
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:19,610
we've never done before.

132
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,612
This is right in our wheelhouse.

133
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:24,582
I'm having a blast putting this...
Hey, I'm thinking maybe we could

134
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,583
actually be in this thing?

135
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,887
I'm glad you said it, because I'm
desperate to be in this thing.

136
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,888
Oh!

137
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,889
I didn't realize it was
even a conversation.

138
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:33,724
I always assumed we would
be heavily involved.

139
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:34,759
This is bad.

140
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:37,862
We got to definitely write a song
about how we do not diddle kids.

people to think that you are

00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,637
diddling kids than by
writing a song about it.

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,638
You got to write a song.

145

No.

151
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,485
I'm cloudy. I got a headache.

Uh, excuse me.

153

yells the loudest, but I am the

155
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:16,111
only one here right now,
so I am in charge.

156
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,112
Oh, hi.

157
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,113
Uh, my name is Walter Harris.

158
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:19,114
Hi.

159
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:22,116
I'm with the Family Association

00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,051
Okay.

162
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:31,758
Uh, you know, I... I'm-I'm pretty much...
I'm in charge of this... the

163
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,928
chairs and... setting up...
the chairs.

164
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,929
Mm.

165
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:36,997
But there's a guy.

166
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,665
Uh, uh, there's a fat guy.

167
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:42,903
Well, his face is busted to bits, and he...
he's in charge.

168
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,904
He's-He's the guy that
you want to talk to.

169
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:48,942
He might be this way, so I'll go...
I'm gonna go back here and look for him.

170
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:51,010
Uh, you check it out
around the corner.

171
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:53,712
Real jacked up face and fat.

172
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:57,383
So, how's everyone doing today?

173
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:58,584
Is everyone feeling safe?

174
00:05:58,586 --> 00:05:59,585
The F.A.P.C., huh?

175
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,586
That's what he said.

176
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:02,588
They're siccing the
dogs after us.

177
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,589
We're screwed.

178
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:04,423
Hey, we're fine, Frank.

179
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,423
We got nothing to hide.

180
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,358
Yeah, you know what?

181
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,359
To be honest with you, I'm
glad he's gonna observe us.

182
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,361
I mean, somebody should be
looking out for these kids.

183
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,429
Yeah, those mothers just left
their kids here in a bar with

184
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:15,098
complete strangers in a pageant
that's under investigation.

185
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:17,934
They're terrible parents.

186
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:18,935
Yeah.

187
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:19,936
This is a mess!

188
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:21,670
Frank, why don't you go lay
down and put some ice on your

189
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,438
face, 'cause you look terrible?

190
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,272
Yeah, Jesus, Frank, fix
your face, for God sake.

191
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,273
Yeah.

192
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,274
Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,275
Relax. Go, go.

194
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,110
We'll take care of
everything in here.

195
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:30,978
Everything's gonna
be fine, Frank.

196
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,979
Yeah, we got it. We got it.

197
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:32,813
It's all gonna be fine.

198
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,814
Now you pinned the whole
thing on him, right?

199
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:35,648
Oh, yeah, of course I did.

200
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,649
Hey, good thinking.

201
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:37,649
Good. Good, good, good, good.

202
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:41,686
Okay, ladies, chins up,
hands down, step forward.

One, two, three, one, two.

00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,564
Come on, hit the line.

Get in line. What is this?

209

Guys, we got to put on a show!

210
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,503
I thought you were
professionals.

211
00:06:57,505 --> 00:07:00,639
That's what I'm looking for,
and I don't see professionals.

212
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:08,513
I see amateurs, I see trash, little
pieces of trash on my stage.

213
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,514
You guys are dummies.

214
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,149
It's not even hard.

215
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,617
You are dumb.

216
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,019
It's not hard.

217
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,019
Samantha's mean.

218
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:20,323
Samantha gets to be mean
because Samantha is a star, okay?

219
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,524
Maybe one day you'll be a star,
but right now you're not.

220
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,192
You're junk.

221
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,259
I have to go to the bathroom.

222
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:25,026
You belong in the bathroom.

223
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,027
Go!

224
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,096
Let's take a five,
let's take a break.

225
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:28,765
I'm so upset.

226
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,432
Are you okay?

227
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:32,268
You're doing great.

228
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,437
We'll be dressed very stylishly
for the performance.

229
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,507
It's going to be a great
performance, Walter, very classy.

230
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,508
I look forward to seeing it.

231
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,110
Just make sure that the
children are featured.

232
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,178
That is who this is about.

233
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,178
Yeah.

234
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,979
Yeah... it's about the kids.

235
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:45,314
Absolutely, all about
the kids, yeah.

to come sit with us?

show, you guys, we got to.

00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:59,895
Hello.

244
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,464
That was some pretty impressive
work out there, Samantha.

245
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,599
Excuse me, I'm eating my lunch.

246
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,368
Well, don't get sassy with me.

247
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,803
I'm trying to pay
you a compliment.

248
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,939
You know, I see a lot
of myself in you.

249
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,940
You're not like me.

250
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:13,941
You're ugly.

You don't-- that's not
something you say.

252
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,178
You're mean.

I don't like your hair.

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:32,788
It's dumb.

260

Your hair looks like it's dead.

All right, that's it.

All hair is technically dead,

stupid, stupid idiot.

265

yourself, Samantha.

267
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:44,197

Dude, you're wheezing now.

273

Slow down.

274
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:56,143
Breathe and eat separately.

275
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:57,912

okay, being able to eat

276

Can we just change the conversation?

Can we just focus
on something else?

00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,401
My mom says I'm not
pretty enough.

322
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:29,536
Your mom doesn't know dick.

323
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:32,105
She's a dumb, fat cow, and your
sister-- she is a stupid little

324
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:32,839
shit-mouthed bitch, isn't she?

325
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,908
You just said a
lot of bad words.

326
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,311
Here's what's gonna happen, Justine,
you are going to win this pageant.

327
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,279
You are gonna win this pageant!

328
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,781
And I am going to be the one
who pushes you to do it.

329
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:42,882
What do you think about that?

330
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:43,749
Are you excited?

331
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,917
Are you excited about that?

332
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,719
Yeah, I don't really
care about any of that.

333
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:49,721
I know, but it's not what you care
about, it's what I care about.

334
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:50,723
Okay.

335
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,724
Okay, ready?

336
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,225
Oh, we got a lot of work to do.

337
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:53,893
Screw this homework, right?

338
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:55,894
Come on.

339
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:05,263
So great to see you.

340
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:06,139
It's a pleasure to meet you.

341
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,069
Thank you so much.

342
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,002
Thank you very...
Guys, Walter's here.

343
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,241
He looks very pleased.

344
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:11,008
Good, good, he should.

345
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,844
I mean, this is like...
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:13,845
Okay, good.

347
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:14,512
I'm here.

348
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,513
Oh.

349
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,248
What on earth did you
do to your face?

350
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,317
I had it done at a funeral home.

351
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,318
Why, why, why?

352
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,022
Where in the hell am I going to go-- to
the goddamn makeup counter at Macy's?

353
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,924
You go to a funeral home
to get gruesome repairs.

354
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:27,925
Look.

355
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,026
You look like you're
at your own wake.

356
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:35,166
Frank, Frank, I need some water.

357
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:39,003
My mouth is dry.

358
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,004
Your mouth is dry.

359
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:45,543
Go into the toilet and run
your mouth under the sink.

360
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,545
Okay.

361
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,979
Yeah, can I, could I, can I?

362
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,514
I have a... Who's that?

363
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:51,182
He's the mortician.

364
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:51,849
I invited him.

365
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,517
Oh, you brought the mortician.

366
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,386
Okay, well, that's not going to
seem strange to anybody at all.

367
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,153
I figure he's a cretin.

368
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,956
Why would I have a cretin like that
near me if I have something to hide?

369
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,725
Hmm... Associating with a man like
that's not going to make you

370
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,326
look any better.

371
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,262
Hey, hey, hey,
you're on in five.

372
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:04,929
Oh, whoa.

373
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,697
Artemis, what are
you doing here?

374
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,199
She's working the
soundboard, okay, relax.

375
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:08,966
Is that a good idea?

376
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,035
Does she know how to
work a soundboard?

377
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,103
Who else are we going to get?

378
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,173
We don't have a very
deep bench, dude.

379
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,173
Okay.

380
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,775
I'm gonna go get high
before the show.

381
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,776
Okay.

382
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,544
Seems like a bad idea.

383
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,244
Well, don't get high.

384
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,479
It's making us look bad.

385
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:21,613
I'm sweating like a pig.

386
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,681
I got to get my makeup redone.

387
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:23,348
Okay, showtime, showtime.

Well, someone should have

00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,354
Probably the kid.

484
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,355
The kid definitely.

485
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,356
Yeah.

486
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,357
It felt uncomfortable.

487
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,359
But at a rave, I feel like
that would have been awesome.

488

I know, but the
kids make it weird.

If I was dead, you could bang
me all you want. Who cares?

497

Dead body's like a

Make a stew out of my ass.

505
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:35,363
What's the big deal?
Bang me, eat me, grind me up into little

That was a mistake.

she was a bitch, but she was

Play something nice.
