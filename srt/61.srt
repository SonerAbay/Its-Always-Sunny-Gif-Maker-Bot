We have got to open

The first listener who can
correctly answer our stupid

trivia question of the day is
gonna get to come down to the

00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:17,896
Flyers game with us tomorrow night
and take a shot from center ice.

Dude, nothing
but busy signals.

10
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:30,889
I'm on hold on all of them.

11
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:31,391
You're on hold on those?

12
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,392
We're gonna get through.

13
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,393
Hey, who's on the line?

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,394
Is that us?

15
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:35,395
That sounded like us.

16
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:36,396
Uh, Mac from South Philly.

17
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:39,399
All right, Mac from South Philly,
you're on with Preston and Steve.

18
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:40,433
Holy shit! He got on.

19
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,434
Holy shit, I got on.

20
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:42,435
Please don't curse.

21
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:43,469
All right, here's the question.

22
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:46,506
What Philadelphia Flyer holds the
franchise record for goals in a season?

23
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:47,507
You have 30 seconds. Go!

24
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:48,508
This is hockey question.

25
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:49,509
Go! Go! Hockey, hockey.

26
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:50,510
Uh, where's the H key?

27
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:51,511
There's no H key?

28
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:53,513
There's no H key...
What are you talking about?

29
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,515
Is there another way to spell hockey?

30
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:56,516
There's no H key.

31
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,517
Dude!

32
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,152
There's no H key on this...
There's an H right there.

33
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,054
What would be the next letter?

34
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:02,889
Why did I put you in
charge of this job?

35
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:03,723
Oh, forget this, dude.

36
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:04,557
I got this. I got this.

37
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,391
Think, Mac. Think. Think. Think.

38
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,259
I got to think like that guy.

39
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:07,126
That guy that sits on the rock.

40
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:07,994
This dude? The one like that?

41
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,695
Yeah, with the big muscles,
and he puts his on his...

42
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:11,431
Ah, he's big and green and...
Think, think.

43
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:12,432
The Thinker?

44
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:13,433
The Thinker.

45
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,434
Oh, the Hulk.

46
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,435
The Incredible Hulk.

47
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:17,236
Hulk doesn't think...
The Hulk?

48
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,237
Shit, dude, I know this.

49
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,239
Dude, you got to stop cursing!

50
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:22,241
Look, you guys can't censor me, okay?
I'm a bit of a badass.

51
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:23,109
You can't censor him.

52
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:23,943
All right, let's go.

53
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:24,744
Answer the question, come on.

54
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:25,578
Just take a wild guess.

55
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:26,412
Aah! I don't know.

56
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,246
I don't know it. Damn it!

57
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:28,247
Reggie Leach.

58
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,249
Reggie Leach is the...
correct answer!

Not potentially.
It is a life-changing opportunity. It is!

66
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,941
I'm sorry. How is spending a
weekend at a radio show beach

67
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,943
house a life-changing

Hey, can we have our phones back?
em about using the minutes on the

cell phones?

74
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,794
They used up all your minutes, right?

75
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,462
Frank, nobody gives a shit
about minutes anymore.

76
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,297
Actually, you know what?

77
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:49,164
I do give a shit about minutes.

78
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:50,799
I know I shouldn't, and I think
I'm just probably buying into

79
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,634
the phone company's
propaganda, but there you go.

80
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:53,635
Interesting.

81
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:54,503
What is happening here?

82
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,337
Why are you taping them?

83
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,172
Oh, because they got great banter.

84
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,173
They jib jab.

85
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,007
Jib jab, jib jab, jib jab.

86
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,009
I use it for the car...
I jib jab.

87

...'cause my stereo's busted.

88
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:03,679
We have a lot of interesting
things to say, so, you know.

89
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,314
Oh, shit. Well, I feel like
the conversation we've been

90
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,948
having in the last five minutes
is a lot more interesting than

91
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,750
the shit they're talking
about on the radio.

92
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:09,751
Mm-hmm.

93
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,585
Are you kidding me?

94
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:13,255
It's just moronic commentary and stupid
sound effects, and it's just dumb.

95
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:14,089
It doesn't make any sense.

96
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:14,923
Well, we have voices.

97
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:15,757
We talk about the issues.

98
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,592
You know, I feel like we could
do a podcast, and it would be

99
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,262
a million times better than whatever
that drivel was we were listening to.

100
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,263
Without a doubt.

101
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:22,097
You know what?

102
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:22,931
This sounds like jealousy talk.

103
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:23,932
Yeah.

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,435
Mac, Charlie, congratulations on, uh,
your slap shot and the beach house, okay?

105
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:27,269
Uh, we're happy for you.

106
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:28,103
You're sad sometimes.

107
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:29,938
Yeah, why aren't you happy for us?

108
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,606
You're dark souls...
I mean, you know what?

109
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:33,475
You want to just do
our thing and not...?

110
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:34,476
Let's do our thing.

111
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:36,278
Have fun with your important
conversations and your big

112
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,113
issues with your brains and
your smart stuff, okay?

113
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,114
We got hockey to learn.

114
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,116
And we're gonna...
It's gonna change our lives.

115
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,117
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,118
Life changing.

117
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:44,119
Okay, it was The Thinker.

118
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,120
It's The Thinker.

119
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,122
Yeah.
You couldn't spell hockey.

120
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,123
Right.

Oh, zing! ♪ Bo, bo! ♪

122

You guys are the best.

124
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:52,961
Do not speak until I
turn my tape over.

125
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:53,962
Okay.

126
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,897
Aw, shit!

127
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,133
I taped over my
Luther Vandross mix.

128
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:01,670
Aah!

129
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,274
Okay, dude, now we're
both in agreement.

130
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,943
This is probably, like, the
biggest opportunity either of us

131
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,778
have ever had in
our lives, right?

132
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:11,780
We are not men who get a lot
of opportunities, Charlie.

133
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:12,781
No.

134
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:14,616
The few we've had,
we've squandered.

135
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:15,450
We've squandered them all.

136
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,285
That's why we've got
to stay focused, Mac.

137
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:18,120
I mean, this is big time.

138
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:18,954
This is pro sports, right?

139
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:19,788
Yeah, mm-hmm.

140
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:20,622
We got to do this right.

141
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,623
You got to look good.

142
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,624
Yeah.

143
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,459
And you can't miss
that shot, right?

144
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:26,294
I really appreciate you
helping me, dude.

145
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,964
Absolutely. Well, a little Peewee
Hockey experience never hurts.

146
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:29,965
You're good.

147
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:30,799
Okay, so first things first.

148
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:31,633
Hold the hockey stick.

149
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:32,467
Hold the hockey stick?

150
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:33,468
Mm-hmm.

151
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,303
Okay, good, 'cause I was
thinking, I'd have a position

152
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:36,304
sort of like this.

153
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:38,306
Why would you do that?

154
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:40,308
All of my instincts and my
training tell me to use this as

155
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,309
a weapon.

156
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:43,378
All of your instincts and
your training are wrong.

157
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:45,414
Hold it like a hockey stick, or
people are going to boo you.

158
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:47,416
The Philly fans are
brutal, dude.

159
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,417
All right, fine!

160
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,418
All right? Right.

161
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:52,421
Then you just sort of haunch
down a little bit... Done.

162
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:59,428
You might want to haun...
What if I do this?a...

163
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,429
That's way stiffer.

164
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,431
That's pretty good
right there, Charlie.

165
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:03,432
You look so awkward.

166
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,434
Bro, when you tack on mass,
you sacrifice flexibility.

167
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,435
That's just a straight-up fact.

168
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:07,436
That's insane.

169
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:08,437
Touch your toes.

170
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:09,438
What am I, a gymnast?

171
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:12,441
Yeah... Charlie, teach me
how to shoot the shot.

172
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:13,442
All right, fine, fine.

173
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:14,443
Calm down. All right, all right.

174
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,444
Yeah.

175
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,646
What you're gonna want to do is just gently...
gently sort of

176
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:20,482
guide the puck at the net, like...
you know, like a tiny

177
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,717
bowl of cream you don't want to
spill, and you're guiding it.

178
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:23,718
I'm not gonna do that.

179
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:26,721
I'm going to go out there and take
a wicked slap shot, you know?

180
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,723
Really make a name for myself.

181
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,725
Otherwise, I go out there,
I look like a jabroni.

182
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:31,726
You know what?

183
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,728
Yeah, we might want to work on
some kind of routine, huh?

184
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:34,729
Thank you. Exactly.

185
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,730
So I'll go out there.

186
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:36,731
I showcase my weaponry.

187
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,500
Uh-huh.

188
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:39,501
Pump the crowd up.

189
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:40,502
Really get the crowd up.

190
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,503
And raise the roof on 'em.

191
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:42,771
Watch. Uh-huh.

192
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,772
Okay. But you know what?

193
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,774
You can't take a slap shot
before you even know how to

194
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:48,643
handle a stick and a puck,
so will you just glide one?

195
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:49,811
Just to get the form.

196
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,813
And then we'll get bigger and
bigger, and eventually, slap

197
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,882
shots, but it starts with
gliding like cream.

198
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,883
Go.

199
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:57,285
Gliding like a jabroni is
what I'm gonna be doing.

200
00:05:57,353 --> 00:06:00,288
Jabroni. Okay, go.

201
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:04,292
Well, that didn't do anything.

202
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,294
Well, that was pretty
pathetic, you're right.

203
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,296
Yeah, well, the problem is, I'm
out in the elements, dude.

204
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,297
There's so much wind and sun.

205
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,298
All right.

206
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,133
And this asphalt--
that's not regulation.

207
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:12,968
No it's not regulation.

208
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,803
So it's not...
All right, you know what?

209
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,671
You want to do this
the right way?

210
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:17,672
Yeah.

211
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,507
Let's go to the ice.

212
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:19,341
Let's get some pucks, all right?

213
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,209
We'll slide, we'll take
a few slap shots.

214
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:22,210
Let's go to the ice.

215
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:23,211
We'll do this the right way.

216
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,212
Let's go to the ice.

217
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,213
Let's go to the ice.

218
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,448
This is me.

219
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,450
All right, very exciting stuff.

220
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,118
I think we're pretty much ready
to go here with this podcast.

221
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:30,952
What the hell is a podcast?

222
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,954
I mean, why don't
you just tape it?

223
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:33,955
What are you doing?

224
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:35,790
You don't have to tape
it these days, Frank.

225
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,626
You just record it right
onto the computer.

226
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:38,627
Hmm.

227
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,295
And, uh, once we start recording,
Frank, we need you to

228
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,129
stop eating those crackers.

229
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,964
It's incredibly annoying, and
it's all anyone's gonna be able

230
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:43,965
to hear.

231
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,967
So, Dennis and Dee
Reynolds here.

232
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:46,968
Inaugural podcast.

233
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:47,969
We're talking technology today.

234
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:48,970
The big T.

235
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:49,971
Absolutely.

236
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,973
Everyone's talking about
technology these days, because

237
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,974
it's everywhere.

238
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:53,975
Oh, it is.

239
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:54,976
You can't escape it.

240
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:55,977
You absolutely can't.

241
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:58,413
So, Dee, tell us what you
feel about technology.

242
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:59,414
How do you...?

243
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,183
What's your opinion on it?

244
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:15,964
crackers?

245
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:17,232
I'm getting bored with this.

246
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,667
I'm going to bring my guest in.

247
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:19,501
Guest?

248
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,602
I asked Cricket to come.

249
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,169
What?

250
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:21,870
Cricket?

251
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:22,571
No, Frank.

252
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:23,939
You can't just bring
guests in here.

253
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:24,940
This is our podcast.

254
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,207
I feel like you're
trying to take over.

255
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:26,708
No, no, no.

256
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:27,208
You know what?

257
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:28,577
Actually, this could bring
up a pretty good issue.

258
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:30,512
If you bring Cricket in here,
we could rail on him about the

259
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,212
homeless issue.

260
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,013
Cricket!

261
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:32,614
Cricks.

262
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:33,648
Yo.

263
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:34,149
There he is.

264
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:34,716
Come on in, buddy.

265
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:35,350
We're ready for you.

266
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,152
Hey, Frank, where's my chicken?

267
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,053
This is taking forever.

268
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,720
Come on.

269
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:40,121
I promised him a
rotisserie chicken.

270
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:40,855
Let's go.

271
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:41,389
Chop, chop.

272
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:42,023
I'm starving here.

273
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:43,458
What's going on
with your voice?

274
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:45,160
It's from when Frank hit
me with the trash can.

275
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:46,328
Wound got infected.

276
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,729
It was a whole ordeal.

277
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:48,396
Okay, all right.

278
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,732
Well, um... Listen, let's
get into the issues here.

279
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,267
We're going to start
rolling on this, Cricket.

280
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:53,234
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,738
I am not saying another word
until I get the chicken.

282
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:58,506
I lied about the
chicken, Crick.

283
00:07:58,574 --> 00:07:59,140
Are you kidding me?

284
00:07:59,208 --> 00:07:59,641
All right?

285
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,275
It was bullshit.

286
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:01,109
Oh, my God.

287
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:02,110
Unbelievable.

288
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:02,844
Why do I even trust you?

289
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:03,878
All right, wait a minute.

290
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:04,546
Here.

291
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,247
I do have something for you.

292
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:07,382
Lemons.

293
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:07,983
Lemons?

294
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,783
Yeah, you suck on them.

295
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,618
Oh, come on.

296
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:11,086
At least give me the crackers.

297
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,354
No, suck on a lemon.

298
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:13,054
Here, go ahead.

299
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:14,222
Well, they are good for scurvy.

300
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,358
All right, I'll have a few lemons,
but then I'm out of here.

301
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,092
All right, here we go.

302
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,095
So, uh, Dennis and
Dee Reynolds here.

303
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,764
We are talking about the
homeless issue here in Philly.

304
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,599
That's a big issue these days,
and we're here with our friend

305
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,166
Cricket.

306
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,234
He is a homeless man.

307
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:28,803
Cricket, walk us through
a day in your life.

308
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:33,408
Oh, day in the life...
Well, uh, the other morning, I

309
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:37,312
wake up, I find a dog
sniffing at my wound.

310
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,080
He's fully aroused, mind you.

311
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:40,582
So I'm thinking, "Oh, great,"

312
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,450
you know, "what does
this jerk want?"

313
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:44,019
Of course I know what he wants.

314
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,654
He's looking at me
right in the eyes.

315
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:47,656
He does not have to say it.

316
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:48,690
Not that he could.

317
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,928
Oh, that is-that is tart.

318
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,430
That is really tart.

319
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:59,567
I mean, does my scar look
like a dog's vagina?

320
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:00,235
You know, maybe.

321
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:00,935
I don't know.

322
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:03,204
I'm not going to sit here and try
to get inside the mind of a

323
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:04,205
dog.

324
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:05,006
I mean, that's God's work.

325
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,342
Well, not that I believe in God.

326
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,076
I don't.

327
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,644
Not since that Chinaman
stole my kidney.

328
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:11,446
Cricket, tell Dee how much
you think she's ugly.

329
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,248
That's not going to
make any sense, Frank.

330
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:14,049
He doesn't think I'm ugly.

331
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:15,050
He's madly in love with me.

332
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:15,884
Don't flatter yourself.

333
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:16,685
I'm over you, sister.

334
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:17,619
Since when?

335
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,721
Since I found out
you are a whore.

336
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,589
Will you stop talking about...
This has nothing...

337
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:24,325
Well, maybe you're a whore, you
stupid, ugly, homeless bitch.

338
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:25,326
Zing.

339
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:26,594
A dog banged your
neck the other day.

340
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:27,262
You're both whores.

341
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:36,004
Well, a No, no, this
is not good radio!

342
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:37,005
All right.

343
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:40,141
Okay, this is exciting, Mack.

344
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,042
This is exciting.

345
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,343
You know, you're...
What are you doing?

346
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:43,344
Huh?

347
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:44,713
Would you take this seriously?

348
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,413
I am taking it seriously.

349
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,414
This is your big moment, man.

350
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:49,217
You got to walk out to center
ice, and you got to be like,

351
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:51,319
"Hey, USA!

352
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:52,353
USA!"

353
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:53,254
USA!

354
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:54,255
Not like that.

355
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:55,557
Make it classy.

356
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,592
Okay, but keep in mind I am going
to be wearing the duster.

357
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,260
Well, of course you're
going to wear the duster.

358
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:00,028
That's going to look awesome.

359
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:01,029
Thanks.

360
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,764
Yeah. You should probably
also be wearing a wig.

361
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:03,865
A wig?

362
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:04,466
Totally.

363
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,267
Long, flowing hair.

364
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,636
That's going to look way more
dramatic, you know what I mean?

365
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:12,073
Like... Okay, I like the
wig idea in spirit.

366
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,342
Problem is, I'll have to wear
the wig to the beach house so

367
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,610
people will recognize me.

368
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:17,579
Next thing you know, I'm wearing
a wig for the rest of my life

369
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:18,847
just to keep up appearances.

370
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:20,148
Yeah, like Andre Agassi, huh?

371
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:21,516
Yeah, right.

372
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:22,317
I don't want to do that.

373
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,184
I don't know.

374
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,419
Let's not rule it out, though.

375
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,755
A good hockey wig could put
this thing over the top, man.

376
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:27,889
Okay, fine.

377
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:28,690
All right, all right.

378
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:29,991
Let's do this, let's
do this thing!

379
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:30,692
All right, make some shots.

380
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,026
What else are we
here for, dude?

381
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:32,894
Let's do some shots!

382
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:33,661
All right.

383
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:34,229
All right, you ready?

384
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,029
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

385
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:35,830
Let's see what you got.

386
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,199
Haunch.

387
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:39,968
What was that?

388
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,302
All right, well...

389
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,037
That would have been cool if
I was standing backwards.

390
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,939
Well, you're not going to stand
backwards, you're going to

391
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:45,740
stand forwards.

392
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:48,409
You're going... What the hell
are you two doing out here?

393
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,245
Don't worry about it, bro.

394
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,647
We're practicing... You can't be
out here swinging hockey sticks.

395
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,849
You're not even supposed to
be out here without skates.

396
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:55,683
Now get out!

397
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:56,384
All right.

398
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:57,385
Out!

399
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,888
Okay, we're leaving.

400
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,890
You know what, Charlie?

401
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:02,824
I think he's right, dude.

402
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:05,560
Only a couple of jabronis come
out here without skates on.

403
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,762
I got to do this thing
in skates, man.

404
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,697
You know, work up a routine,
really jazz the crowd.

405
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:10,765
Yeah, can I stop you, though?

406
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,399
Yeah.

407
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:15,737
You keep using this word "jabroni," and...
it's awesome.

408
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,739
It's, like, the
coolest word ever.

409
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:18,439
Is that, like, a hockey thing?

410
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,107
Yeah, I don't know.

411
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,642
It's-- I think it's some dego
word, but it sounds like a

412
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,142
hockey word.

413
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,443
It does sound...
You're gonna want to brush up

414
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:23,678
on your hockey words
at the beach house.

415
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:26,447
You're going to be hanging
out with the Flyers.

416
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,832
Okay, we are back.

417
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,999
Dennis and Dee Reynolds here.

418
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,501
Uh, we're back to the podcast.

419
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,702
We got a little derailed earlier.

420
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,203
We did.

421
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,970
We did, but that's okay.

422
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,205
We're going to get back on track here.

423
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:39,072
Let's try and get back on track.

424
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,041
I got a hot topic that I
want to talk about, Dee.

425
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:41,842
Tell me what it is.

426
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,243
Well, this is something I'm
pretty charged up about.

427
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:43,810
Mm-hmm.

428
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:44,978
It's stem cell research.

429
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:45,712
Good one.

430
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,080
It's a very divisive issue these days.

431
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:47,814
Excellent one.

432
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,150
People are really going to town,
one side against the other.

433
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:51,051
Some people are for it.

434
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:51,885
Oh, absolutely.

435
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:52,786
Some people are against it.

436
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:55,155
What are you doing?

437
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:56,156
That was a duck.

438
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,725
Why would you make a duck noise e e
right in the middle of my thing?

439
00:11:58,793 --> 00:11:59,359
I was doing a thing.

440
00:11:59,427 --> 00:11:59,860
It was funny.

441
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,460
It's a duck noise.

442
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:01,194
Yeah, but you derailed us.

443
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,462
I thought it upped the
production value.

444
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,163
It's not.

445
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:04,331
You know, add some sound effects.

446
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:04,898
Well, don't.

447
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,234
Okay, well... Okay, so stem cell research...

448
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:07,801
Stop doing that.

449
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,302
Stem cell research is a
very--

450
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,404
Why are you still...
Stop pushing sound effects.

451
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,640
I want to talk about--

452
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,574
Which one was that one?

453
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,909
This one.

454
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:18,812
It's a laser beam.

455
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,213
Yeah.

456
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,214
I like that one.

457
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,215
You like that one.

458
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,617
Yeah, I want to pepper that one in.

459
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:24,150
Okay.

460
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,385
Don't do it while I'm talking.

461
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:25,886
All right.

462
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,553
Well, we'll see.

463
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,721
Hey, Frank!

464
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,422
That's Frank Reynolds, everybody.

465
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,824
I have a great topic for you.

466
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:31,825
War.

467
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:32,826
War!

468
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:33,960
War?

469
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:34,494
Good one.

470
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,696
Everyone's talking about the war.

471
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:38,498
And I have the perfect guest.

472
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,066
Okay, all right.

473
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,368
Ben the soldier.

474
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:42,068
Hey, Dee.

475
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:42,769
Good to see you.

476
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:43,570
What are you doing?

477
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,571
No. No, no, no.

478
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,843
I'm not comfortable with this.

479
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:50,477
happening here.

480
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:51,177
Is the war happening here?

481
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:51,811
I don't know.

482
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,779
Let's get into all this stuff.

483
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:53,413
All right, great.

484
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,682
Ben the soldier's here with us,
folks, and I want to talk to

485
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,385
him, because, Ben, it's my
understanding that there is a

486
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,153
war going on right now.

487
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:00,687
Mm-hmm.

488
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:01,988
Am I right in this?

489
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,958
Well, actually, there
are two wars right now.

490
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:05,692
Two wars?

491
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,493
You don't say.

492
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,729
We're in the midst of two wars all
at once-- Now, the United States of

493
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,365
America is engaged in
both of these wars?

494
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,533
Yes. Yes, they are.

495
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:17,504
And are either of these wars
happening on U.S. soil?

496
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,172
Ben...
Excuse me.

497
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,341
Let me, let me, let me--
What is your job in the war?

498
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,844
Are you a carrier of-of,
uh, large weaponry?

499
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:29,282
Let me just-- How about if we talk
about how you used to bang each other?

500
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,916
Yeah.

501
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:30,417
No.

502
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:32,886
What kind of technique did you use
and tie-ups and stuff like that?

503
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:33,720
Frank, Frank.

504
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:34,721
Tie-ups.

505
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:35,522
It's not good radio.

506
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:36,356
'Cause people like sex.

507
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,992
Okay, well, let's... Okay, I just want
to clarify what my producer Frank is

508
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,695
actually referring to is the
fact that Ben, our soldier here,

509
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,330
and Dee used to be lovers.

510
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:45,865
Don't do that to me.

511
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:46,499
Don't do that to me.

512
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:47,133
That's a good one!

513
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:48,468
That's not funny.

514
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,369
It's not.

515
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,370
You're in the hot seat, girl.

516
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,304
I'm not in the hot seat.

517
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:51,972
Yes, you are.

518
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,906
Yes, you're in the hot seat.

519
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,607
Ben's in the hot seat.

520
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:57,310
All right, Mac, so you're
going to come on the ice and

521
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,778
fire out to center, right?

522
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,548
Do, like, a cool turn and
get the crowd going.

523
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,550
Okay, so fire out...
Come on.

524
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:04,551
Huh?

525
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:05,218
What are you do...?

526
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:06,219
Huh?

527
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:07,220
That's not cool.

528
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:10,223
Wait, do you not know
how to ice-skate?

529
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,193
No, not at all, but I figured you would
teach me 'cause we got plenty of time.

530
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,860
We don't have time.

531
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:15,228
It's tomorrow night, man!

532
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:17,430
Charlie, you got to help me,
dude, this is my big break.

533
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:18,298
Come on!

534
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,234
Oh, my God.

535
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,870
All right, we got a lot of work to do.

536
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:25,572
All right, here, grab the stick.

537
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,573
Ready?

538
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,540
Uh-huh.

539
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:28,541
And we'll start slow.

540
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:30,543
Oh, my-- this is going
to take forever, man.

541
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,379
That's good.

542
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,147
That's good, that's good.

543
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:35,148
I'm skating.

All right, Dennis, let's
get this over with.

Well, don't bring her in

No, no, it's good.

It's going to get not funny
after a little while.

Oops.

00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:18,151
Let's stop.

All right, well, so let me
understand this waitress.

572
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,355
Frank promised you an apology from me.

573
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,957
And now, you didn't
believe him, did you?

574
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,559
Yeah.

575
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,560
Really?

576
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:29,195
Okay, well, that makes you
incredibly gullible and stupid.

577
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,797
Oh, oh, oh, don't take that from him.

578
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,732
Are you gonna take that from him?

579
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,067
You stand up for yourself.

580
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,303
I'm not leaving here until
you apologize to me.

581
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,239
You're gonna be here for a while.

582
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:41,107
She's boring me.

583
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:44,144
I'll give you 50 bucks if you
take off your top and you drink

584
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,078
soup out of my shoe.

585
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,079
What?

586
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:48,014
Okay, now, that I'd like to see.

587
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:48,882
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

588
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:49,649
What do you say, sister?

589
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,416
You need some extra cash?

590
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:51,417
No.

591
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:53,453
500 bucks.

592
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:54,754
Cricket, bring us some soup.

593
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:57,590
You'd pay me $500 to drink
soup out of a shoe?'

594
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,692
And take your top off.

595
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,766
Fine, I'll do it.

596
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:07,433
Oh, nice.

597
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,434
Oh!

598
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:10,770
But I am not taking my top off.

599
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,405
Well, that's a relief to all of us.

600
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,040
Oh, zing, gotcha.

601
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,677
Couldn't find soup, but I
found some dirty dishwater.

602
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:23,149
Boom, even better.

603
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:26,753
Oh, my God!

604
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,157
Oh, now this is good radio!

605
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,199
Holy shit, dude, there's
a lot of people here.

606
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm getting nervous, Charlie.

607
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:46,271
Yeah, you might throw up when you get
out there, you know, from the nerves.

608
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,907
You're supposed to be my coach, dude,
don't tell me I'm going to throw up.

609
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,009
I know when people do that,
so try not to throw up.

610
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,077
Oh, come on, dude.

611
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:53,211
Mac, Charlie, what's up?

612
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,747
Oh, hey, you guys came to support me.

613
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:56,948
Uh, yeah, yeah.

614
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,984
Yeah, yeah, that's why we're here.

615
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:01,520
Primarily, yeah, but... But also, you
know, since we're here, we wanted to give

616
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:03,522
you this tape so you could
give it to those radio guys.

617
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,456
That's our demo tape.

618
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:06,158
We were recording the whole
thing on a computer, but then

619
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,592
the computer got water
dumped all over it.

620
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,360
It was a whole thing.

621
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,127
Luther Vandross?

622
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:09,895
Is that still on there?

623
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:11,663
Oh, that's very off-putting, Dennis.

624
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:12,998
Yeah, we should have relabeled it.

625
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:13,699
It's not Luther Vandross.

626
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,300
Make sure you tell him
it's not Luther Vandross.

627
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:16,068
All right, let's get going.

628
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:17,402
Shh.

629
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,906
Mac from South Philly, get out here.

630
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:23,709
This is you.

631
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:24,943
Here we go, here we go.

632
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:27,212
Everybody, say a prayer.

633
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,384
Let's do this.

634
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:33,819
Give him the tape.

635
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,942
What is that?

636
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:59,945
The future of radio, you jabronis.

637
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:03,715
Jabronis-- cool word.

638
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,415
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!

639
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:40,619
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!

640
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:43,655

Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!

644

Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!

645
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,267
Wake up, Mac.

646
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,768
Mac, Mac, wake up.

647
00:19:57,837 --> 00:19:59,838
Mac, wake up.

648
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:00,839
What happened?

649
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,307
Did I do good, Charlie?

650
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,811
No, you fell on your face
almost immediately, man.

651
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:06,812
Who took the shot?

652
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:07,846
I took the shot.

653
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,948
Yeah, I-I missed wide
right by, like, a mile.

654
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,449
It was terrible.

655
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:13,819
Look on the bright side, dude,
I think you're going to be a

656
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:15,987
sports celebrity after all
'cause they're definitely going

657
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,557
to play that shit on ESPN.
