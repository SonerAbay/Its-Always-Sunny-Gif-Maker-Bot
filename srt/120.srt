1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,529
<i>You really think
Jack can handle this case?</i>

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:05,017
<i>Yeah, he's a lawyer.</i>

3
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:06,252
<i>Besides, Bill, you're broke.</i>

4
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:07,721
He's the best lawyer
you can afford.

5
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:09,222
Yeah, Bill, you got to relax,
okay? Uncle Jack

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,858
and I-- we got this case.
Now-now, listen to me.

7
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:13,593
Liam McPoyle's gonna
come at you hard, all right?

8
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,728
But-but I've done my research.
I got something with this

9
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,096
bird theory, it's gonna
blow the court away. I-I...

10
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:18,564
I don't... I don't think
we should pursue

11
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,032
this bird nonsense, Charlie.
Yes.

12
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,667
I-I'm well-versed in bird law.
Look,

13
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,103
Pondy, keep your
eye on the prize.

14
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,239
This goes well, it's party time.

15
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:27,690
What is that?

16
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,508
Is that... is that drugs, Frank?
Yeah.

17
00:00:29,577 --> 00:00:30,810
No, dude, I need you
keeping him clean,

18
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,994
all right?
That's why you're here.

19
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,879
I got to have the drugs here

20
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:33,980
to keep him clean.

21
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,215
Well, that doesn't make sense.

22
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,399
I... Get rid
of the drugs, Frank.

23
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:37,984
I-I don't want that.
Hey, boys.

24
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,136
You ready for the big show?
Yes, good, how you feeling?

25
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:41,604
You good, you do your homework, you
know your talking points? Yeah.

26
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:43,406
Yeah, I'm good.
Yeah, cool as a cucumber.

27
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,174
You can... you can get off my back.
Well, don't sass me,

28
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,093
I just... It was just a general
Well, then don't hound me.

29
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,281
question, Dee. I'm just saying
if you don't want sass,

30
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,997
then you should probably stop being
a hound. All right, whatever.

31
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:52,698
Mac, why are you here?

32
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:55,301
This is your big day, dude.
McPoyle suing Ponderosa?

33
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,236
It's huge, it's like the
trial of the century.

34
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,505
Come on, man, everybody's got
a thing. Don't leave me out.

35
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:02,708
Frank's got a thing, Dee's got a
thing. Dennis has got a thing.

36
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:03,976
Dennis has a thing--
what are you talking about?

37
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,913
Oh!
D... What are you doing here?

38
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,180
There's got to be a way
to get this court

39
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:09,682
to let me out
of my alimony payments.

40
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,034
I mean, you guys seen Maureen?
The woman has gone

41
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,386
almost full cat.
It's-it's madness.

42
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:14,937
I shouldn't have
to pay for that,

43
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:16,789
so I'm gonna talk to the judge,
get him to throw it

44
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:17,957
on the docket,
you know what I mean?

45
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:19,425
No, absolutely not.

46
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:20,710
That's gonna distract
from my case.

47
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:21,644
Buddy, you don't
have a case, okay?

48
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,195
You are not a lawyer.

49
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:24,797
Uncle Jack's just
got you here handling

50
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,148
his papers for him
'cause he can't do it

51
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:27,500
'cause he's wearing
those goddamn...

52
00:01:27,568 --> 00:01:29,735
big hands over his hands.

53
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,871
I don't know what that is. What is that?
I don't know what it is.

54
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:33,556
All right, well, either way,
this whole thing's gonna be

55
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,191
a goddamn fiasco, and I'm gonna
enjoy every second of it.

56
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:37,159
No, it's gonna go fine.
No, it isn't.

57
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:39,125
No, it's gonna be fine.
This is hardly the trial

58
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,014
of the century. Everything's
gonna go just great.

60
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:07,722
On a scale of one to ten,
how much sass

61
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:10,099
are you gonna give me today?
A-Are you serious?

62
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,170
And hello to... you all.

63
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:14,805
What's the Jew lawyer
doing here?

64
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,423
Not Jewish, and even if I was,

65
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,592
what difference would it make?

66
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:20,177
I meant that as a compliment.

67
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,646
Everybody knows
Jews are the best lawyers.

68
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,265
I can't wait
to crush you people.

69
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,084
I'll be representing
Liam McPoyle today.

70
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,569
Where is Liam? Well, he
actually got pinkeye

71
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:31,388
in his one good eye.

72
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:34,057
Well, in truth, someone
named Doc McPoyle

73
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:37,027
attempted to put some sort of
healing milk in his pinkeye

74
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,839
and it got infected,
but that doesn't matter.

75
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:40,363
The point is...

76
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:42,799
you'll be dealing with me today.

77
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,801
And you'll be dealing
with me today.

78
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,536
Jack Kelly, lawyer.

79
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:48,688
Good to see you again.

80
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:50,574
Are those fake hands?

81
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:53,443
No.
Are those fake hands?

82
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:56,363
You know what, good luck
with all of that today.

83
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:02,619
Did you see his hands?
They're beautiful.

84
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,528
I think we should settle.
What... Jesus Christ.

85
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,656
I'm going to prison.
It's gonna be fine.

86
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:08,258
67th District Court
is now in session.

87
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Judge Clarence Melvoy presiding.

88
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,445
Please remove your hats and
turn off your cell phones.

89
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:16,099
Okay. We have
<i>McPoyle v. Ponderosa.</i>

90
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,685
Seeking damages for the loss
of an eye in the form

91
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,371
of a one-time payment
to the sum of...

92
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,740
$200.

93
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,141
Are the plaintiffs present?

94
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:26,227
I will be representing

95
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:27,410
the plaintiffs, Your Honor.

96
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,679
The defendants?
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

97
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:32,716
And I just, uh, wanted to say
I'm very excited

98
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,951
to be here.
I do estate law,

99
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:36,970
and this is my first
actual trial.

100
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,990
Uh, Your Honor, and if I may,
uh, Charlie Kelly, cocounsel.

101
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,125
Uh, background
in bird law, uh...

102
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:45,161
Nephew. Yeah. But excited to
be, uh, in the people's court

103
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,479
a-and a big fan
of black judges,

104
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,031
too.
Stop touching me.

105
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,084
Okay. Look.

106
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,403
All I need are the facts
to this case.

107
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,305
I have a very long
day ahead of me,

108
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:58,775
so I'm gonna need
to keep this thing moving.

109
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:00,677
Are you gonna bang the, uh...
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:03,113
the-the hammer?
Do we... Is there a...

111
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:05,682
Okay, we good?

112
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,050
Hey. Okay. Cool.

113
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,234
Awesome.
Yeah.

114
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,819
It's cool, right?
Yeah, nice.

115
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:12,022
<i>Your Honor,</i>

116
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:15,258
Friday the 13th
was a night of chaos.

117
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,693
Milk,

118
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,162
spiked with bath salts
by this man,

119
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,364
Bill Ponderosa,

120
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,566
was served
to the wedding guests.

121
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:26,202
Now, my client is odd.

122
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:28,822
You might even
refer to his family as...

123
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,642
...very creepy.

124
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,577
But they are saints compared

125
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,262
to Bill Ponderosa

126
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,615
and the sordid lot
of degenerates

127
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,450
he associates with.

128
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:43,320
Terrible people who ruin lives.

129
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,822
Ruined mine,
cost my client his marriage,

130
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:48,692
ruined my first,
now my second one is teetering.

131
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,344
You know what...

132
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,896
I'm gonna sit down.

133
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:54,331
I'm done.

134
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,967
They just do this to me, okay?

135
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,035
You get the point.

136
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:00,754
Uh, Your Honor, I'll-I'll, uh,

137
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,055
I'll keep it brief.

138
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,708
I just have three things to say.

139
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,444
Uh, one:

140
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:11,014
Liam McPoyle
has a history of lying.

141
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,516
Two: My client
is a loving

142
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:16,019
family man.

143
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:18,121
And three:

144
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,256
He is innocent.

145
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,895
<i>Deandra Reynolds,</i>

146
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:28,331
you were the one that
told the police that Bill had

147
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:30,900
spiked the punch with bath salts.
That's correct.

148
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:32,902
But you didn't actually
see him do it, did you?

149
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,672
No, I did not.
So is it possible that,

150
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,708
given the traumatic nature
of the evening,

151
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:40,844
that you don't
remember the evening

152
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,846
all that well?
Yes, that's correct.

153
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,731
My car was destroyed and I
was locked into a freezer.

154
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,332
My memory was clouded by rage,

155
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,101
and so I misremembered
the incident.

156
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:51,588
An understandable mistake.
Could happen to any one of us.

157
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:54,257
For example,
you remember me, possibly,

158
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,393
as a man with small hands.

159
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:58,161
Yeah, you think...

160
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,963
What... you think, "He
had small hands."

161
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,032
Do you remember that?

162
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,165
Yeah, sure, okay.

163
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:04,601
What you remember is false.

164
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:05,568
O-Okay.
Yup.

165
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:07,504
Big, masculine.

166
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:09,873
My hands tell a story

167
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,925
of greatness.

168
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,177
- And when you look at my right hand...
- I'm gonna st...

169
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:15,979
uh, uh, I'm gonna stop you

170
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,280
right now.
Are you just gonna

171
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,882
talk about your hands
for a while?

172
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:21,117
Uh, no, Your Honor.

173
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,820
No more questions
for the witness.

174
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,488
Deandra,

175
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,590
here is the statement
that you gave

176
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:28,992
to police.

177
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,760
"Bill did it.
That goddamn drug addict

178
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,929
"is out of his mind.
I'll testify to that.

179
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,964
"I swear on my mother's
grave that Bill spiked

180
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,566
"that milk, no doubt about it.

181
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:39,135
He's guilty, guilty, guilty."

182
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:40,320
Uh...

183
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:41,488
Have you ever had sex

184
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,807
with Bill before?

185
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,358
Yeah.

186
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,743
Yes, sure.
Because we-we were...

187
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,678
We had a... We were sort of...

188
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,196
We were lovers for a little...

189
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,015
One of his prostitutes, right.

190
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,583
Prostitutes?

191
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:57,587
Um, I have a receipt
for a mink coat,

192
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:59,122
recently purchased
by a Bill Ponderosa

193
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:02,926
to be delivered
to a Dee Reynolds.

194
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,911
A gift?

195
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,263
Yes. I had a birthday.

196
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:08,465
Six months ago.

197
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,533
Uh...
Are you aware

198
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,134
that the coat was purchased

199
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:13,970
at Doyle McPoyle's
Trappings and Fur?

200
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,171
No.
Or that the coat

201
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,639
was not made of mink at all

202
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,109
but rather made of... muskrat?

203
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:22,011
Muskrat? Goddamn muskrat?
Are you kidding me,

204
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,330
Bill? Okay, you know
what, fine, he spiked it.

205
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,016
I'm sorry. What did you say?

206
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:28,751
He spiked it, and then
he tried to bribe me.

207
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,906
No further questions,
Your Honor.

208
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:35,942
Ma'am, do you know
what perjury is?

209
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:38,228
Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:39,913
<i>Oh, this is terrible.</i>

211
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:41,414
Well, he shouldn't be...
This is terrible.

212
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,932
Wow, you guys are getting
crushed in there.

213
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,684
Yeah. Oh, I know.
Hey, thanks, Mac. Hi. Great.

214
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,703
Hey, you know, I feel like
I'm not being utilized properly.

215
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:48,004
Well, that's 'cause
you don't have anything.

216
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:49,489
So you're not being
utilized at all.

217
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,494
Yeah, but what if I get
to deliver the bombshell?

218
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:54,144
Oh.
What bombshell?

219
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,462
You guys don't have
a bombshell? Oh, my God.

220
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,448
Every good case
needs a bombshell.

221
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,049
Oh, Jesus Christ,
and, without it,

222
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,318
you're screwed. You know
what, you know what? Okay.

223
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,287
I'll find one for you. I'm
gonna do, like, a hero cop,

224
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:05,688
Mark Fuhrman thing...
Oh, Mark Furhman. No...

225
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:06,856
and then sort of transition
into a Kato Kaelin.

226
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,675
Yeah, I wish you
would do none of it.

227
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,926
Okay. All right. Cool. I wish
you'd do none of it, man.

228
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,394
I'm on it, I'm on it.
Okay. All right.

229
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,329
Ah, why can't people
just stay out of this?

230
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,131
Yeah, look, there's potentially...
That-That's my bird expert.

231
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,784
He's from Penn. The guy... Like,
he's totally official, okay?

232
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,969
Let me do the bird thing. He's an
ornithologist. I don't think it's a good...

233
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,504
I'm gonna kill, man. I know,
but, Charlie, I'm just...

234
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:22,655
Uncle Jack, put me back on the stand.
What?

235
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:24,207
No, we cannot.
Are you kidding me?

236
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,675
You're lucky you didn't
get sent to jail.

237
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,143
Yeah, I know.
But I think this could work.

238
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:28,711
I'm gonna say
I found some bullshit online

239
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,664
that proves that lawyer's Jewish.
Oh.

240
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,184
So what? So what? He'll
be a laughingstock.

241
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,419
Yes. Yes. Right?

242
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,937
Because the man is Jewish?

243
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,825
No. What? No. Not because he's...
Well, that's what

244
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:45,094
it sounds like you're saying. N-Not
because he's Jewish. Because he's a liar

245
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:46,679
and because he's embarrassed
about being Jewish.

246
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,031
I mean, what is that?

247
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:49,415
Dee, you blew it.
Like, big-time.

248
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,801
I wish you guys would just stay
out of this.

249
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:54,038
I-I didn't... I-I...

250
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,749
Maureen, you are the sister
of Bill Ponderosa,

251
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,619
and it was at your wedding
that Liam got attacked?

252
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,279
Meow.
Mmm.

253
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,701
Your Honor, nothing represents
the tragic aftermath

254
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:11,205
more than the dramatic
transformation of this woman...

255
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:13,329
Uh, cat.
Excuse me?

256
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:14,980
As I transition
from woman to cat,

257
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:18,567
I must insist on being
referred to as a cat.

258
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,953
Objection.
She's not a cat, Your Honor.

259
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,424
If the witness wants to consider
herself a cat, I will allow it.

260
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,026
I just need to know
where all this is headed.

261
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:28,661
How is this relevant?

262
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,262
Well, it's clearly relevant

263
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:32,331
the attack had
a psychological impact

264
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,934
on all the parties that evening.

265
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,119
No further questions.

266
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:40,606
Y-Your Honor, do you see what's
going on here? This is crazy.

267
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:43,542
You know what, I'm gonna... I'm
gonna approach the bench. No.

268
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:45,611
Can I just approach it real fast?
Absolutely not.

269
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,264
All right, earlier, you-you
referred to my ex-wife as a cat,

270
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:51,117
per her request. Uh, now,
surely, you wouldn't force a man

271
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:53,119
to pay alimony to a cat, right?

272
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:56,288
So motion to establish me not
having to pay alimony anymore.

273
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:58,591
I will not allow that. Okay, well, so can
we just... we'll pop it on the docket?

274
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,539
We can put it at the end
of the day if you want.

275
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,545
I just want to clear it up
while I got her in a courtroom.

276
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,897
I will not allow that, either.
Sit down.

277
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,832
Now you don't allow something.
Now you don't allow something!

278
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:08,868
Allow all this.
You gonna allow that?

279
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,371
You know? But you don't...
Okay, I'm good. Goddamn it.

280
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,873
<i>Frank,</i>

281
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,142
did you go to the wedding?
I did.

282
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,911
And I snuck Ryan up in
the trunk of my car.

283
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,348
He hadn't been invited to the wedding,
on account of the beef with Liam.

284
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,017
And I had him in the trunk of the car, on
account of I didn't want to sit with him

285
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,419
'cause he's gross.
Right.

286
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:29,088
And, uh, uh,

287
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:32,324
what did Ryan say to you
when you got to the wedding?

288
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,643
"I'm gonna kill
Maureen Ponderosa."

289
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:38,848
So, if there's someone to point
the finger at, it would be...

290
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,000
his brother!

291
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:44,236
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God, nobody look!

292
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:46,655
Nobody look! Nobody look!

293
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:49,074
Nobody look!
Nobody look!

294
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:50,509
Nobody look!

295
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,462
Now, you've stabbed

296
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,214
your brother before, correct?

297
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,966
Oh, sure.

298
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:58,400
And you were upset
at the wedding.

299
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:02,188
So it's not crazy
for me to ask you this.

300
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:05,558
Ryan McPoyle, did you attack
your brother at the wedding?

301
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,794
Oh. I'm not Ryan.

302
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:11,697
What? You're not?
No.

303
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm Lion. Like the animal.

304
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:15,951
Lion McPoyle.

305
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:18,020
Wh-Why are you on the stand?

306
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:19,705
Because you said "his brother"

307
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:21,774
and threw your big fake hand
at me.

308
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,176
O-Okay. Ryan's at home with Liam,
taking care of his infected eye.

309
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,811
Okay, uh, uh, boy, let's, uh,

310
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,631
str-strike that, uh,
hand comment from the record.

311
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:31,083
Uh, would you happen to know

312
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,185
if Ryan stabbed his brother
in the eye?

313
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:35,020
Oh, yeah. I know.
He totally did it.

314
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,056
Well, then I guess

315
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:39,358
we will never know,
ladies and gentlemen.

316
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:41,060
Uncle Jack, he just confessed!

317
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,695
He did?
Yes!

318
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,797
Yeah, Ryan stabbed Liam.
I totally saw it.

319
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,615
Oh, my God! We won!

320
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,786
We did it!
We did it. How did I do it?

321
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:53,489
Lion, was Ryan drinking milk
at the wedding?

322
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:55,207
Of course. Everyone was.

323
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,444
So who did the stabbing
doesn't matter, Your Honor,

324
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,312
because they were all
still drugged

325
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:03,282
on Bill Ponderosa's spiked milk,

326
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:06,318
which is the point I've been
trying to make the entire time.

327
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,788
So just to be clear,
you've proven my case.

328
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:12,074
You lose.

329
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,327
I
can't follow any of this.

330
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:18,247
What? Guys, guys, I got it.

331
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:19,765
You-you got what?

332
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,401
I got the bombshell.

333
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,236
<i>Okay, Mr. McDonald,</i>

334
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:27,690
you recently found out some
very interesting information.

335
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,792
Care to share it with the court?

336
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:32,194
Yes. I've recently been informed

337
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,482
that Ryan McPoyle
only drinks mother's milk!

338
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,517
Which means there's no way

339
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:41,487
he could have drank the
milk that Bill spiked,

340
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,906
which means he was sober
when he attacked his brother,

341
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,591
which means Bill is innocent!

342
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,127
Case closed! Kaboom!

343
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,979
Bombshell!

344
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:53,082
I did it. I did it,
black judge. I did it.

345
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Mr... Mr. McDonald, how did you
come upon this information?

346
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,537
Oh, I banged Margaret McPoyle.
I'm curious

347
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,740
how she told you,
because Margaret is a mute.

348
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:05,144
Well, guess what, smart guy,
I had her write it down.

349
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:09,898
One more thing, Your Honor.
Margaret, you carry a picture

350
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,284
of Mother with you at
all times, don't you?

351
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,069
Do you mind showing
that to the court?

352
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,445
Your Honor,

353
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:26,131
"Mother" is the name
of the McPoyle family cow.

354
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,317
The cow that provided the milk
for the wedding.

355
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,386
The milk that was drugged by...

356
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:33,656
Bill Ponderosa.

357
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:36,558
That mute bitch
lied to me for sex.

358
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:38,327
Bombshell diffused.

359
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,079
Abramowitz!

360
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,782
Your great-grandmother's
last name was Abramowitz.

361
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,551
I found it
on an ancestry Web site.

362
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:51,824
That makes you a dirty liar
because you are Jewish.

363
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,811
Okay, I...
That came out kind of bad.

364
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:58,163
I-I'm not disgusted
by the Jewish part.

365
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,099
It's the... it's the<i> lying</i> part
that I was talking about.

366
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,435
This dirty liar is a Jew...

367
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,304
ish man.

368
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,539
Recess?

369
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,224
<i>Oh, God!</i>

370
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,976
Oh, that stupid Dee.
All right, calm down, calm down.

371
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,778
Look, as the great
Johnnie Cochran once said,

372
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,663
if the glove
doesn't fit, give up.

373
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:16,548
That's not what he said!
That's not... It...

374
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:17,914
How are you a lawyer, Jack? I...

375
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:19,885
I mean, I know more than
you. All right, look...

376
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:21,587
Watch your voice. Watch your voice.
Okay, okay, let's just...

377
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,138
let me do my bird
thing. Okay, Bill,

378
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:24,757
I want to do the bird thing.
Can we just do it...?

379
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,308
Yeah, that's great. No,
let's do the bird thing.

380
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:27,943
You're good with it now?
Okay. Love it, yeah.

381
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,396
Jesus, son, what'd you cut this with?
Shut up, bitch.

382
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,398
Son? Your... This is...
Your son is your dealer?

383
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,799
He's reliable.

384
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,534
Oh, God. Frank, what
are you doing, man?

385
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,703
Come on, reign it in.
I paid for it.

386
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,938
I'm gonna do it. Hey, fat ass,
this asshole's short 30 bucks.

387
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:42,207
Go steal another set of my
golf clubs, you piece of shit.

388
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:44,276
you. Forget it.
Piss off.

389
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:46,078
Guys, guys, we're doing the bird
theory, all right? All right.

390
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:48,063
All right. All right. All right.
I'm taking the lead here, okay?

391
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,782
Yeah. All right, let's do it.
Birds on three.

392
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:51,817
One, two, three. Birds!
Those are just ridiculous.

393
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,753
It's like three hands... like
eight hands out there. Yeah.

394
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:56,372
<i>Your Honor,</i>

395
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,157
this is the McPoyle
family crest.

396
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,659
On it you will find a bird--

397
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:03,228
a Pocono swallow,
to be more accurate.

398
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,897
A very rare, very elusive bird.

399
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,298
You'll notice its trademark

400
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:09,601
unibrow, highly uncommon
in most aviary circles.

401
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:11,236
And my research shows

402
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:14,139
that unlike your typical
North American barn swallow,

403
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,942
the Pocono swallow, if kept
under the proper conditions,

404
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,778
can live as long as 80
to even 85 years,

405
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,513
much like a parrot

406
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:23,916
or some of the more resilient
coastal gulls.

407
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,518
Your Honor, where is this going?

408
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:29,955
I don't know, but it
better lead somewhere fast.

409
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,390
Your Honor, I can assure you

410
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,899
that this will be
our final argument.

411
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:34,460
Well, if it's gonna help
end all of this madness,

412
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,811
I'll allow it.

413
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,162
Thank you, Your Honor.

414
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:39,131
Now, there was another member

415
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,833
of the McPoyle family clan
at the wedding

416
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,301
the night of the incident.

417
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,570
A member
that none of us have met.

418
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:46,538
Certainly not anyone
on this side of the aisle.

419
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,142
A one Mr. Royal McPoyle.

420
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:53,162
A bird. The McPoyle family's

421
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:55,848
pet Pocono swallow,
and my research shows

422
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,316
that this particular
Pocono swallow

423
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,635
has a history of violence.

424
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,538
Look into the gallery, and
you will see Royal's victims.

425
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:04,823
It took Margaret's
vocal cords in 1999,

426
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:06,859
leaving her mute.

427
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:08,794
Keith McPoyle lost his eyes
and his ears

428
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:11,096
to it in '76, and we all know

429
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,365
that according to bird law,
it's three strikes,

430
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,167
and you're out.

431
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,703
Bye, bye, birdie.

432
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:20,372
Ready, boys and girls, because
here's where it gets good.

433
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,091
Ryan McPoyle didn't
attack Liam. Royal did.

434
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,778
And Lion was<i> lying</i> about
Ryan attacking Liam

435
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:27,279
to protect Royal from the chair.

436
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:28,881
Or lethal injection.

437
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,649
Or perhaps some sort of
small bird guillotine.

438
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,184
I wouldn't understand
the physics of it.

439
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:34,019
I'm not an executioner.

440
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:36,789
I'm just the best goddamn
bird lawyer in the world.

441
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,909
So, bottom line-- and
listen up, numbnuts,

442
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,595
'cause it blows a
hole in your case--

443
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,498
birds don't drink milk.

444
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,000
Objection, Your Honor.

445
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,602
There's no Royal McPoyle.

446
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:53,705
Perhaps, or perhaps not.

447
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:58,076
Your Honor, I call Pappy McPoyle
to the stand.

448
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:01,914
Pappy McPoyle, patriarch
of the McPoyle family.

449
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:05,350
Royal was your pet bird. You've
had him since you were a boy.

450
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:08,120
And isn't it true that you never
go anywhere without him?

451
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,771
Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,657
I have seen...

453
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,042
raccoons and oysters dancing...

454
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,061
in the head of a pin
with the angels.

455
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,796
They are laughing.

456
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:19,431
All right, Your Honor,

457
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,567
clearly, this witness
is mentally unwell

458
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:24,052
and cannot answer any
of the questions properly...

459
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,538
Uh, perhaps, Your Honor,
or-or perhaps it's just a cover.

460
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:28,257
But it's quite all right.

461
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:30,142
I don't have
any further questions.

462
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:32,077
Oh, except one more.

463
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:35,781
Didn't the bailiff ask everyone
to remove their hats?

464
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:38,350
That is true.

465
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:40,085
Mr. McPoyle,

466
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,104
would you please
remove your hat?

467
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:45,757
Mmm... Mr. McPoyle,
please remove your hat.

468
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:48,160
Perhaps he is too insane
to understand the question.

469
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,546
Why don't I just...?

470
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:57,019
Ladies and gentlemen,
Royal McPoyle.

471
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,621
Chickadee, dee,
dee, little birdy.

472
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,006
Let's dance.

473
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:02,908
Your Honor, this is
Mr. Belka Meir.

474
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,943
He's a professor of ornithology
at the University of Penn.

475
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:06,395
Mr. Meir, it's
safe to say

476
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,113
you're a bit of an
expert on birds, yes?

477
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:09,965
I believe you're correct, yes.

478
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,884
And you would understand this
Pocono swallow quite well,

479
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,368
wouldn't you?
Yes, I do.

480
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,554
Then please ask it
if it attacked Liam!

481
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,223
Ask... if... What?

482
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,992
Mr. Meir, I would
like you to please talk

483
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,178
to the bird and say, "Did
you attack Liam McPoyle?!"

484
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:26,365
I can't converse with...
with a bird.

485
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,967
Well, I thought you were an expert on
birds. I am an expert on birds, but...

486
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,869
Well, I need you to
communicate with the bird.

487
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,771
- This is very important, and I need to...
- But it's a...

488
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:35,941
Well, this is
a bit embarrassing, Your Honor.

489
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:37,709
Perhaps this man
has lied about his credentials.

490
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:41,129
Uh, fortunately, I am familiar
with a little bit of pigeon.

491
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:44,116
Perhaps I can
get through to it in some way.

492
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:48,036
Okay.

493
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,755
Your Honor, this is nonsense.

494
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,857
Here, kitty.

495
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:53,825
Here, kitty. Chase the laser beam, kitty.

496
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:55,727
Order. Your Honor, you've got
a man speaking to a bird.

497
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:57,663
And yet, you refuse to rule

498
00:18:57,698 --> 00:19:00,132
on me having
to pay alimony to this cat.

499
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,516
What is this?!
Order!

500
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:02,517
It's a mockery of
justice, Your Honor.

501
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:04,670
This is ridiculous, and this...

502
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,739
I said, order!

503
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,708
He's talking to the pigeon!

504
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,643
I'm not paying alimony
to a goddamn cat!

505
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:14,212
Order!
I want order in this court!

506
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:15,714
Fly, my pet!

507
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,182
Fly!

508
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,769
Bring me their eyes!

509
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:26,892
Bring them to me!

510
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:28,962
Oh!

511
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,964
In my 35 years on this bench,

512
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,481
I have never seen such a mockery
made of this courtroom.

513
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:42,234
You people have wasted my time,

514
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,952
you've wasted
the taxpayers' time,

515
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,485
and this justice
has heard enough.

516
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:49,254
I am throwing this case out.

517
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,788
I should've done it hours ago.

518
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,123
He's throwing it out!
That means we win!

519
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,541
That means we win!
That means we won!

520
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,127
Damn, damn, damn!

521
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,712
Son of a bitch!
Order.

522
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,265
Damn! Damn it!

523
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Order!

524
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,635
This court has ruled.

525
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,687
Now, I suggest

526
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,555
that you people get
the hell out of my courtroom

527
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,390
before I put you all in jail.

528
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,808
You got it!
Get out!

529
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,694
Bailiff, next case.

530
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,113
It's ridiculous.

531
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,864
We have<i> Morgan State Delivery</i>

532
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,950
<i>v. the proprietors
of one Paddy's Pub.</i>

533
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:22,167
Oh! That's us. That's us, Your Honor.
Oh, that's us.

534
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,735
Oh, hell no! Uh-uh. Uh-uh!
All right!

535
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:35,292
