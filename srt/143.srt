1
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:04,636
<i>Mac, Mac, open up!</i>

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,638
<i>Let me in!
There's no time to waste! Come on!</i>

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,640
Come on, man! I know you're in there!

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,909
Oh, that's it! I'm coming in!

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,846
Ow! Oh, shit!

6
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,648
I just opened up the old cut.

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,467
Why didn't you open the door?

8
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,502
- It wasn't locked.
- Come on, we got to get going.

9
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:22,003
You got any ice in there? Ow.

10
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,805
They put me in charge.

11
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:26,628
It's a gay pride parade or something.

12
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:27,809
Can I use this sock?

13
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:29,673
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,461
We're making a float for the parade,
to rope in the gays.

15
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,699
Ow! But we only got 24 hours.

16
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,834
I'm gonna use this newspaper.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,565
I stuff it up. I plug it. Okay.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,573
Well, you're gonna be our prize gay.

19
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,239
You're gonna dance on top.
They told me to get you.

20
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,711
I told 'em,
"I don't get the whole gay thing."

21
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,981
I drew the short straw, so here I am.
Let's roll.

22
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,800
I-I don't want to do that,
because I-I just...

23
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,415
I don't know
where I fit in as a gay man,

24
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,738
and it's starting to get to me.

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,007
Oh, Christ!<i> Now?</i>

26
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,743
They give me one job and I got
to deal with your feelings?

27
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,729
I-I don't know. I-I...

28
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,614
I'm not feeling very proud.

29
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:09,129
A-All right.
Look, Mac, I never really got you.

30
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,958
And-and, to be honest,
now that you're gay,

31
00:01:11,993 --> 00:01:13,593
I get you even less.

32
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:14,572
Nothing against it.

33
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,574
I just don't get it.

34
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,375
But let's try and work together, okay?

35
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,846
Help me help you, all right?

36
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,647
All right. I guess. Sure.

37
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,599
Okay. Let's go find your pride.

38
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,503
_

39
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:52,643
Where exactly are you taking me, Frank?

40
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,580
Your problem is you're only
hanging out with straights.

41
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,411
I'm gonna take you to a club
where you can meet a few guys,

42
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:00,283
maybe snap you
out of that funk you're in.

43
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:03,472
All right. I just don't know if
I'm ready for a relationship, you know?

44
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,339
You're just scared, is all.

45
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,410
You got to meet a couple of normal gays.

46
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,546
And, by the way, when we're in there,
you got to watch my back.

47
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,433
If one of these queens comes at me,
I'm gonna go berserk.

48
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,502
Frank, you're a 75-year-old man with
a face that looks like hamburger meat.

49
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,569
I'm sure you're safe.

50
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,637
Yeah.

51
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,947
L-Let's try to blend in.

52
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,508
Okay.

53
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,579
Ooh.

54
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,266
Jesus Christ, Frank.

55
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,468
Isn't this what all gay guys are into?

56
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,404
I-I don't think so, but,
either way, I know I'm not into it.

57
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,739
A-All right, all right, relax.

58
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,475
Let's hit the buffet. We'll hang back.

59
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,330
We'll scope out the scene.

60
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,478
Okay? Ooh, look at that.

61
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:48,700
Ooh. This is a much better spread
than they have at the straight orgies.

62
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,769
- Yeah, I don't feel comfortable in here, Frank.
- Oh. Hmm.

63
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,439
I know. That's why
you got to jump in headfirst.

64
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,841
Go find some nice guys,
smack you around a little bit.

65
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,710
I don't want to get smacked around.

66
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,445
That's part of the culture, Mac.

67
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,580
It's a very small subset of the culture.

68
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,398
And it's totally fine for these guys,

69
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,268
but it's just a little too much for me.

70
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:08,803
Too... Ow. Oh, and this cut.

71
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,539
I got to take 'em out and restuff.

72
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,540
- Oh, God.
- Goddamn, dude, that is disgusting.

73
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,743
- Mm, I got to plug it. I got to plug it up.
- Oh!

74
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,745
- You're putting it in the chicken?
- Got to... Yeah.

75
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,414
- What are you... Oh, my God.
- No, I got to keep it plugged.

76
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,700
Ooh, ooh, ooh, that's spicy.

77
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,502
Ooh, there must be some hot
sauce on them wings.

78
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,143
They're buffalo wings.

79
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,706
- Let me try one.
- Don't eat the god... Oh, Frank.

80
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,376
Oh, look out. Incoming.

81
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,579
Um, how may we help you?

82
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,401
Mac, unzip this thing,
so we can find out what it wants.

83
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,471
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

84
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,739
Why? Because I'm straight?

85
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,609
No. Because you put your
nose rags in the chicken.

86
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:50,478
Oh, uh, excuse me, Your Highness,
I'll be more careful.

87
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:51,746
Hey, how much I got to pay you

88
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:54,499
to let my boy Mac here
take you for a spin?

89
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,900
I'm not a prostitute.

90
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,869
- You do this for fun?
- Yes.

91
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,438
I'm never gonna get it.
I'll never get this.

92
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,506
Why did I get this mission?

93
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,908
- I... You see, I drew the short straw.
- Okay.

94
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,777
- Uh, let's go, Frank. I'm so sorry, sir.
- That's it.

95
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,580
W-We'll be leaving.
Frank, let's just go home.

96
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,599
No, no, no. No, Goldilocks,
we're not going home.

97
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,535
You got to find that pride.

98
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,403
Okay, this place is a little too rough.

99
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,671
I-I admit it. Fine.

100
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:19,541
We're gonna go someplace softer.

101
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,544
♪ Oh, no, no, finally,
it has happened to me ♪

102
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,647
♪ Right in front of my face,
my feelings can't describe it... ♪

103
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,499
So, you see anything you like?

104
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,302
Not really.
These are drag queens, Frank.

105
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,475
Come on, Mac. Help me out.

106
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,806
I'm sticking my neck out for you
and you're giving me nothing.

107
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,575
How are you sticking
your neck out for me?

108
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm running a real risk
coming to a joint like this.

109
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,512
I mean, one false move

110
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,581
and these fairies could
poke me full of holes.

111
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,466
"Fairies"? What year is it in your head?

112
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,801
Well, help me out here, man.

113
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,603
We're running out of time.

114
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,538
When you came out to your father,
did you come out

115
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,606
as a top or a bottom?

116
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,873
A boy or a girl?

117
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,475
Oh, I haven't come out to him yet.

118
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,610
Well, maybe that's it.

119
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,479
You got to tell your dad.

120
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,349
Yeah, I-I just don't think
I can come out and tell him.

121
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,499
I-I feel like I got to show him.

122
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,487
And-and I've been working
on something, actually,

123
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,437
but it's just gonna take me
a few more weeks, so...

124
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,372
No, no, weeks, weeks, no.

125
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,773
We got to be on that float tomorrow.

126
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,575
Look... I don't know
what to tell you, man.

127
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,511
You just don't... you don't know
what's going on inside of me.

128
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,513
Well, I'm sure there's
five or six superviruses

129
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,665
- eating out your insides.
- No, no.

130
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:20,297
I mean the struggle to be who I am.

131
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,537
I-I just want to show him,
so that he can understand.

132
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,405
All right, well, explain it to me.

133
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,740
Okay, well, there's...

134
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,331
there's, like, this storm inside of me

135
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,478
and-and it's been raging my whole life.

136
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,431
And-and I'm down on my knees
and-and I'm-I'm looking

137
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:37,702
for answers and then God comes down
to me... and it's a very hot chick...

138
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,572
- and she pulls me up and we start dancing, okay?
- W-Wait, wait, wait.

139
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,574
You're gay and you're
dancing with a hot chick

140
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,509
- who is God?
- Yes.

141
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,911
- The Catholics really fucked you up.
- Oh, you didn't get it?

142
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,646
- I'm never gonna get it.
- Okay. All right.

143
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,515
- Let me start at the beginning, and I'll...
- No, no. Wait.

144
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,799
Christ, I'm sweating.

145
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:54,205
My-my head is exploding.

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,472
I'm gonna try some of this...
put a little of this.

147
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:58,806
It'll be good.

148
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:02,477
Ah! Ah!

149
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,677
Ah, shit!

150
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,380
Ah, that burns.

151
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,835
Oh, Christ, it's swelling.

152
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,504
Frank, I think your nose

153
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,439
- is infected, man.
- No, no, no, no.

154
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:18,376
I got... I'm using this insulation
to plug up the flow. I just...

155
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,378
Yeah, that seems safe.
Oh, shit! Here he comes.

156
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,580
- I'm freaking out.
- Don't-don't dance around it.

157
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,732
Just tell him. Rip the Band-Aid off.

158
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,467
- He'll be cool. You'll see.
- He'll be cool.

159
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,735
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's cool, he's cool.

160
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,404
Yeah.

161
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,538
- Go for it.
- Yeah.

162
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:33,375
H-Hey.

163
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,415
Hey, Dad! H-Hey, it's, uh...

164
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,454
it's-it's been a couple years.

165
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:43,835
- So, how you been?
- Yeah.

166
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,505
My cellmate ratted on me
for having an extra pillow.

167
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,641
I cut out his tongue with
a rusty pair of pliers

168
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,645
and fed it to the maggots.

169
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,798
Cool...

170
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,734
Very cool.

171
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,670
So, um...

172
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:03,804
there's something that, uh,

173
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,740
I've been meaning to
tell you for a while now.

174
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,343
Uh-huh...

175
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,545
All right, there's, like,
a storm inside of me, all right?

176
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:13,814
And-and-and... and God
sent me an angel...

177
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,434
- an angel, and this... this angel is a woman.
- No. Don't.

178
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,370
And this woman and I...
we start dancing,

179
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,638
and we get very passionate, and then...

180
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,440
It's all very confusing, but in the end,

181
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,442
something new is born.

182
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,512
Well, wha-what he's trying to say...

183
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,599
Oh, I know<i> exactly</i>
what he's trying to say.

184
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:36,471
My son... finally knocked someone up.

185
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,606
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

186
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:42,477
- Uh...
- Finally!

187
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,479
Someone to carry on my name.

188
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,633
Yeah, I mean...

189
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,701
You know, I-I could carry on your name.

190
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,904
Yeah. Son, listen to me.

191
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,641
I never really got you, you know?

192
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:00,378
But now,

193
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,581
I see that there's hope for you yet.

194
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,601
Well, I-I mean, not with your life,

195
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,537
but with the life of your son.

196
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,531
Well, we don't know
that it's gonna be a boy.

197
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,542
Hey, if it's not a boy,

198
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:17,811
you flush that shit out and try again!

199
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,614
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

200
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:20,748
I'll flush that shit out, and you...

201
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:22,433
I'm gonna give you a boy, Dad.

202
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,703
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

203
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,772
We will! Dad, you<i> are</i>
gonna be a grandfather. Daddy.

204
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,697
Uh, Dad? Dad?

205
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,510
Hey, Dad? Yeah, Dad.

206
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,712
Oh, no, he had to go.
The guards called him back.

207
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,447
The guards called him back.

208
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:38,795
Oh, that went well.

209
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:48,209
Frank? Frank?

210
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,346
- Ah! Ah, this goddamn cut!
- Yeah...

211
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,414
- Oh!
- Trying to plug it up.

212
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,339
- Whoa!
- But I can't stop it.

213
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:56,367
- Holy shit!
- Oh.

214
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,570
I'm using lemon juice and hot
glue to close up the wound.

215
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,306
- Uh, yeah, okay.
- Huh?

216
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,241
- All right, look, where's Mac, dude?
- Huh?

217
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,642
- Mac. You were supposed to get him. Where is he?
- Yeah!

218
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,178
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well, is he... is he here? Come on.

219
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,447
- He's coming.
- All right, well, good.

220
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,311
Well, he's super late, though. Come on.

221
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,268
No big deal if he doesn't do it, right?

222
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:16,137
I mean, we could find somebody else.

223
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,471
Someone else? Come on, come on.

224
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,541
What are you gonna have you, me,
dancing on top of the gay float?

225
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,076
- No.
- No, no, the press'll murder us!

226
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,478
- We need an authentically gay man.
- Huh.

227
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
They'll see right through it, man.
They'll kill us.

228
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,433
I didn't know you guys were
taking this so seriously.

229
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,500
We're taking it<i> very</i> seriously.

230
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,102
You know what?
I got something to show you.

231
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,503
Come look, okay?
That will change everything.

232
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,438
Hey-oh!

233
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,374
Holy shit!

234
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,509
- Yeah, right?
- Right? - Huh? Oh!

235
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,378
- I mean, this thing's amazing, man.
- Aw.

236
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,114
Like, it's got a working bar,
it's got these confetti cannons.

237
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,399
- Huh.
- It's even got, like, a shower

238
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:46,134
- that's gonna pour water on Mac...
- Ooh.

239
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:47,601
- ...while he does his, like, sexy gay dance...
- Oh!

240
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,270
...or whatever the hell he's
been working on this whole time.

241
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,471
- Yeah.
- So, the only thing that's missing...

242
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,206
- Yeah?
- ...is Mac!

243
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,275
Yeah. Uh, uh...

244
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:56,611
Yeah, good, good.
No problem, I got that covered.

245
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,212
- I got it.
- I hope so, dude,

246
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,414
'cause you only had one job to do, man.

247
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,547
I got it, I got it.

248
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,368
Go, go. Don't mess around the bar. Go!

249
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,482
Sure. What? Ugh!

250
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,177
Who the hell are you?

251
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,179
Who the hell are<i> you?</i>

252
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,115
Oh!

253
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,200
Ah, no!

254
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,335
- Mac!
- What do you want, Frank?

255
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,270
You were banging that broad,
weren't you?

256
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,539
You're-you're trying
to get a girl pregnant

257
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,276
just because that's what
your father wants you to do!

258
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:31,479
- Ah! Ah! Ah.
- No, no. Frank, that's not what it is, man.

259
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,214
You don't understand.

260
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,366
You're going back in the closet,
aren't you?

261
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,569
I can't stand it.
<i>Nobody</i> can stand it. Ah.

262
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,487
I'm not going back in the closet,
all right?

263
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,506
I-I just need to come out to him my way,

264
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,508
and I'm not ready
to do that yet, all right?

265
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,244
Ah! Ah! I don't care!

266
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,181
You're coming with me,
you're going on that float.

267
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,266
No! Frank, I'm not ready.

268
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,269
I don't want to do it,
and you can't make me.

269
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,404
Fine! Fine. Okay.

270
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,606
Stay here and bang your broads

271
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,451
and feel sorry for yourself.
You know, I don't care.

272
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,740
I don't need you. I'll get another gay.

273
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,480
Somebody way hotter than you.

274
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,233
Hey-oh!

275
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,073
Allow me to introduce Paddy's top gay,

276
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,887
a man everybody
in the neighborhood knows,

277
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,357
everybody loves.

278
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,190
The gay that will rope in all the gays.

279
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:22,380
- Cricket!
- What?

280
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,399
- Hey! Huh?
- Oh! Ah, ha, ha, ha.

281
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,606
Oh! Yeah.

282
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,141
- Huh?
- Yeah.

283
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,408
What the hell, Frank? Where's Mac?

284
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,210
- Mac's out.
- Why?!

285
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,412
- Well, I think he's going back in the closet.
- Goddamn it.

286
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,081
You had one job: get the gay man
to dance on the gay float.

287
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,232
- I know. No, he's, he...
- It's not that hard.

288
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,434
We got a problem. We got a problem.
Dennis doesn't want to drive.

289
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,169
Now he's saying he's
claustrophobic under there.

290
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,303
What is Cricket doing here?

291
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,505
- Because Frank blew it!
- Aw, come on, man.

292
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,440
- You had one job to do.
- That's what I said.

293
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,375
Cricket's gonna do the dance.
Dance, Cricket. Go. Dance.

294
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,578
No. No, no, no. He look... Oh, God.
No! Come on, man.

295
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,380
- No.
- He looks like a monster, and<i> you</i> look like a monster.

296
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,533
We're not trying to invite
a bar full of monster men.

297
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,535
We're-we're looking for
high-spending gay men.

298
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,203
Yeah, but get Dennis to dance.

299
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:03,337
You can't get the straight man to dance.

300
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:04,538
The press would murder us.

301
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,340
The press doesn't give
two shits about us.

302
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,276
Frank, it's 2018,
and you're the only person

303
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,144
who doesn't seem
to understand gay culture.

304
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,412
That's true. That's true.

305
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,480
My head is swelling with blood.

306
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,299
Goddamn it, Charlie.
We got to be there in 20 minutes.

307
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,300
All right. You know what?

308
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,224
Um, Cricket, fine.
You can dance. Let's go.

309
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,303
- Yo.
- Frank, can you at least

310
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,304
- drive the thing? Let's go.
- Yeah. All right.

311
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,106
- Yes.
- You're driving. You'll squeeze in there.

312
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,375
- You drive.
- Come on, man. - Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

313
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,512
Lady, I'm not going anywhere
until I see an Abraham Lincoln.

314
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:31,265
- Here you go.
- What is this? What is this?

315
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,202
- Like, 73 cents.
- No. I-I said Abraham Lincoln.

316
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,204
- There's a bunch of Lincolns in there.
- Oh, those are pennies!

317
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,605
- Okay. You want to give it back to me?
- Well, no. Hold on.

318
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,306
- Okay, you're gonna do it?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

319
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,275
- Yes, of course I'll do it.
- Then go do it. Go!

320
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,411
All right, now wait a second.

321
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,612
How do you turn it on? First the lights.

322
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,414
What is that?

323
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,282
Oh, that must be...

324
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,301
Okay, let's see what we got here.

325
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,237
Okay, uh, "Start north on Second Street.

326
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:57,241
Turn right on... Dickens Avenue."

327
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,642
Straight to... What the...?

328
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,440
Oh. Oh, shit. I...

329
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,399
Oh, God. Oh, this is ridiculous.

330
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,601
Oh, shit, I can't do this.

331
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:11,072
You know what? Screw this.

332
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:12,940
No good.

333
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,209
<i>Mac?</i>

334
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,307
Mac?

335
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,949
Mac, come here. Let me in. Let me in.

336
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,481
I'm gonna break the door down!

337
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,436
One. Two. Three.

338
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,237
Whoa. Ah, sh...

339
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,440
Ah, shit!

340
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,310
Jesus, Frank, that's a lot of blood.
Is that from just now?

341
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,313
Oh, no. No, that's from earlier.

342
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,399
You-you see, Mac,
I've been in agony the whole day,

343
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,534
but I came to this realization

344
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,337
that sometimes you got to let
the blood flow

345
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,272
in order to start the healing.

346
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,608
Some cuts you just can't plug up.

347
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:51,212
That's the same for you.
You got this thing inside you,

348
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:53,413
and you're trying to plug it up.

349
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,499
But you got to let that shit out.

350
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,301
You got to let it flow.

351
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,171
Otherwise, you're gonna be in
agony for the rest of your life.

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,639
So you're saying that
if I dance on the float,

353
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,375
that maybe I'll find my pride?

354
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,245
No. No, forget the float.

355
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,380
That's just doing it
for the wrong reasons.

356
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,533
You got to do something else.

357
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:23,411
I got you a couple things from the float
that you can use. I paid off the warden.

358
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:26,003
They think they're seeing
a Blake Shelton concert,

359
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:27,415
and I put your dad in the front row.

360
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:29,099
All right, I just...

361
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,102
I just don't know
if I can do this, Frank.

362
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,304
Mac, I don't get it,
and I may never get it,

363
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,189
but I do know you got to do this.

364
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,177
You said you want
to tell your dad your way.

365
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,446
So now do it.

366
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,168
Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,404
Hello, gentlemen.

368
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,273
Dudes.

369
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,141
Unfortunately...

370
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,211
Blake Shelton
will not be making it today.

371
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:00,281
But, uh, he did send me in his stead,

372
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,234
and I've got something special
to show you.

373
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,437
Uh, my name is Ronald McDonald, and...

374
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:10,040
I named him that.

375
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,944
I got something
that I got to tell you, Dad,

376
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,180
and I've been trying to find
the best way to do it, and...

377
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,332
I just thought instead of saying it,

378
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,270
maybe I could just show
you how I feel inside.

379
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,074
Dad...

380
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,076
I'm gay.

381
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,942
It's okay.

382
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,343
It's okay.

383
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,346
It's okay.

384
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,346
Oh, my God.

385
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,035
I get it.

386
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:10,274
I get it.

387
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,721
