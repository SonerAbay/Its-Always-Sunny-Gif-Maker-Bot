1
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:07,526
Hey, come on bro. Swim time.
It's a heat wave! Heat wave!

2
00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:09,581
Sorry about that, can I help you?

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,561
Dude, checking in for the pool.
Check us in.

4
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:14,433
Sorry sir, you can't bring
beer under the premises.

5
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:16,417
What?
You can't drink in this pool?

6
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,099
That's kind of weird.

7
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:21,238
Charlie, chop this, we'll just have
to finish these out here.

8
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:24,686
Why don't you help us out ?
No, I'm good.

9
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:27,273
More for us. You sure ?
I'm sure, yeah.

10
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,334
You know, I'm going to assume
you guys aren't members here.

11
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:31,436
You know what, why don't you
just go ahead and sign us up.

12
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:32,704
We'll blaze through these in no time.

13
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:33,338
Yeah.

14
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:35,273
Actually, if you'd like to join
our swim club, you need to

15
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,342
be sponsored by two existing members.

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,346
But I'm sorry to tell you, fellas, that
membership is currently at capacity.

17
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:44,483
At capacity?

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,417
Yeah.

19
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:48,553
We're in the middle of a terrible heat
wave and you happen to be at capacity--

20
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:49,788
for us.

21
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:51,690
Well, you can try the public
pool, but I should...

22
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:53,125
(belching):  Well, thank you.

23
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:54,659
Thank you for your suggestion.

24
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:55,694
We're out of here.

25
00:00:55,762 --> 00:00:56,294
Yeah.

26
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:56,895
Let's go.

27
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:57,763
(bleep) you.

28
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,432
You don't have to...
Oh, sir!

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,000
I cannot believe that
that just happened.

30
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:02,768
In this day and age, dude.

31
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,436
I know, I can't believe
there's such a big list.

32
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:06,805
Uh-uh.
Don't you get it, dude?

33
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:08,306
They'll always be "at capacity"

34
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:10,242
for us.

35
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:11,476
I don't get that at all.

36
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:12,444
Is that what he said?

37
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:13,378
Don't you get it?

38
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:14,446
We got big-timed, dude.

39
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:15,981
He called us lower-class.

40
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:16,982
He called us lower-class?

41
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,816
Yeah.

42
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:19,618
Yeah, but I wouldn't
argue with that, dude.

43
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:20,385
We're definitely lower-class.

44
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:22,087
Yeah, I'm not disputing
that fact, dude.

45
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,056
I'm saying we shouldn't
get boxed out for it.

46
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:24,823
It's bullshit.

47
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,858
Honestly, I just want to go swimming.
(belches)

48
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:28,560
Should we suck it up and
go to the public pool?

49
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:29,528
Ugh, gross, dude.

50
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:32,164
I will not go to that
disgusting public pool.

51
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:34,070
People there are gross.

52
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,466
I got a good idea.
Let's get out of here.

53
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:43,384
There she is, this is what
I'm talking about bro.

54
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:47,520
Man, the old diving pool, remember
how much fun we used to have here?

55
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,320
You know it's all Deep End.

56
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,499
Hell yeah we had fun dude,
you know why?

57
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,476
Because this was a pool for people
like us, street guys !

58
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,597
And I think it's clear
why it looks like shit now.

59
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,924
Well yeah,
cause Jamie Nelson drown in it.

60
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,420
What ? No.

61
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,254
I was gonna say it was because
of a pattern of discrimination.

62
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,148
Because this is a pool
for lower class people.

63
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:08,074
What ?
Yeah, look dude.

64
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,399
I say it's time we take matters
into our own hands with this.

65
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:12,681
What you thinking ?

66
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:14,848
I'm saying we're fixing up
this pool.

68
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,519
Man, I'm going to have to
keep tinkering with the A.C.

69
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,889
'cause I can't feel it at all.

70
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:57,857
Can you feel it?

71
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,658
Look, Charlie, you got to focus, okay?

72
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,060
A pool is a major investment.

73
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:03,395
So if we're going to get Frank
on board with this, we have to

74
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:05,464
approach him as equals.

75
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:06,232
Okay.

76
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,733
Now is that why you
got that gold chain?

77
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,034
That's why I got the gold chain.

78
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:09,568
All right, okay.

79
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,103
I see what you're going after here.

80
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,137
Hey, Frank?

81
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:12,938
FRANK: Yeah?

82
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,707
Hey, we have a little bit
of a presentation for you.

83
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:18,177
Can you come down?

84
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,545
What's up?

85
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:20,779
What's with the sheet?

86
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:21,881
Not just yet, okay?

87
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,616
Please, have a seat.

88
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:26,118
Charlie, get Frank a beer.

89
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,353
(Charlie imitating airplane)

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,387
Don't do airplane noises.

91
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:29,221
Just give him the beer.

92
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,122
Good move.

93
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,357
DEE: Why don't we get beers?

94
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,057
DENNIS: Yeah.

95
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,859
Because you're not even
supposed to be here, okay?

96
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:34,827
Frank is the audience.

97
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:35,861
So just keep your mouths shut.

98
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:36,896
Sheet, sheet, sheet.

99
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,098
Okay, ready.
Hey-ho here we go!

100
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,833
Boom!

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,434
Pool!

102
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,169
Charlie and I found this
abandoned pool that we used to

103
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:45,104
swim in when we were kids.

104
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,739
It's, like, full of, like, all
sorts of branches and shit...

105
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:47,673
It's a mess, it's a big mess.

106
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:51,143
If we have a little bit of money, we can
clean it up, and then we can... Pass.

107
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:51,844
Well, just let me finish.

108
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:53,512
I have a whole thing of...
Pass.

109
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,613
It's too much work.

110
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,681
What else you got?

111
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:58,584
So you guys are still all pissed off
about not getting into that swim club?

112
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,920
Look, if you guys were there,
you would know how we feel.

113
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:01,687
Oh, no, no, no.

114
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,521
Stop yourself right there.

115
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,356
See, we would not know how it
feels 'cause Dee and I would

116
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,091
have waltzed right
into that swim club.

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,993
Yeah, you don't lump
Dennis and me in with you.

118
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,629
We're-- we're high-class, so...
You should have seen this guy.

119
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:12,031
He would have lumped
the shit out of you.

120
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,732
Dennis, we live in the same apartment.

121
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,335
Let me explain to you guys a little
something about how class works.

122
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,169
You're born into class.

123
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:18,504
It's about pedigree,
it's about upbringing.

124
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,539
It has nothing to do with
your present circumstances.

125
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,608
No. See, Dennis and I were born
upper-class, and therefore

126
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,977
we currently are, and will
forever remain upper-class.

127
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:27,021
Frank, stop picking your teeth
for one second.

128
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,570
And back us up on this.

129
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,280
Look, I quit on that shit.

130
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,216
You understand?

131
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:32,284
I quit on it.

132
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:34,453
I don't give a rat's ass about class.

133
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,088
I live on the fringe.

134
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:37,389
Fringe class is where I am.

135
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:38,857
Okay, great, you're
in the fringe class.

136
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,026
I still maintain that Dee and
I are in the upper class.

137
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,429
But, you know, all this talk has really
gotten me thinking about taking a dip.

138
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:44,096
I'm hot as shit, Dee.

139
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:44,830
Oh, yeah.

140
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,165
We could go pop a hydrant.

141
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,333
We'd beat the heat that way.

142
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,334
I'm not popping shit.

143
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,869
That's about as low-class
as it gets-- Dee?

144
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:51,303
Swim club.

145
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:51,770
Swim club.

146
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:52,271
Later, bitches.

147
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,272
Okay.

148
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,079
Sorry, sir, we are at capacity.

149
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:01,681
Capacity?

150
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:04,817
That is unbelievable that you would
use the word capacity with us.

151
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:08,821
We truly could not admit you, even if
you had the sponsors, which you don't.

152
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:09,689
Okay, well, we know you.

153
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:10,790
You could sponsor us.

154
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:12,925
Yeah, I don't know what kind
of idea you have about us, but

155
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,026
we, sir, are like you.

156
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:17,430
Uh, send a little something
sweet his way maybe.

157
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:18,865
Oh, a little sweetness, huh?

158
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,766
Want a little something sweet?

159
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,201
All right, if that's the only
language he understands...

160
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:25,037
Sir, please, you're just
embarrassing yourself now.

161
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,106
Oh, I'm embarrassing?

162
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:29,342
I'm embarrassing myself?

163
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,111
Said the elitist pool guy.

164
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:34,313
You know, what, Dee, I don't
even think I'd want to be a part

165
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:39,051
of some exclusionary pool club, propagated
by this man-- this hate monger.

166
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,186
Oh, yeah, I'm with you.

167
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:42,522
I bet you don't even have
any black people here.

168
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:46,325
Excuse me, ma'am, but there is an
African-American family right there.

169
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:47,426
Oh, well, good for you.

170
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,462
You keep a couple of token
ones around, do you?

171
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,330
Parade 'em around
like dancing monkeys?

172
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,332
Right... Oh, no... That's not...
I didn't mean it like that.

173
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,833
Monkeys?

174
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,301
It's a phrase that means...
It's a phrase.

175
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:56,135
...performing on command.

176
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:59,472
Listen, listen, you are more than
happy to try the public pool.

177
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,306
Oh, can we?

178
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,440
Well, maybe we will.

179
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,409
Yeah.
Yeah, because we have class.

180
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:06,412
And having class means being able to
mix with people that are beneath you.

181
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,146
Mm-hmm.

182
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:08,181
Come on.

183
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,949
Your shirt doesn't
even fit, by the way.

184
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,485
If you want to be an elitist,
get yourself a tailor.

185
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:13,920
Oh!

186
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,588
Oh, Dee, that's...
Yeah.

187
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:16,289
Severely lacking in class.

188
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:17,223
Too much? My bad.

189
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,225
Got carried away.

190
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,430
Oh, Jesus Christ.

191
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:25,765
This is like a goddamn zoo.

192
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,834
Uh, there's a very disturbing
lack of adults here.

193
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:31,504
That girl just jumped in
with her sneakers on.

194
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,639
These people all have sneakers on.

195
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:35,541
All right, you know
what's happening here?

196
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:37,910
We're just experiencing a
little bit of culture shock.

197
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,813
These people are very different
from the people that are at our

198
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,424
normal pool environment, and this
whole environment is very difficult.

199
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,100
And that's ok, it's not a bad thing.

200
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,956
Dennis, Deandra!
What are you doing here?

201
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:51,757
I tried to pop a hydrant, but there
was no lookout, so I got shut down.

202
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:52,792
I see that you have a towel.

203
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:53,826
Where did you get that?

204
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,494
I don't see any
attendants around here.

205
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:58,831
Oh, I, uh, I bartered fringe
style with that guy over there.

206
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,401
I gave him a bite of my hot dog,
he's letting me use his towel.

207
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,070
Want a bite?

208
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,072
No.

209
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,501
Yo, Mac.

210
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:12,211
Yeah?

211
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,214
Hey, dude, I think this right
here has got "keeper pile"

212
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:16,282
written all over it.

213
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,818
We could probably set some of
this up strategically to kinda

214
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,053
represent where all the cool
shit in the pool's gonna be.

215
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,155
Like, you know, this rusty bike frame?

216
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,625
We could be, like, "That's
where the swim-up bar is."

217
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:26,359
Swim-up bar!

218
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:27,026
Yeah.

219
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:27,660
That's good, dude.

220
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,463
Yeah, I got a whole plan,
like, we'll dip one of those

221
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,733
cans with the string on it
into the water, and when we're

222
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,635
underwater, we'll place
our order, you know?

223
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:36,335
Two beers, please.

224
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:39,805
And when we swim up to the top,
Dennis hands them to us.

225
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:43,576
Eh, well, I was sort of
thinking we'd be at capacity

226
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:46,012
for Dennis, but I guess if he's
serving us, then that makes him

227
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,079
lower than us, so that's cool.

228
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah, he'll be lower than us.

229
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:48,848
Don't worry about that.

230
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,916
I don't want to put a tin can
in the water, though, with a

231
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,318
string, you know, because
we're not eight.

232
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:55,488
I just thought it'd be cool to put it
in your ear, you put it in your mouth.

233
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,157
Yeah, I mean, that's not cool, but...
Well, it's classy.

234
00:07:58,225 --> 00:07:59,325
Yeah, neither.

235
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:02,194
All right, well, you want to pop down
here and help me chuck this mattress out?

236
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:03,195
Yeah.

237
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,664
It's kind of like the
last big thing I got.

238
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,399
Yeah, we'll get all
of this out of here.

239
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,167
Ooh, God, dude, it's really squishy.

240
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,971
Yeah, it's covered in chlorine water,
but it's, you know, it's clean.

241
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,140
Yeah, you know there hasn't
been chlorine in here since

242
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:17,276
Jamie Nelson, but it's probably like raw
sewage that's been sitting in here.

243
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,345
U uh... uh, yeah, it's
got a sewagey smell.

244
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,079
Yeah. All right.

245
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:21,113
Let's just chuck it out.

246
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:21,947
Ready?

247
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,482
Yeah, let's get it out of here.

248
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,784
All right, give it a boost.

249
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,951
You ready?

250
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,019
BOTH: One, two, three.

251
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,622
BOTH: Yay!

252
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,257
Whoo! I'm strong, dude.

253
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,059
I'm definitely the one who's stronger.

254
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,060
Whoo!

255
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,361
Wow, dude, this pool is sweet, man.

256
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:35,995
It's super deep.

257
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:37,229
Yeah, I know, I know.

258
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:42,435
Yeah. Hey, dude, um, how have you
been getting in and out of here?

259
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:44,203
I was climbing up the mattress.

260
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:47,373
Sort of like a ladder-type situation.

261
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,141
Oh, shit!

262
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:53,212
Well...
Are we stuck in here?

263
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,613
I think we're stuck.

264
00:08:54,881 --> 00:09:00,688
Help! Help!

265
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:03,489
Come on!

266
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:04,390
Come on, man!

267
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,193
I can't eve make out an angle
to do a lap or anything.

268
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,327
Ow! Son of a bitch!

269
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:08,794
What? What?

270
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,363
I just stepped on broken glass!

271
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,700
Ow! Oh, my God, there's shards of broken
glass all over the bottom of the pool.

272
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,635
Well, now I know why
people are wearing shoes.

273
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:18,871
Yeah, now the shoes
make a lot of sense.

274
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:22,408
Okay, Frank, what in the hell are you
doing with that watermelon, man?

275
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:23,442
You ever play this game?

276
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,245
You grease the watermelon up,
you throw it in the pool,

277
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,247
everybody goes crazy
trying to grab it!

278
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:29,115
They can't grab it!

279
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,183
Greased watermelon!

280
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,252
Here it comes! Try to grab it!

281
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Oh, no!

282
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,623
Come on.

283
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:40,393
Come on!

284
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,462
Ugh, I can't believe you
borrowed hot dog guy's towel.

285
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,964
Yeah, well, I'm not proud of it.

286
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:45,331
Gross.

287
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,499
Listen, I have a proposition.

288
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,235
Yeah, I have a proposition, too : let me
walk in front of you so you don't get

289
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:50,202
your blood all over my feet.

290
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,736
That's fair.

291
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:52,371
Hey, why don't we
call Mac and Charlie?

292
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:54,340
I just feel like their pool has
gotta be better than this.

293
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:57,276
No, we don't want them to know that we
didn't get into the private swim club.

294
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:58,277
Oh, son of a bitch!

295
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,345
What?

296
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,580
Which one of you little
shits stole my shoes?!

297
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,082
Goddamn it!

298
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,184
I'm putting out a feeler call.

299
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:08,487
Stride, stride, stride,
stride, execute!

300
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:11,590
Ah! Ah! Okay, I think I see
what the problem is, though.

301
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,392
This move is intended for a back flip.

302
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,483
And what I need to do is a front flip.

303
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:18,047
Now if you needed a back flip,
I'd be up that wall in a second.

304
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,385
No, you just wouldn't, because
you don't know how to do a back flip.

305
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,984
Charlie, I do back flips
every single day of my life.

306
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:27,817
No you don't, I have never seen...
Do a back flip right now please

307
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,171
Can I see one? Let's see one.

308
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:34,144
I need to stay focused, and conserve energy.

309
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:37,622
(Charlie imitating Mac)

310
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,616
What if I need to do
a back flip later?

311
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,644
You need to do some kind
of flip now and you don't know how.

312
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,765
Cause you don't know how
to flip, or do karate.

313
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:47,673
All you know what to do is talk me into
doing shit, where I get stuck in a pool.

314
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:51,029
Where I'm definitely gonna die.
Oh wait, my phone's ringing.

315
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,322
You've had a cellphone this entire time?
Are you kidding me?

316
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,682
Hello ? Charlie, hey Dennis and I...

317
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,455
No, leave my name out of it.

318
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,918
It's Dee and Dennis dude, they'll rescue us.

319
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,897
No, do not tell them that
we're stuck in here.

320
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,270
Because getting stuck in an abandonned
pool is extremely low class.

321
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,948
Dennis will sink his teeth into it.

322
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,370
Ooh, I feel like if I talk to him,
it's gonna kind of slip out.

323
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,885
Just don't let it slip out.

324
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,363
But I kind of want to tell him.

325
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,725
Oh my God! Just give me the phone.

326
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:22,492
It's Mac. How is it going over there in
your deserted mine shaft or whatever?

327
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,363
Oh, it's pretty sweet here, okay?

328
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,197
It's very private.

329
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:28,000
Probably way more private
than your piece of shit pool.

330
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,435
Really? (chuckles)

331
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:30,636
I doubt that, you know.

332
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,438
Is that Mexican music?

333
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:33,672
Uh, the music.

334
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,342
Uh, you know, it's, it's...
You know what it is?

335
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:37,409
It's one of the attendants.

336
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:41,514
He's walking around with a ghetto blaster
serving us drinks and just making us

337
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,649
comfortable, giving us hats.

338
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:47,353
Why does it sound so
echoey over there?

339
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,955
Nothing but relaxation going
on over here, you know?

340
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:50,589
It's very relaxey.

341
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:51,824
We're stuck in the pool!

342
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:54,527
And that's probably what you're
hearing is the, is the relaxation.

343
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,662
Hey! Hey, those are my shoes!

344
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,630
What?

345
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:00,432
Uh, the attendant, you know,
he just walked off with my

346
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,935
shoes, and ooh, it made me
mad because he didn't ask.

347
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:07,640
But, but... But, but it's great
because, in the end, I'm gonna end up

348
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:08,641
with polished shoes.

349
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,543
You know how it goes.

350
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,812
Okay, bye.

351
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,047
Damn it, dude!

352
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,615
That private pool's awesome!

353
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:17,349
They have attendants!

354
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,250
Oh, my God!

355
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:18,884
Who's in attendance?

356
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:19,518
How many people?

357
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:22,521
No, she didn't say anything...
No, people that wait on them hand and foot.

358
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:23,289
Oh, my God, really?

359
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,657
Yes. Oh, my God, all right.

360
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,692
Dude, since when do you
have a cell phone?

361
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,727
I buy 'em all the time now, you know?

362
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,764
You prepay for it, and then you
buy it and you throw it away.

363
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,965
There's a name for it.

364
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:33,432
A burner?

365
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,533
A burner! That's a burner.

366
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,168
Dude, this is what drug dealers buy.

367
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:36,769
Oh, really?

368
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:40,005
This is a very specific
sect of lower class, okay?

369
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,107
This is like, this is,
like, felon class.

370
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,175
Felon class, huh?

371
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:45,210
God! All right, okay,
so, let me see.

372
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,412
Who are we gonna call?

373
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,647
We can't call the police, right, because...
No, we're trespassing.

374
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:49,982
Yeah. Oh, I got an idea!

375
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,250
Let's order some food!

376
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:53,052
Oh-oh, yeah!

377
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,187
Then we have the delivery guy
come, and he can help us out.

378
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,323
Perfect. And we can get some
Chinese food 'cause that's the

379
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,291
classiest poolside food you can have.

380
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,827
Yeah, we probably shouldn't
get Chinese, though, because

381
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,996
those delivery guys are
always Chinese, and he won't

382
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:07,232
understand a word we're saying and plus,
he's probably gonna be too short.

383
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,168
Ooh...
Yeah.

384
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,036
I could really go for some
Chinese food, though, man.

385
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:11,637
That'd be good.

386
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:15,174
But we're not actually eating the food, so...
I'm gonna eat the food, for sure.

387
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:15,708
I'm starving.

388
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:16,775
Okay, you know what, dude?

389
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:17,977
Let me handle it, all right?

390
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,645
I'm gonna call...
I'm gonna call pizza delivery.

391
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,146
Pizza, we're gonna get some pizza.

392
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,582
It'll be some big Italian lug
and he'll fish us out of here.

393
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,183
Fish sounds good.

394
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,417
Yeah, see if they have fish there.

395
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,419
I'll ask.

396
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,542
This place is a shithole.

397
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,711
I motion for Mac and Charlie's pool.

398
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,080
It just didn't sound like
it was that bad over there.

399
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,149
Look, there's absolutely no
way in hell I'm letting Mac

400
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,551
and Charlie know that we didn't
get into that swim club.

401
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:43,853
(clattering)

402
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,520
Ow!

403
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:45,221
What?

404
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:46,255
Ow! What the hell?!

405
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:46,889
What? What happened?

406
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:47,690
What was that?!

407
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:48,023
What?

408
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:49,225
That's a rock, Dennis.

409
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,694
These kid are throwing rocks
at each other for fun.

410
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,630
I mean, what kind of savages throw
rocks at each other to have fun times?

411
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:55,197
You know what?

412
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,165
I am done with this place.

413
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:56,866
I'm done with it.

414
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,567
We need to take another
run at that swim club.

415
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:01,036
Yeah, well, we better before I
lose it and I drown a child!

416
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:01,804
Here. Here you go.

417
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,240
We ate the watermelon.

418
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:05,174
(chuckles) Butter me up.

419
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,142
I'm gonna be the watermelon
and jump in the pool.

420
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,577
Do my back; I can't do my back.

421
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:09,011
Go ahead.

422
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,379
Ugh!

423
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,014
(grunting and laughing)

424
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,450
Get ready for a rock in the eye, bro.

425
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:15,451
Ahh!

426
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:16,452
(both laugh)

427
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,453
(groans): Oh!

428
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,454
Oh, no!

429
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:19,455
Ow! That one really hurt.

430
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:20,456
That really hurt.

431
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:21,457
Truce, truce, truce, truce!

432
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:22,625
No more throwing rocks, right?

433
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:23,626
Hello?

434
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:24,627
Oh?

435
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:25,628
Uh-oh.

436
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:26,629
Hello? Eh!

437
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:28,470
Hey!

438
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,679
You guys ordered a pizza?

439
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,865
You got to be kiding me
He's chinese

440
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,870
His English sounds pretty good, so...
and he's kind of big, too.

441
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:37,373
Hey, we're stuck in this pool,
dude-- can you help us out?

442
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,374
Is this a prank?

443
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:39,041
No, no, no.

444
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:41,043
Look, dude, dude, dude, look
We'll pay you first, all right?

445
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,045
And then just help us out of here.

446
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:43,979
Charlie, you got some cash?

447
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:44,546
Uh... no. Shit.

448
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:45,247
Check your front pockets.

449
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:45,981
What are you doing?

450
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:48,784
Well, no, I cut them off, 'cause they're
overshooting the bottom of my shorts.

451
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:49,852
Forget it, I'm out of here.

452
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,020
BOTH: No, no, no, no, no, wait!

453
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:52,388
Hey, we'll give you a gold chain.

454
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:53,155
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah.

455
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:53,856
Toss it up.

456
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:54,857
Okay.

457
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:55,858
Here you go. Okay.

458
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,160
Hey, toss that pizza down,
too, man; I'm starving.

459
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,161
Yeah, might as well.

460
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,529
I haven't eaten.

461
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,531
Oh, no, dude!

462
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,732
Sorry.

463
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,202
Hey, bro, why don't you just toss down
that hose, then you can pull us up.

464
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,203
See that hose right there?

465
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,204
That'd be good, yeah.

466
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:10,039
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:11,040
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:12,041
That's it.

469
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,976
All right.

470
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:14,977
Here you go.

471
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:15,978
Oh, that's perfect.

472
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:16,779
That's perfect.

473
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,948
Hey! Hey, this change
is fake as shit, man.

474
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:19,949
I'm sorry, dude.

475
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:20,950
He's white trash.

476
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:22,084
Don't take it personally.

477
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,185
Don't take it personally!

478
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:24,353
Forget it, I'm out of here.

479
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,487
(Mac and Charlie shouting)

480
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:26,055
Don't go!

481
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:27,056
All right, whatever.

482
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:27,923
No problem, no problem.

483
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,191
You can just climb it, right?

484
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,327
I'm just going to climb right up it.

485
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:33,896
Okay, stand back 'cause it
takes a real man to do this.

486
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:34,897
You ready, bro?

487
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:35,898
(Charlie and Mac yelling)

488
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:36,899
Oh, man!

489
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,765
Whoa!

490
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,769
Oh, dude!

491
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,105
All right, that's it.

492
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,106
I'm calling Dennis.

493
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,623
No, don't you understand?

494
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,447
This pool is our bootstraps
and it's lifting us up

495
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:50,163
Into the middle class, dude.

496
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,337
Just accept the fact
that you're white trash.

497
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,274
Take a look at yourself,
you can't do back flips.

498
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,141
You don't know karate, you're white trash !

499
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,703
You're white trash too, dude,
look at those shorts are white trash

500
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,181
Do not call those shorts white trash.

501
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,909
Dennis told me about these shorts
and they're not white trash.

502
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,714
Look at this. Look what I can do.

503
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,620
What is white trash about that ?

504
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,084
Don't call me white trash.

505
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:17,203
I feel if I had that kind of mobility,
I'd be capable of pretty much anything.

506
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:19,402
Yeah, maybe then you could get the flip.

507
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:21,413
Although I doubt it, I really doubt it.

508
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,477
Can we just call Dennis?
Fine call Dennis

509
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,754
Oh shit, dude !

510
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:28,828
I put the phone on my front pocket.

511
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:35,290
God...damn it!

512
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,662
How is this gonna work ?
we look bad.

513
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,520
We're getting in this pool
if it's the last thing we do, ok?

514
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,747
We just need 2 sponsors
and we'll get in, don't worry.

515
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:45,435
Really? You don't think we should
go home and take a shower first?

516
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,270
We don't have time to take a shower.
Here we go.

517
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:50,506
Hi, hi, family, little ones.

518
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:51,040
Hey!

519
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:52,041
Hi, Mom.

520
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,909
Hey, listen, sorry to jump out
in front of you like that, but

521
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:56,378
as you've noticed, there is a bit of a
heat wave going on in Philly right now.

522
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:58,447
Oh, it's a terrific heat wave,
and I'll tell you what,

523
00:16:58,515 --> 00:16:59,214
it's affecting everybody.

524
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,250
It really is, and we're looking
to cool down a little bit.

525
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,852
We thought this pool, that'd be a
great place for us to cool off.

526
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,853
Oh, yeah, and you know what?

527
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,855
We just need a couple of sponsors.

528
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,624
Hey, Dee, um, you're
bleeding a little bit.

529
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:09,491
Is it, is it bleeding?

530
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,259
Is it happening?

531
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,360
Kids, don't touch the blood.

532
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:14,163
Hey, guys, I got kicked
out of that other pool.

533
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,765
This Filipino lady went crazy on me.

534
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,435
She scratched me like a velociraptor.

535
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:20,869
Just like stings like, aah!

536
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:21,870
Excuse me.

537
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,038
What is happening here?

538
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:25,474
These people are bleeding
all over the place.

539
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,642
We're not bleeding all over the place.

540
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:27,376
All over the place?

541
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:30,079
Mrs. Baines, I am sorry if
they were harassing you.

542
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:31,547
Please have a wonderful day.

543
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:32,815
We'll see you very soon.

544
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:33,816
Listen, buddy.

545
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:34,917
You gotta let us in the pool.

546
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:35,918
It's so hot!

547
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:37,453
Try to understand.

548
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,588
We are at capacity.

549
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,990
We're not at capacity 'cause I
can see the pool from here...

550
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:44,593
We are at capacity, sir!

551
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,928
I'm jumping in the pool.

552
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:46,962
I'm jumping in the pool.

553
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,364
Yeah, plus I'm gonna
piss in it-- heh-heh!

554
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm jumping in the pool!

555
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:54,503
(crashing, clattering)

556
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,978
All right.

557
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:05,480
You see, Charlie, this
is a proper memorial.

558
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:08,183
I think Jamie Nelson would've
liked this, you know.

559
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:11,286
Yeah. I like, I like the skateboard
'cause Jamie loved skateboarding.

560
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:11,987
He did like skateboarding.

561
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,422
Not much of a swimmer.

562
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:14,423
Not a very good swimmer.

563
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,424
No. No, he wasn't.

564
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:17,826
Okay, well, I think we can both
agree that we need to make sure

565
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:19,928
that his spirit does not haunt us.

566
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:22,364
Yes, definitely want to ward off
his spirit, so, if you know any...

567
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,165
Okay. Shall we join hands?

568
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,534
...you know, voodoo or whatever, go ahead and...
Well, it's not called voodoo,

569
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:26,535
okay?

570
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,670
This is, this is, this
is the Lord Our Savior.

571
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:29,671
Okay, here we go.

572
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,376
"Lamb of God, who takes away..."

573
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:35,077
What is that?
Charlie let me do my thing.

574
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,244
I'll just let you do
your thing-- all right.

575
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:41,249
Lamb of God, who taketh away the souls
of the world...Don't take his soul...

576
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:45,721
and get his soul out...
You don't have to provide any kind of...

577
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,122
Let me just do my thing.

578
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,257
I just want to be sure we get
that spirit out of here.

579
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:51,126
♪ Lamb of God who takes
away the sins of... ♪

580
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:54,062
Alligator tooth and snakeskin...
Don't undermine my prayer with voodoo.

581
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,930
Okay. Prayer.

582
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:55,664
Don't do it.

583
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,599
I won't do it.

584
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,601
♪ Lamb of God who takes... ♪

585
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,439
Alligator tooth and snakeskin spirit,
take this spirit out of this pool.

586
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,441
You know what, if you're not
going to take this seriously...

587
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,643
I'm taking it perfectly seriously.

588
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,644
What the hell is this?

589
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:09,645
Aah, oh, God... Nice!

590
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,980
Wow, this place is a shit hole, huh?

591
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:14,983
Yeah, I don't know why I thought it
would look any different, honestly.

592
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:15,984
Get yo' spirit out of here!

593
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:16,985
Hey, guys, whoa.

594
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:17,986
Hey! (chuckling)

595
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,488
What the hell are you
doing down there?

596
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:19,988
Nothing.

597
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:20,989
We're just hanging out.

598
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,225
No, we got stuck in this-- Shut up!
Shut up!

599
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,227
Nah, nah, we're good,
we're good, we're good.

600
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,228
We're just chillin'.

601
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,229
Yeah, this is pathetic.

602
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,231
The word trashy just...
doesn't even do it justice.

603
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,098
(Dee laughs)

604
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,100
Whatever.
What've you guys been doing here?

605
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,102
Why don't you go back to your fancy pool.
We're fine.

606
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,071
Fancy pool got old after a while.

607
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:37,072
Wait a second.

608
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,908
You guys didn't get
into the pool, did you?

609
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,009
DEE & DENNIS: What?!

610
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:43,278
Oh, my God, you sons of bitches!

611
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:44,279
You didn't get in.

612
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:45,947
Admit that you were low
class just like us.

613
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,483
I'm not admitting shit because
I did get into that pool.

614
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,785
I just got tired of swimming in it.

615
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:50,986
All right, then why are you here?

616
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,287
Why are you piping in trash?

617
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:53,588
You shut your mouth, trash.

618
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:54,790
Why are you calling me trash?

619
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,692
I defended you earlier
'cause of these shorts.

620
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,226
You are the ones that are trash!

621
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:00,896
Sitting in the bottom of a pool
that's filled with trash, like trash.

622
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:01,763
You guys are white trash!

623
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,764
You admit it right now!

624
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,468
Oh! I hope you trash bags die at the
bottom of this pool like Jamie Nelson did.

625
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,637
Don't bring Jamie Nelson into this!

626
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:09,705
All right, forget about it!

627
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:10,405
Stop it!

628
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:11,406
Just stop it!

629
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:17,345
I think I have a way for us to beat
the heat tonight, Philly style.

630
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,380
(fire hydrant squeaking)

631
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,614
Yeah!

632
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:20,816
Oh, yes!

633
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:21,817
(Frank drops wrench)

634
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:22,818
(laughing)

635
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:23,819
