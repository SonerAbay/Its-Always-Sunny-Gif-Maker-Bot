1
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,969
<i>What an awesome night it's been, huh?</i>

2
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,971
<i>- Yeah.
- Good night, what a night.</i>

3
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,974
You know, you know,
when I first started working at Paddy's,

4
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:29,511
this place was way more
likely to host a dog fight

5
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,133
than an event like tonight.

6
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:35,067
In fact, when I first walked in,
there<i> were</i> two dogs fighting.

7
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,468
- Sure.
- They were, like, strays or something

8
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,470
that had wandered in? No one noticed.

9
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,872
- I don't know.
- Anyway, the point is,

10
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,207
that this place has changed.

11
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,409
You know? It's really evolved.

12
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:47,212
And it's been so welcoming
of this brown-skinned girl

13
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,947
and her liberal ideals.

14
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,365
They're like family now.

15
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,967
Which is saying a lot,

16
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,769
since the first time I met Frank,
he pulled a gun on me.

17
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,238
Misunderstanding. Not racial.

18
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,908
Thanks, Frank. Anyway, the point is,
Paddy's is now a place

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,711
where progressive-minded people
like us can feel at home.

20
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:05,046
And I think that is worth
a round of applause.

21
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:06,148
Yeah.

22
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,469
Oh.

23
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,871
You think those liberal
morons bought it?

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,273
- Oh, yeah!
- They bought every word you said.

25
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,008
Oh, we've never been this successful.

26
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,677
This wine is selling like crazy.

27
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,678
And look,
it's called "Conservative Whine,"

28
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,996
but it's spelled with an "H,"

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,415
'cause it's like "We're whining."

30
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,567
It's a pun.
It's a play on the word "wine."

31
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:27,235
Yeah. Yeah, Mac, I get it.
I came up with it.

32
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,304
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah, so smart. Shut up, Mac.

33
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:30,705
- So smart.
- I get it, I get it.

34
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:32,708
We're squeezing those liberal
boners for all they got,

35
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,442
and we're just gonna
keep on squeezing them.

36
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,511
- Yeah.
- Uh, no, we're not.

37
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,980
- No, we're not.
- Dee, try to keep up, man.

38
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,314
- Okay?
- I'm sorry.

39
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,933
- Got to keep up.
- Look.

40
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,601
These liberals are easy.

41
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,137
It's the conservative
crowd we're going after.

42
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,347
- How?
- Nice. How? Whatcha thinking?

43
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:50,341
Oh, uh, a little thing like...

44
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,679
we're gonna make Paddy's great again.

45
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,648
_

46
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:22,508
All right.

47
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,413
- Hello, guys! Welcome!
- Hello.

48
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,148
Thank you for letting me host

49
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,700
- the planning evening.
- Uh-huh. What'd you make?

50
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,636
Yes, I made Mac's Famous Mac and Cheese

51
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:36,571
and some energy drinks for everybody.

52
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:38,039
It's all he ever makes
and it's un-edible.

53
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,174
Okay, whatever.

54
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,709
Let's get to the plan.

55
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,577
Uh, ooh, ooh.
Sorry, um, for interrupting.

56
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:45,447
I just wanted to do the unveiling first,
if that's cool.

57
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,065
- The unveiling of what?
- Okay, everybody,

58
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,667
are you ready?

59
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,803
Bam.

60
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,939
- All right, what's up?
- What's going on?

61
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,008
Oh, well,
I-I got into really good shape.

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,009
Am I hitting the light right?

63
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,678
Wh-What... what's happening?

64
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,146
- Why?
- Why?

65
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,798
I don't know,
I thought maybe we could use it.

66
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:04,900
Use it for what?

67
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:06,234
For the bar.

68
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,769
- How?
- How?

69
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,772
Well, Cindy, do you think maybe
we could fit this into the plan?

70
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,307
I don't think so.

71
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:14,176
I don't really know
what's going on here, though.

72
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,978
- Me, neither.
- Yeah, no one ever really knows what's going on with Mac.

73
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,781
- He's fat, he's skinny, he's muscular, it's...
- It's best to ignore it.

74
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,267
It's really a cry for
help and attention,

75
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,601
- I think, so...
- Yeah.

76
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,537
...what you do in that
situation is you ignore those.

77
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,472
Yeah, treat it like a baby.
Treat it like a toddler.

78
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,008
- We're not gonna... put it into the plan?
- That make sense?

79
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,210
- Yeah. Okay.
- Why did I... why did I do it?

80
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,479
- Nobody knows.
- We don't know.

81
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,281
- So, I have a great plan.
- Should I put my shirt on?

82
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,632
- But...
- I think that's best.

83
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:39,701
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, congrats,
Mac, it looks really good.

84
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,502
- Good job.
- Can we figure out a way

85
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,838
- to incorporate later?
- Let's just move past it now,

86
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,840
- 'cause it's dinnertime.
- Yeah?

87
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,308
You guys like me, right?

88
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,779
- So...
- Okay,

89
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:54,132
I have a plan how we are
gonna shut down Murphy's Pub.

90
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:56,504
What's that?

91
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,469
- What's Murphy's Pub? What is that?
- Wait, what is that?

92
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,206
Murphy's Pub?
It's around the corner from you guys.

93
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,540
- Oh, the bar, the bar.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,742
The super successful
bar around the corner.

95
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,543
- They do well.
- Why would we shut that down?

96
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,945
Because they do, like, five times

97
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,147
- the business that we do.
- They do?

98
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,100
Yeah, so we're gonna poach
their customers, shut them down,

99
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,902
thereby making Paddy's great again.

100
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,504
- Whoa! That is so smart.
- That is smart.

101
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,972
Why have we never
thought about doing that?

102
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,707
I don't know,
we're gonna steal their customers.

103
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,310
Ah, this is the waitress.
Do you guys mind if I get this?

104
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:23,511
Yeah, we're right in the middle...

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,579
Hey, honey.

106
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,647
Sorry, I'm in a meeting.

107
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:26,715
Are you just...

108
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:27,933
You're just checking in?

109
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,801
I don't know.
Is the TV just not working?

110
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:32,149
All right.

111
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,738
Can I call you later or something,
'cause I'm just...

112
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,407
We're super bu... we're in the thing.

113
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,742
Yeah, I'll check in later.

114
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,210
- Sorry, she was just checking in.
- Oh, cool.

115
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:39,944
Yeah. All right, so what's up?

116
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,748
- So, how are we gonna do this?
- I'm gonna take you through the plan.

117
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,433
There's a lot of moving pieces,
and you each play

118
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:45,834
- a crucial part.
- It's here! It's here!

119
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:47,946
Cindy, I am so sorry for interrupting,

120
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,640
but it has finally arrived,

121
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:51,372
and I think you are going
to be very impressed

122
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,642
with what is inside this crate.

123
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,644
- Another rocket launcher.
- No, Frank.

124
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,180
Much cooler than that.

125
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:01,466
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

126
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,468
What am I looking at here, Mac?

127
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,271
- What? What do you mean?
- Oh...

128
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,873
- Is that a sex doll?
- Yeah.

129
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,676
- Is that Dennis?
- Well, yeah, of course.

130
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,546
- Is that part of the plan?
- No!

131
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,432
Why did you get a sex doll
of your old roommate?

132
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,234
Because you told me to get one.

133
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,035
- I definitely did not.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,039
I was, I was super sad about
my old roommate leaving,

135
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,909
and you said I needed something
Dennis-shaped to fill my hole.

136
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,445
No, Mac, I said that you obviously had

137
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:33,648
a Dennis-shaped hole in your
life that you needed to fill.

138
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,867
How is that not the same thing?

139
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,669
Okay, I obviously wanted you to,
I don't know, maybe start dating

140
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:42,776
or do something,
not get a sex doll of your best friend.

141
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,142
- No, not best friend.
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

142
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,344
- Yeah, sorry, not best friend.
- He didn't like him much.

143
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,280
He left him a contact number
for where he was gonna be

144
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,565
in North Dakota, but it ended
up being a mental health line.

145
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,033
- Yeah.
- He miswrote

146
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:55,253
- one of the digits, and that...
- Nah, he knew what he was doing.

147
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,172
- He was avoiding him.
- No, it was not a mistake.

148
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,324
All right, well, look, guys,
either way, it's not weird.

149
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,443
It's not like I'm
gonna have sex with it.

150
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:04,579
He's gonna have sex with that
the second we walk out of this door.

151
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,447
No. It might just be cool to have around

152
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,666
for, like, companionship, you know?

153
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,601
- Nah, he wants to bang it.
- I'm not gonna bang it.

154
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,003
- This is the waitress again. Should I get it?
- Oh, my God, come on.

155
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,938
Okay, you know what,
you know what, this is just...

156
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,474
this is not gonna work here, all right?

157
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,808
Let's just go.

158
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,143
Please get rid of the doll.

159
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,011
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get rid of the doll.

160
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,613
It was a misunderstanding, you know?

161
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,281
Like, I'm not gonna have sex with it.

162
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,500
He is. The second we leave,
he's gonna bang it.

163
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:29,771
<i>Okay, guys, I am going to use</i>

164
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:32,123
social media to spread fake news

165
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,808
that Murphy's hired an
alt-right figurehead

166
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:35,677
to speak at their pub.

167
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,113
The liberals are gonna protest,
while the conservatives are

168
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,448
gonna march for the speaker's
First Amendment rights,

169
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,167
and that is where Frank comes in.

170
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,472
A tuba? What am I gonna do with a tuba?

171
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,074
You're gonna play it
to enflame the crowd.

172
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,543
Dee, we're gonna need to
distract Murphy's security guard

173
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,079
- with a pretty blonde.
- Okay.

174
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,547
You want me to go find one?

175
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,365
No. I'm talking about you.

176
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,300
Oh, you want me to flirt? Oh, wow.

177
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,369
Normally I'm on lookout
while Dennis flirts.

178
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,638
But okay, I'm in.

179
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,840
- Great. Next part of the plan. Now, listen up...
- Oh, hey, guys.

180
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:09,310
So, so sorry.
Cindy, I'm so sorry I'm late.

181
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,846
- Got held up, but I am ready.
- What is this?

182
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,733
Why did you bring that thing?
I told you to get rid of it!

183
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,803
Oh, I tried, but apparently,
I cannot return the doll

184
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,072
due to the custom nature
of the<i> usage</i> of the doll.

185
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,742
- Banging its mouth.
- Right.

186
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,678
I guess some people do.
I don't know, but I don't know.

187
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Either way, what do you guys think?

188
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,834
- About what?
- I'm shirtless in the duster.

189
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,302
Oh, yeah. Why?

190
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,571
- Well, I thought that could work.
- Toward what?

191
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:37,772
I don't know.

192
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,107
This is Cindy's plan.
Cindy, how does this work?

193
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,710
It doesn't. Stop trying to
shoehorn your shirtless-ness

194
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,645
into plans that have no need for it.

195
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,715
Well, I feel like this is
what Dennis would've done.

196
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,466
Yeah, but Dennis
had a reason for it, man!

197
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,268
And you're not Dennis!
You're never gonna be, all right?

198
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,869
- So just drop it.
- This, by the way,

199
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,671
- is desperate and sad.
- It's just sad, dude.

200
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,606
It was his idea anyway, so...

201
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,944
I'm sorry,
the sex doll gave you an idea?

202
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,013
Well, not exactly,
but you know, it was, like,

203
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,414
when I was sitting there with him,

204
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,367
I was sort of picturing
what Dennis would say.

205
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:10,172
- Oh.
- And that's...

206
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,306
- Nice one, man.
- What?

207
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:13,508
Oh, something the doll just said.

208
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:14,976
The doll talks to you now?

209
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,245
No, the doll's not talking to me,
but like he said,

210
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,188
I was picturing what Dennis
might've said in the situation

211
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,066
and Dennis just said
something really funny.

212
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,335
- What was it?
- Well, it was about you, Dee.

213
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,403
- I just heard it.
- Do you picture it?

214
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,205
I heard it. Oh, yeah.

215
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,819
- I heard it.
- It's...

216
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,908
What the hell are you
guys talking about?

217
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,610
- It called me a bird.
- Yes! It did.

218
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,678
- Exactly.
- So you did hear it.

219
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,613
- We all heard it.
- Bird.

220
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,080
How is that funny?

221
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,148
It's-it's really not.

222
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,034
It's just the way Dennis
would have said it.

223
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,703
You can just sort of picture
it coming out of his mouth.

224
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,839
Okay, okay, cool, but, guys,
can we just get back to the plan?

225
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,307
- Yes.
- Mac's shirtless plan, or...?

226
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:47,442
Mac's shirtless plan.

227
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,110
No, he did not have a plan.

228
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,246
Our plan. My plan.
To shut down Murphy's.

229
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,332
Dee, you're gonna flirt
with the security guard.

230
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,136
Frank, tuba. Mac, Charlie,

231
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:58,202
I need you to change
labels on wine bottles.

232
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,504
Okay? Any questions?

233
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,139
Yes?

234
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,208
The blowjob mouth,
did it come standard on the doll

235
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,876
or did you customize that?

236
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,745
It's not a blowjob mouth, Dee.
Don't be crass.

237
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,613
I requested that the doll feel as though

238
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,665
- it's in mid-conversation.
- Oh.

239
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,235
- Okay. Any other questions?
- Yup.

240
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,136
Not about the sex doll.

241
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,712
"Liberal Tears." It's so funny because

242
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,381
the liberals are always
whining about stuff

243
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,599
and the conservatives drink it up.

244
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,734
- They're drinking their tears.
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

245
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,268
No, Cindy's brilliant, man.

246
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,538
And using all the glitter and
stuff was a great idea, too,

247
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,807
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah, I had a good idea about the glitter.

248
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,342
I was thinking maybe
you would slather it

249
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,611
all over my naked torso
and we would use that.

250
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,629
Why?

251
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,832
Oh, well, that can just be a
part of the plan, you know?

252
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,434
It doesn't have anything to
do with anything, though.

253
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,569
Well, then why did I do all
this working out, Charlie?

254
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:48,970
Nobody knows, man.

255
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,239
- All right, guys. What do you think?
- Whoa!

256
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,308
- Wow, Dee, you look great!
- Really?

257
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:54,643
Yeah, I hate to admit it,

258
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,177
but this look's kind of working for you.

259
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,313
Yeah, you might actually be able
to distract that security guard.

260
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,313
Nice.

261
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,100
Whoa!

262
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,670
- Frank, you got it, man!
- Holy shit! Uh, look.

263
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,406
Dee looks good,
Frank's killing it on the tuba,

264
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,408
we might actually be able
to pull this thing off.

265
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,343
I think we're gonna do it. I think...

266
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,680
What happened?

267
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,947
I can't do it.

268
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,900
- Wh-Why?
- What went wrong?

269
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:20,902
He's staring right at me.

270
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:24,305
So what?

271
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,174
Look, I know it's just a lifeless thing

272
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:29,310
that Mac pumps his loads into,
but it's in my head.

273
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:32,047
Again, guys,
I am not having sex with the doll.

274
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:34,065
- You unload in that doll.
- You're having sex with the doll.

275
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,134
- You unload into that doll.
- I can smell it. Yeah.

276
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,735
No, th-that's bleach. I cleaned him.

277
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,871
- Well, then why did you clean it?
- Why did you clean it?

278
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,341
It doesn't matter why I cleaned it.
I-I'm a sanitary person.

279
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,678
Look, I got to be honest.
It's in my head, too.

280
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,747
- How?
- It doesn't like what I'm wearing

281
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,215
and it thinks I need more makeup.

282
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:55,236
- Oh...
- Oh, my God.

283
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,771
I can totally see that.

284
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,840
Yeah, I can picture Dennis
saying that to you right now.

285
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,775
Yeah, it also thinks Mac looks fat.

286
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,179
- That's... that's a lie!
- I know, I know, but it...

287
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,581
- that's just what he thinks.
- Let me ask it. Dennis, does Mac look fat?

288
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,601
- What... No!
- Oh, yeah.

289
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,937
Dennis, Dennis, I am not fat.
Look, I'm ripped.

290
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,606
I don't know why he did it either, man.
He just did it.

291
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,875
Well, there... it's a long story.

292
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,342
He's not impressed.

293
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,677
What, you don't like the labels?

294
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,213
It doesn't like the labels on the...
these are dumb

295
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,815
"Liberal Tears," right.
Does it say "tear"

296
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,433
or does it say "tear"? It's confusing.

297
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,102
Maybe I'll do a couple
of crunches, though.

298
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:28,369
I'm gonna go put some more lipstick on.

299
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,571
I'm gonna, I'm gonna practice.

300
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,239
Yeah... oh. Yeah. Oh.

301
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,307
Now I'm getting a call again.
It's her again.

302
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,843
Hey, honey.

303
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:38,112
Yeah, I'm just, I'm working...
still working with the ga...

304
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,248
Yeah. Uh, they're all...
You want to say hi or something?

305
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,133
Tell her not to worry
'cause I'm doing crunches.

306
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,636
Oh, yeah, no,
he's doing crunches for Dennis.

307
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,137
No, he's not back.

308
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,339
It's... what do you care
if Dennis is back?

309
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,742
Look... Can I...

310
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,611
Can we just catch up later
when I get home from...

311
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,835
Hang on. I just got an idea.

312
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,905
<i>So it's called "Liberal Tears."</i>

313
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:05,840
I don't know if it's confusing,
that's not really the point.

314
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,642
What I want to know is
what do you think of this?

315
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,611
I think it's super weird.

316
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,581
Like in a good way or like...?

317
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,667
Like in the creepiest
possible way, Charlie.

318
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,002
I mean, it's like Dennis
is sitting in our apartment

319
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,585
just staring at us.

320
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,540
I know, but, like, look,
you need someone to talk to, right?

321
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,475
And I-I just,
I can't be that guy right now.

322
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,010
I'm so busy being a success and stuff.

323
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,212
It's just, like, so much work.

324
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,564
I'm sorry.
You want me to talk to the doll?

325
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,232
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
And-and it's weird,

326
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,801
'cause it's-it's kind of
like he talks back to you.

327
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:36,237
It's crazy. He's already shamed Mac,
which was pretty funny.

328
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,905
All right, I got to run.

329
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:39,507
W-W-Wait. You're leaving? Can I come?

330
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,910
Well, no, sweetie.
It's... I-I got to go work at the bar.

331
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,978
A-And that's gonna be a trigger
for you with all the drinking...

332
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,580
- I feel like like you're always going to the bar...
- Sweetie.

333
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,248
- ...and always running out.
- Oh, sweetie, the feelings.

334
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:50,201
N-N-No. The doll.
That's what the doll is for.

335
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,535
You talk to the doll,

336
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,239
- and-and not me so much.
- Charlie.

337
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:02,363
Mm, sorry. I feel foolish.

338
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,432
You had this, Frank;
I heard you earlier.

339
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,968
I know, but I'm all in my head about it.

340
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,104
Okay, now that makes one, two, three.

341
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,307
- Three bottles of wine.
- Three?

342
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:14,175
You guys have only done three bottles?

343
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,710
Yeah. I'm sorry, Cindy.
We just got a little distracted.

344
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,045
- Yeah.
- Wait. And what happened

345
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,247
to the labels; those just say "wine."

346
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,132
We thought "Liberal Tears"
was maybe gonna be confusing,

347
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,134
- you know?
- Yeah, like, what if people read it like "tears"?

348
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,270
You know, like,
what are these liberals tearing?

349
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,939
- And why are they tearing it?
- Yeah.

350
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,073
And, Dee, what is this?

351
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,209
Oh, it's just a-a new lighting setup.

352
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,611
It-it washes me out.
It's-it's a better look.

353
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,346
Guys, what is happening here?

354
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,748
Everything was going so smoothly.

355
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,232
Yeah, it's nothing. It's fine.

356
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,902
No, it's nothing.
W-We're doing good still, we're good.

357
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,637
- Whatever. We got this.
- Don't worry about us. - Don't know.

358
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,105
Wait a second.

359
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,840
This doesn't have anything
to do with the doll, does it?

360
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:48,776
- Come on. Why would the doll...?
- No.

361
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,379
- The doll? What do we care about the doll?
- The doll...

362
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:52,914
No?

363
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:56,534
- Okay, well, where is the doll?
- It's at my apartment.

364
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,003
Why isn't it in the trash?

365
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,339
It's-it's just doing me a quick favor.

366
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,807
- Get rid of it.
- Yeah.

367
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,343
I don't care. Trash. Burn.
River. Just get rid of it.

368
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,829
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
It was a bad... bad idea.

369
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,413
- Yeah, get rid of it, dude.
- It's going in the trash.

370
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,998
- Yeah, get rid of it, man.
- Yeah. Got to go. Got to go.

371
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:11,966
See, I told him. I told him.

372
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,770
It's just a doll, you know?

373
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,372
It's-it's fun to have around.

374
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:18,840
It's kind of cool.

375
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,308
Hey, it's me.
It looks like Cindy wants me

376
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,842
to get rid of the...

377
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,177
What the hell is this?

378
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,513
Oh, I fucked him.

379
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,381
♪ Bring me a higher love ♪

380
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,934
Well, yeah, I can see that. Why?!

381
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:33,470
Um, because that's what
it was designed for?

382
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,205
You were...
you were supposed to talk to it,

383
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,409
- not have sex with it!
- Okay, well, I<i> did</i> talk to it.

384
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,678
And it told me to drink
this bottle of wine.

385
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,814
And then it talked me
into having sex with it.

386
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,099
I can't... You know,
this is cheating, by the way.

387
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,301
- You're cheating on me.
- Uh, with a doll.

388
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,869
- With Dennis!
- Okay, you sh...

389
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:53,240
His voice<i> is</i> funny.

390
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,376
- Oh, oh, oh! Go to hell!
- I hadn't noticed it.

391
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:57,512
- Go... You go right to hell!
- It's-it's so high.

392
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,046
- Okay. All right. I know.
- Stupid...

393
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,915
No, shh, shh, shh. Everybody, this is...

394
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:05,469
- Yeah, shut up, man!
- This is awkward. I got it.

395
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,006
Charlie, I'm breaking up with you.

396
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,410
You're-you're breaking up with me?

397
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,278
- I think you should leave.
- I'm gonna break up with<i> you!</i>

398
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,748
I already said it.
We think you should get out.

399
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,833
- I can't believe this. I'm out of here.
- Wa-Wa-Wait!

400
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,968
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

401
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,771
Do you have any more bottles of wine?

402
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,676
♪ Bring me a higher love. ♪

403
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,204
I'm sorry, Charlie. This sucks.

404
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,407
I mean, I think maybe some fresh
titty will cheer you up, huh?

405
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:44,808
- Yeah.
- Charlie, the waitress

406
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,544
is an asshole.
You're just way better off

407
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,546
- without her.
- Yeah. No, you're right.

408
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,681
I'm-I'm just pissed that
Dennis did that to me.

409
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:51,899
- Of course.
- You know what I mean?

410
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,635
- Dennis is a bastard, man. Right?
- Yeah.

411
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,170
- Always has been, always has been.
- I mean, dude, look around.

412
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:57,504
You're in the strip club, man.

413
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,307
- Okay!
- We always go to the strip club

414
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,708
- to make ourselves feel better.
- That's right.

415
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:02,443
- This is fun. Right?
- Yeah, okay. Yes.

416
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,178
Yes.

417
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,046
I feel like I'm forcing it a little.

418
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,582
- It feels forced, right?
- Yeah.

419
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,733
- Why is that?
- Why are we here?

420
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,868
Yeah, I mean, look, guys,
I think the problem is

421
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,737
that we're trying to do
things that we<i> used</i> to do.

422
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,471
But-but things are different now.

423
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,007
Look, Dennis is gone,
and he is not coming back.

424
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,609
We have to accept that.

425
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,145
Yeah, why are we letting Dennis
keep messing up our lives?

426
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,480
- He's not even here, man.
- Yeah. Absolutely. Right.

427
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,699
Like, it's time
to move on from that guy.

428
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:27,101
And if I'm being perfectly honest,
I like Cindy better.

429
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,103
Oh, yeah. She's smart, she's funny.

430
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,505
- Yes.
- She's an asshole but in all the right ways.

431
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,908
- She's just the right amount of asshole, you know?
- Yeah, exactly.

432
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,510
She's kind of like Dennis
but only way better.

433
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:37,445
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Better than Dennis.

434
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,447
I absolutely prefer her to Dennis.

435
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,854
- Right?
- I like her more.

436
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,000
So, look, maybe we just got
to put Dennis behind us,

437
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,735
- finally, once and for all...
- Mm.

438
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,970
...and move forward, with Cindy,

439
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,140
and be a new gang.

440
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,459
To the new gang.

441
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,260
- There you go.
- The new Cindy gang.

442
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,879
- Yeah, right! New gang!
- New gang, new gang. - New gang with Cindy.

443
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,614
Cindy.

444
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,233
All right, what do we do with him?

445
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,702
Not sure yet.

446
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:03,504
But, uh, what do you say we do,
like, three rounds of shots

447
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,838
- and figure it out after that?
- Hey!

448
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,140
Hey!

449
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:11,913
Hey-o! So sorry we're late.

450
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,631
Guys, what the hell?
The Murphy's protest

451
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,134
is about to start. Where is everyone?

452
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,868
Cindy, we just wanted to let
you know that you were right

453
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,271
- about everything, and we think you are amazing.
- Yes, yes.

454
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,808
Now, we were at the strip club
last night, and we came up with a way

455
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,344
to deal with our Dennis
issues and do your plan

456
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,546
- and finally move forward.
- Yeah.

457
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,698
Guys? Let's do it!

458
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:40,842
Oh, God.

459
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,244
Oh, yuck!

460
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,845
No, stop! Stop it!

461
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,447
Stop! Charlie, stop!

462
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,800
How is this moving things forward?
What are you doing?

463
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,601
Oh, I was playing his asshole.

464
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,419
That part I got. Why?

465
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,138
Well, well, after a series of events

466
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,740
- that I'd rather not go into...
- Not necessary.

467
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,342
I came to the realization
that the only way

468
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,412
to not be humiliated by Dennis
while playing the tuba

469
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,946
- was to play<i> him.</i>
- But then,

470
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,498
out front, he got a little nervous

471
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,367
- about doing that. Yeah. He got a little gun-shy.
- I couldn't do it.

472
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,835
- So I volunteered.
- Yeah.

473
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,704
Well, you see,
we're still making Paddy's great again,

474
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,773
- but now everybody's happy.
- That's right, that's right.

475
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,640
So, what do you think?

476
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,108
You want to know what I think?

477
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,311
- Yeah.
- Um, here's what I think.

478
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,847
I think that you all went
to a strip club last night

479
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,666
and you got super hammered and horny

480
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,268
and the three of you
decided to fuck the doll,

481
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,071
only to find out that when
force is applied to the almost

482
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,140
vacuum-tight polyurethane hole,

483
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,142
it made a noise.

484
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,810
You instantly put it in your mouth.

485
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,546
You probably knew it'd work, because

486
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,131
you clearly have had sex
with the doll multiple times.

487
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,833
You decided that this was
the most brilliant idea

488
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,502
that you've ever come up with,
when, really, it was the result

489
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,373
of the most insane, disgusting
orgy that has ever taken place.

490
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,243
And you, Dee, you just sat back
and watched the whole thing

491
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,245
happen because you are so
numb to this kind of behavior

492
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:54,448
that it doesn't even
register to you as odd.

493
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,668
- That's dead-on.
- Yeah, you nailed it.

494
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,537
- You nailed it. I mean, like...
- Boy, that... - Wow. Yeah.

495
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,405
- Point by point.
- You ran home with that one.

496
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,674
Guys, come on. You are better than this.

497
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,076
I know you can<i> be</i> better than this.
And I can help you.

498
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,212
But you got to make a choice, okay?

499
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,481
You can either leave Dennis behind

500
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,700
or you can stay the same.

501
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,035
Keep doing what you're doing...

502
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,769
playing a doll's asshole with your mouth

503
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:18,455
and talking to something that's
never gonna talk back to you.

504
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:19,640
Or will it?

505
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,909
Oh, shit!

506
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:23,311
- Kill it!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

507
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:28,132
Oh. Hey, hey. Take it easy, man.
I'm not a doll.

508
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,401
I threw that thing on the floor.
By the way, what is that thing?

509
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,936
I don't like it. Why do you have it?

510
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,871
- It's for Mac.
- Yeah.

511
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,540
Oh, Mac's shooting his loads into it?

512
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,607
- Definitely his. He definitely is.
- No, no.

513
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,276
Yeah. All right, well, anyway,

514
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,610
I'm back. The real me.

515
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,212
Let's not-not make a whole thing of it.

516
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,346
You.

517
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,165
Uh, I gather
you were meant to replace me?

518
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,435
Well, that's not necessary
anymore, so, um,

519
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,236
you can go now.

520
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,971
Excuse me?

521
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,840
I think<i> you</i> can go.

522
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,842
You dress like it's 1998.

523
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:57,311
Your look is played out and so are you.

524
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,846
- You're basic.
- Oh. I see.

525
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:01,465
Well, why don't we, uh...

526
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,601
- why don't we ask them?
- Yeah, sure.

527
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,270
- Oh...
- Well, he did just get here,

528
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,539
- so let's not go crazy, right?
- Kind of like seeing him.

529
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,141
Charlie, you were just playing
his asshole to humiliate him.

530
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,743
- Ah.
- I do lots of crazy things, you know?

531
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,345
- I never really know what I'm...
- Yeah. - That's in the past.

532
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,547
- Yeah. I mean...
- And I like to live in the present.

533
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,432
Dee, you don't want this loser back,
do you?

534
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,701
I mean...

535
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,903
- What? Come on.
- Uh...

536
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,505
They're just gonna go back
to treating you like shit

537
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:25,840
the minute I leave!

538
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,708
Come on, us ladies,
we got to stick together.

539
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,310
Yeah, yeah, I hear what you're saying,

540
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,312
but I kind of like being the only woman.

541
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,646
'Cause it makes me feel special.

542
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:34,865
This is insane. You know what?
Screw you guys.

543
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,935
Enjoy your crappy lives and your insane,
miserable, failed ideas.

544
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,354
You guys are played out. You're basic.

545
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,938
- Uh-oh.
- Ooh, yeah. You know what?

546
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,541
- You already said that. Uh...
- Yeah.

547
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,409
- You did. She said that already.
- A second ago.

548
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,877
Did you run out of insults?

549
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,745
- Recycling her material.
- Yeah. That's not good.

550
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,814
- She didn't have to have a bad attitude about it.
- That's not good. Yeah. Hey,

551
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,246
- I don't know about you guys,
- What a bitch.

552
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,347
but I'm a little bit thirsty.

553
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,036
Do you guys still serve beer here,
or...?

554
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,571
- Oh, yeah.
- I knew you were gonna say something funny, man.

555
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,439
- So smart, too. Clever.
- Do we serve beer? - Because we're a bar.

556
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,094
- Clever. Yeah.
- Do we serve beer?

557
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:01,995
- Funny, man.
- We do.

558
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,444
Well, welcome back, man.

559
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:06,780
- Well, for now. I'm back for now.
- Oh? All right.

560
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:07,981
Guys, you know what?

561
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,299
I think we just made
Paddy's great again.

562
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:11,802
Shut up, bird.

563
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,338
- Oh!
- Oh!

564
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,539
So reliable.

565
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,607
Yeah, yeah,
you can just count on it.

566
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,942
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

567
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,145
Hey, Mac, did you gain a little weight?
