1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,546
[Tool Clicking] [Frank] You gotta
be careful of the wire, Charlie.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,799
[Charlie] I'm not gonna pinch the wire.
I know what I'm doing.

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,009
'Cause then the brake lights don't work.
I know what I'm doing.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,637
Make sure it's on tight.
It's on as tight as it's gonna get!

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,180
Okay. All right.
It's on good and tight.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,182
Hey, Dennis, I think we should
get, like, a G.P.S. System,

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,185
'cause these maps are from, like, the '70s, dude.
G.P.S. System? Oh, hell, no!

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,229
No? That's gonna ruin the
road trip experience.

9
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:25,191
We gotta go do this old school, baby.
Maps, fresh cigarettes, fresh coffee,

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,694
cooking out on the grill, sleeping
in sleeping bags. Old school.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,278
Old school, baby!
I'm into that!

12
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:30,488
Campfire.
Let's do old school!

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,781
Old school, yeah!
Oh, shit. [Horn Honks]

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,367
- Oh, shit.
- Who is that? That Sweet Dee?

15
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,160
That's Dee.
That's Sweet Dee.

16
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,578
Oh, goddamn it.
What is that car?

17
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,247
What is she doing here?
[Charlie] What car is that?

18
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,249
Ah, shit. Okay, don't- don't-
Just don't say anything.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,584
Hey, guys. What's with the trailer?
[Mac] Hey.

20
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,545
None of your business.
What are you doing here so early?

21
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,548
- Why are you at work early? - I woke up early
this morning and went and bought a new car.

22
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,007
It's pretty sweet.
Where you guys going?

23
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,760
- We're going to the Grand Canyon.
- Goddamn it, Frank!

24
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,804
- Really? - Frank wants to
see it before he dies, so...

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,890
Yeah, what happened was he told us
about a road trip. We got all excited.

26
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,892
We got up super early
and we packed the car...

27
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,312
- and were hoping to get out of here before your bus arrived.
- You were just gonna ditch me?

28
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,440
Nah, it's cool.
I'm gonna stick around.

29
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,734
Yeah. Charlie's too scared. Yeah.
He's never left Philly before.

30
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,861
I'm not scared!
I just haven't left Philly.

31
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,779
Why leave Philly, you know?
He's frightened.

32
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,322
- I want to go.
- No, you're not going.

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,032
You can't come
'cause it'll take forever.

34
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,201
Yeah, and you're gonna have to pee every
five minutes. It's gonna be stupid.

35
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,953
I'm not gonna get stuck
behind with Charlie.

36
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,748
Wait a second! If you go, I'm gonna
be all by myself in the bar.

37
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,751
That's messed up, guys. I mean, that's
more change than, like, even if I went.

38
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,044
- You know what? Maybe I should go.
- Great. We're all in.

39
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,213
It's gonna be packed in the car!
No, we're not all in.

40
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,133
- Yeah, we're going.
- We're going on a road trip, baby!

41
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,677
Why did you have to buy
a new car today of all days?

42
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,554
I'll go get my stuff.

43
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,464
[Dee] I can't believe you've never
been out of Philly, Charlie.

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,050
Yeah, man. What the hell?
I've never done a lot of things.

45
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,386
What else have you not done, bro?
Uh, I've never eaten a pear.

46
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,847
What? How is that possible?
Seriously.

47
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,558
Really? Pears weird me out, dude.
Where do you start with a pear?

48
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,102
The top, the bottom?
What do you mean, where do you start?

49
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,104
Just bite into it. It's a fruit.
You just start it.

50
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,273
Really? You just bite it?
It's a weird-looking thing.

51
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,400
Okay, you know what?
Pull over. I'm getting this kid a pear.

52
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,778
No, no. No pulling over!
We've got a schedule. Yeah, no, no.

53
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,613
I would love to take a quick leak.
Are you serious?

54
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,823
Oh, Deandra!
We just left!

55
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,407
That's what
I was worried about.

56
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,576
And it can't just be any pear, dude.
It's gotta be a fresh one.

57
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,411
Let's go to the Italian market.
Oh, okay.

58
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,580
Hey-oh! The Italian market
is way out of our way.

59
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,165
Nah.
Dennis, do you have to smoke?

60
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,959
It's coming right back
in through my window.

61
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,294
Roll your window up then,
Dee, 'cause I'm a-smoking.

62
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,088
The window needs to be
down for the fresh air.

63
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,131
Hey, I've never had
blueberries either. What?

64
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,967
What are you talking about?
That's crazy!

65
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,427
That is completely insane.
We're definitely going to the Italian market.

66
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,304
Dennis, let's go.
You believe this guy? Jesus!

67
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,931
- What guy?
- Guy on the bike.

68
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,516
He's taking up
the whole goddamn road.

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,435
Ride on the sidewalk if you're
gonna ride a bike, asshole!

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,187
[Honking] What was that?

71
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,189
He flicked you off, dude.
Is that what that was?

72
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,774
He flicked you off, man.
Son of a bitch.

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,985
Real chip on his shoulder, huh?
You wanna egg him?

74
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,945
Yeah, I wanna egg him.
You got eggs?

75
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,072
No. That would have been good though.
That would've been good, man.

76
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,992
You know what? I'm gonna fire a beer
across his bow. Ruffle his feathers.

77
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,035
Yeah, give him a good scare?
Yeah, man.

78
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,413
[Dee] Yeah. Jerk.
Get up real close to him.

79
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,707
Hey, asshole.
Ooh!

80
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, shit!

81
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,337
[All] Oh!

82
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,506
Shit!
I hit him! I hit him!

83
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,592
You hit him in the back of the head!
I didn't mean to.

84
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,969
- That is not how I expected
that to go at all. - Is he okay?

85
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,221
- Did we kill him?
- I don't know. Oh, he's getting up.

86
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,181
[Frank] He's moving, he's moving.
[Mac] Yeah, he's getting up.

87
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,183
Thank God, dude. God.
Should we help him out?

88
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,603
[Mac] And he's getting something out of his bag.
[Dennis] What's he getting?

89
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,772
It's a pipe. It's a pipe?
Go, go, go, go, go!

90
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,650
- [Dee] Go, go, go, go!
- [All Shouting At Once]

91
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,278
What's wrong with your tires?
The car's scraping.

92
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,947
[Charlie] All right, get back to the bar.
Get back to the bar.

93
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,826
Damn it!

94
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,871
Goddamn it!
Shit!

95
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,457
These tires are completely destroyed.
Ah, shit!

96
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,751
I'm just gonna pop inside
real quick, take a quick squirt.

97
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,420
Unbelievable. How about we put a
couple of doughnuts on there?

98
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,548
Oh, right, Frank. We're gonna go to
the Grand Canyon on spare tires.

99
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,886
Uh, plus there's a good deal of
mountain bike in your axle here, bro.

100
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,764
[Dennis] Seriously, dude? Yeah.
We're talking structural damage down there.

101
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,515
There's leakage.
Things are sparking.

102
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,518
All right. Well, road trip's off.
No, no, no, no, no.

103
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,397
Road trip's not off.
I have a good idea.

104
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,243
Not bad, right?
Nah.

105
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,245
It's kinda nice.
Lot of leg room.

106
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,289
It's a smooth ride.
You guys got a lot of room back there?

107
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,416
Oh, yeah. We got easy
access to the beers too.

108
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,418
I mean, that's a good touch.
New car smell.

109
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,796
Mmm. How do you get that in a used car?
What is that?

110
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,297
It's a spray.
Yeah, it's a spray.

111
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,757
Oh, yeah.
It's nice.

112
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,801
I enjoy it, man.
I'm glad that they did that. It's nice.

113
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,720
I wish that this light would hurry up and change.
That's the only thing. Uh-oh!

114
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,516
- Hey! Hey, you bastards!
- [All Groan]

115
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,768
You jerks! Hey! Hey!
[Dennis] Ah, here we go.

116
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,145
Goddamn it! Get out!
[Charlie] All right.

117
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,690
All right, all right, all right.
It's my car. I'm driving. Get out!

118
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,316
I got window!
Get out!

119
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,567
[Charlie]
You call window, Frank?

120
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,236
You jerks!
I got window.

121
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,947
[Dee] You guys are dicks.
It took you long enough.

122
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,241
You were taking forever!
Did you still want to go?

123
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,743
Shut up! It's really cramped
back here with this cooler.

124
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,745
Why don't you put
the cooler in the trailer?

125
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,082
Because then, Dee, we're gonna have to pull
over every single time we want a beer.

126
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,710
That new car smell is starting to give me a headache.
Dennis, give me a cigarette.

127
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,211
You want a cigarette?
Yeah.

128
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,255
I'm gonna have one too.
Do you guys have to smoke in here?

129
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,257
Yeah- Well, your car reeks, Dee, so-
[Blows Raspberry]

130
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,050
God, dude, this thing
is so heavy!

131
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm gonna get a blood clot
with this thing! Oh, my God!

132
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,387
Why don't you put it
in the trailer?

133
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,432
Why don't I put you in the trailer?
Good one, Charlie.

134
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,726
That's actually not a bad idea.
I wouldn't mind riding back there.

135
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,228
There's a hell of a lot more room.
I'm done with that.

136
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,397
[Both Exclaim] [Dee] Oh, come on!

137
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,525
Oh, it's in my- Get it!
You're gonna burn a hole in the new upholstery!

138
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,944
It's not new upholstery.
What makes you think it's new upholstery?

139
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,654
Did you get it?
Oh, yeah!

140
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,489
This sucks! Deandra, pull over.
This is terrible.

141
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,324
I wanna go in the back with Dennis.
Yeah.

142
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,619
You guys ride in back, and we'll- Yeah.
We'll go in the back.

143
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,834

It's not gonna slide through the crack?

286
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,946
It won't because I measured the crack, and the
crack is smaller than the height of the grill.

Like, is anything bad gonna happen?

I got a proposition for you, man.
Check this out.

315
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,618
What do you say we smash
these wicker chairs to bits,

316
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,078
put them in the middle
of the U-Haul- which is metal...

317
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,164
and we burn the wicker chairs
and cook the hot dogs on that?

318
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,958
What do you mean?
Cook the hot dogs over the fire?

319
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,170
And then we'll get some new wicker chairs
next time we're at a Gypsy hangout spot.

320
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,672
Okay. You think we're gonna be
going to a lot of those?

'Cause I feel like I already dodged a
bullet once today. What do you mean?

322
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,889
Well, I mean, you know, Gypsies- I don't
want anyone shrinking my head and shit.

323
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,099
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, first of all,

324
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,101
it was not Gypsies ever
that did that.

325

That's sort of
a witch doctor thing.

326

But either way, neither one
of them can shrink heads.

[Frank Groans]

432
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,199
- Oh, are we back at Paddy's?
- Wait. Where the hell is my car?

433
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,742
Oh, goddamn!

434
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,619
Shit balls!
What's going on?

435
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,830
[Gasps]

436
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,290
[Yawns] Hey, you guys are back!

437
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,919
- How was the Grand Canyon?
- What the hell happened to my car, Charlie?

438
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,047
I don't know. Last thing I remember,
uh, we were at the gas station.

439
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,217
And then you guys hopped in back, and I
hopped in front with the hitchhiker.

440
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,554
Then I got freaked out about leaving Philly,
so I asked him if he'd drop me off back here.

441
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,057
And he said he'd take you guys to the Grand Canyon,
and then I drank all night and passed out.

442
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,018
And then you guys were getting here now,
so I figured- Did you go and come back?

443
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,020
He didn't take us
to the Grand Canyon.

444
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,022
He detached the trailer
and stole my car!

445
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,858
Really?
Yeah!

446
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,402
The weird thing is that Mac had already
cleared him as a security risk.

447
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,863
Did an ocular pat-down on him.
Amazing, right?

448
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,573
- You cleared him, Mac?
- I cleared him.

449
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,116
Goddamn it!
I thought he was clear!

450
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,076
He wasn't clear! I'm calling the cops.
He was clear.

451
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,453
I thought Mac cleared him.
I didn't think there'd be a problem.

452
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,581
I don't know how- I kinda had
a good time on the trip.

453
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,208
Looking on the bright side
of things. All right?

454
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,586
Let's drink some beers, man.
I'm hungover as shit. Absolutely, man.

455
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,131
- Little hair of the dog. - That was the closest
I ever got to being out of Philly, man.

456
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,841
All right, cheers.
Cheers, you guys.

457
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,259
Texas. Oops.
State game?

458
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,760
Ohio.
Rhode Island.

459
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,762
Nice.
Uh, Detroit.

460
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,514
Nope.
That's not a state. Drink.

461
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,309
Milwaukee!
