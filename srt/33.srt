1
00:00:01,306 --> 00:00:05,477
Would you describe these
pieces more savory or succulent.

2
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:07,299
It's definitely way too
over cooked to be succulent,

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,489
but it's still pretty delicious.

4
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:09,755
It's still savory, right?

5
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:11,525
Now, what if we insert it in beer?

6
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:13,698
Do you think that would
help like regain it's succulence.

7
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,060
- Like a beer-rub.
- hu-hum.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,915
That's actually really smart.
Mac, grab us some beers.

9
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:19,100
Bite my bird.
What are you eating?

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,152
Oh, dude, Dee and I
cooked up a great steak.

11
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:24,483
Frank's got, like, this whole fridge full of
these delicious meats that I've been stealing.

12
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:25,460
You guys wanna try some of this?

13
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,080
Someone who sweats as much as
you should not work with food.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,668
Charlie?

15
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:30,968
You son of a bitch!

16
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:33,670
I told you stay away from my meat!

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,412
- Spit it out.
- Come on.

18
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,018
Spit it! Spit it out!

19
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:36,664
Now!

20
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:38,331
You too. Spit!

21
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:39,660
Come on.

22
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,261
Right there.

23
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,839
Why you're being such a selfish jerk?

24
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:42,618
Hey!

25
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:45,115
I killed the dear,
I should get to eat it.

26
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,695
That's the natural order.

27
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:47,680
Wait, you shot a dear?

28
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,398
That's right. 10 point buck

29
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,261
Ping!

30
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:52,295
Right between the sorrowful little eyes.

31
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,776
Since when do you, bro?

32
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,455
Since always.
I'm a great hunter.

33
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,079
How does hunting a defenseless
creature make you a good hunter?

34
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,710
Yeah, you should go after something
that could at least defend itself.

35
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,211
You know, a really great hunter would go
after something that can hunt him back.

36
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:06,802
- Like a man!
- Hell yeah, dude, a man?

37
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:08,498
Don't even joke about hunting a man.

38
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:09,684
Who's joking?
I'm not joking.

39
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:13,108
I think that hunting a man would be
the only true test of a good hunter.

40
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,708
Yeah? I was hunted once.

41
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,290
I just came back from Nam.

42
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,599
I was hitching through Oregon

43
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,487
and some cop started harassing me.

44
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,867
Next thing you know, I had a whole army
of cops chasing me through the woods.

45
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:25,186
I had to take 'em all out.
It was a bloodbath.

46
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:27,380
That's Rambo, dude.

47
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:29,004
What?

48
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:31,621
You just described the plot of Rambo.

49
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,350
Yeah, that's the first
from the first one.

50
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,253
Yeah, I think you gave
us the life of the Rambo.

51
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:38,351
That's not the first time you've described
your life in the way of John Rambo's like.

52
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,300
Yeah, you know what?

53
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,860
It's actually making me think I
can get on board with man-hunt.

54
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,491
Really?

55
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:44,107
- Me, too, dude.
- I'm just throw that out there.

56
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:44,768
No.

57
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:48,041
You do not go on a man-hunt.

58
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,909
- Screw ya.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,007
Try that one.

63
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:24,932
- This one?
- hu-hum.

64
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:27,410
- Good, a little bit of sauce with.
- We don't have any slice left.

65
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,539
- It was just the The Natural Juice of two by the way.
- Oh, so good!

66
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,637
It's not actual sauce.

67
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,396
Oh, my god, good job!

00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:35,529
I can't believe that dick horrible
put the lock on the refrigerator.

69
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,961
- What a sonofabitch.
- That wasn't cool.

70
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,559
You know what though?
At least he forgot about this piece.

71
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,392
What a dump ass.

72
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,501
Did you do something different thought?
'cause it's sooo good this time.

73
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,930
- I barely cooked it.
- Really?

74
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,037
I'm talking like not at all.

75
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:44,950
- No kiddin'.
- hu hum.

76
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,634
What I did, I slopped through
the radiator for minute.

77
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,937
- That's pretty bogus.
- not warmed it.

78
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:49,342
No, but it's cleaned up.

79
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:50,355
It's so good though.
I don't care.

80
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,830
Okay, good.
But here's a good side.

81
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,866
Well, well, well~

82
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:55,238
What have we here.

83
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:58,361
Looks like you two're
up and enjoying my meat!

84
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,428
Yes, we have a new fashious meat hug.

85
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:01,854
Yeah, hey, Franky.

86
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:05,379
Sharing it.
It's a rule now~

87
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,439
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves.

88
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,183
Maybe we should open up
a bottle of desert wine.

89
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,236
A nice port,

90
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:17,273
that would compliment
what you have just eaten.

91
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:19,252
By the way,

92
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,057
you know what you've just eaten, right?

93
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:22,707
Was it venison?

94
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:24,431
You wish it was venison.

95
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,190
Was it a horse?

96
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:26,181
Horse?

97
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:29,379
That, which you have just eaten, that,

98
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:33,094
which your teeth have just torn apart.

99
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:37,381
Your taste buds have savored, that

100
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,621
was human meat.

101
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:42,868
- Yeah, ok.
- So stupid.

102
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,507
- You're so stupid!
- Well, thank you for the human meat, Frank.

103
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:45,743
Thank you for our human meat.

104
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,070
- No, you're welcome.
- It was delicious.

105
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,452
- I knew you're gonna steal from me again.
- You're stupid.

106
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,985
- That's why I put a lock on the fridge.
- Yeah.

107
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:57,312
- And only left one piece of meat out.
- I get it.

108
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,448
- Human meat
- Alright.

109
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,646
Where'd you get the
human meat from, Frank?

110
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,460
- I got a guy.
- You got a guy?

111
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,695
Oh, you got a human meat guy?

112
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:07,831
- I got a guide for everything, Charlie.
- You're so full of shit.

113
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,487
- Yeah, ok, right.
- Oh, yeah, Deandra, you think I'm full of shit?
- hu hum

114
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,823
- Well, you enjoy yourselves, now.
- Thank you.

115
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:17,638
- I am glad you had a good time eating human meat.
- Thank you.

116
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,587
- That wasn't human meat though, right?
- No~~~!

117
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,464
Hey yo.
Dennis, I did it.

118
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,533
It took me all day, but I finally finished a
list of ten people that would be perfect to hunt.

119
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,573
Great, and I totally respect your opinion,
but I've already made a decision.

120
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,674
That's the complete opposite
of respecting my opinion.

121
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:41,874
Hey, don't I know it.

122
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:42,876
Check it out, bro.

123
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:46,470
Hey!

124
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,978
Dennis, are you sure Dee is coming?

125
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:51,387
Yeah, yeah, she's coming.
She wants to look great for your big date.

126
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:53,808
- Do I get that right? Are you serious?
- Yeah, man, he's perfect.

127
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,188
You don't believe?
Check it out.

128
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:58,232
Hey, Cricket, will you, come
out here for few second please.

129
00:04:58,644 --> 00:04:59,208
Yeah.

130
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,145
just stand before us here.

131
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:01,926
Now, check out his legs.

132
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,462
See how they're almost tierd?
They're like pretty much back to perfect.

133
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:04,995
Yeah.

134
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,156
And check out his cane.

135
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:09,403
Looks like he's whittled it into
some sort of defensive tool.

136
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,627
Wow.

137
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,966
But, that makes you
quite formidable, huh?

138
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,523
Ok, what's going on here, huh?

139
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,228
- Where is Dee?
- Admit it, Mac.

140
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,861
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

141
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,941
Yeah, he'll do just fine.

142
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:23,285
Oh, god, oh, god.
I know you're up to something.

143
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:25,365
You're gonna harvest
my organs, aren't you?

144
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,114
- Yeah,
- Hey, relax.

145
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:30,191
- You're gonna rope me and you're gonna harvest my organs.
- Relax, Cricket, relax, relax, take it easy.

146
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,367
You don't wanna be all nervous
and sweaty when Dee gets here.

147
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,064
It's ture she's coming?

148
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,267
Ok, ok.

149
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,894
Yeah, for second there, I thought you
guys're gonna do something terrible to me.

150
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:39,987
Yeah, we are.
Stack on 'em.

151
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,170
No, we're gonna hunt you.

152
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,546
What?

153
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,261
We are going to hunt you, Cricket.

154
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:48,313
Why?

155
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:51,413
Uh.. I'll spend a lot less time
asking questions, more time running.

156
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:51,928
Yeah.

157
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:54,516
What, what happens if.. if I get caught?

158
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,172
- Wu, don't get caught.
- Don't get caught.

159
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,263
There he goes

160
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:02,388
and hunt begins!

161
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:03,652
Indeed, indeed.

162
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,239
-This gonna be fun.
- Yeah.

163
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,310
What do you suppose gonna
happen when we do catch him?

164
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,229
- Well, I suppose we do some tea-bag related.
- hum

165
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,055
Dee!

166
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,006
You're home, thank god.

167
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:17,599
Ok, let's talk. Let's have a quick
conversation, huh? What do you think?

168
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,247
- I couldn't sleep last night, could you?
- Nope.

169
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:20,067
And I'll tell you why.

170
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,441
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

171
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,244
What's going on?

172
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:23,763
Oh my god, Charlie.
I didn't wanna say anything,

173
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:26,154
but I'm thinking there's some strange
going on with this meat, such a wish.

174
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:29,572
Yes, ok, now, I know it's crazy.
The idea Frank feeding us human meat.

175
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,963
- Yes!
- But, I'm trying to disapprove it.

176
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,123
- I absolutely can.
- You can't do it, can you?

177
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,293
Let's talk to taste.

178
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,425
- The taste!
- the taste, Charlie, I tried everything.
- I can't get the taste out of my mouth!

179
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:39,174
- You can't get it out, right?
- Absolutely not.

180
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:40,732
- And if you try all source of other meats,
- Yes!

181
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,724
- like daily meats and sandwich meats.
- Absolutely!

182
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:45,762
And then did you go crazy?
Just looking everything in your apartment,

183
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:48,970
like your shoe, item with a catch fanny,
like nothing's working, right?

184
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,939
Maybe, it's a trick.

185
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,544
Ok? Maybe, he went and got some weird,
exotic meat that we wouldn't thank to try.

186
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,606
- Ok, it's not like regular grocery store kind of meat.
- No, not meat from a grocery store.

187
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:59,657
He got it from some weird place.

188
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:02,035
Ok, let's, let's think here.
Let's put our heads together.

189
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,418
Where could Frank go
to get mysterious meat?

190
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,305
- This is the place, huh?
- This is where I can find.

191
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:16,066
Just start grabbing as
much stuff as you can.

192
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,728
Ok, we'll take, um,
that big brown mound and

193
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:21,234
the curly stuff and then this
thing looks like a blanket.

194
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,076
- Try some of that.
- Definitely.

195
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:25,326
Oh, oh, what about a monkey?
Monkeys are like nature's humans.

196
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,769
I doubt they have monkey, Charlie.

197
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:28,349
People eat monkey, Dee.

198
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,084
They're eating type of doom.
Have you ever see that?

199
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:30,924
Hey.

200
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:34,396
We got monkey.

201
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:36,938
Oh.

202
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:38,881
Well, we'll look at that.
Great!

203
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,489
Uh, one monkey also then, please.

204
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,640
Yeah, baby. This hunt is
gonna be so awesome, dude.

205
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,894
Yeah, bud. This is what it must feel like,
before you go to battle.

206
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,888
Oh my god, I know man.
I'm so exited, feel my nips.

207
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:58,302
- Holy smokes!
- They're, like, super hard, right?

208
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,950
- You can cut glass with these bad boys.
- I know, right?

209
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,484
What the hell are you doing?

210
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,902
- I'm feeling his nips, Frank.
- Yeah, man, I'm so exited for this hunt

211
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,248
- and my nips are doing stuff
they've never done before. Feel 'em.
- Look at these.

212
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:07,965
What hunt?

213
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,153
We're gonna hunt Cricket.

214
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,058
I thought we went over this already.

215
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,877
You do not hunt a man.

216
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:14,606
Come on, man. Don't bring
it down, not right now.

217
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:15,942
Not when my nips are like this.

218
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,745
You know you hunt a man,

219
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,792
he can snap like a toig.

220
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,580
Next thing you know,

221
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,560
he's up at night,

222
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,786
he's burning down a village of Nam,

223
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:28,376
he's killing everything that moves,
everything that lives!

224
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:30,107
You're talking about Rambo again.

225
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:32,017
Oh, no.
That happened to me.

226
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,588
Yeah, you're thinking about
John Rambo's life, every time.

227
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,307
No, I'm not.
This happened to me.

228
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,637
- That never happened to you, Frank.
- It happened to me, Mac.

229
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,936
Yeah, you're confused
your life with Rambo again.

230
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:44,060
No.

231
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,888
No, Charlie. This is not
right. I still have the crazy.

232
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:49,449
I have, too.  I have even
worse than before I take.

233
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,174
- There's something really
weirdoes happening to me.
- I'll tell you what's going on.

234
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,124
Frank bet it's human meat,
and we got the hunger.

235
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:54,213
- The hunger?
- hu hum.

236
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,791
That's how you become a cannibal, Dee.

237
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,837
Like, you get one taste of
delicious, delicious human meat,

238
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,905
none of these stuff ever satisfies you,
ever again for the rest of your life.

239
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,533
- Now, I just think that you're overreacting, okay?
- Oh, really?

240
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,894
Yeah, that's stupid.

241
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:05,895
Is that stupid?

242
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,392
Oh, I'm sorry, Dee.

243
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,668
Well, then I guess
Jaws IV is stupid, ok?

244
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,059
'cause that's exact same plot.

245
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,603
Ok, alright. Calm down.

246
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:16,577
Before you start accusing us of becoming cannibals
or sharks or whatever is you're trying to say,

247
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:19,639
I think we need to find out if
what we ate was actually human.

248
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,533
Oh, shit. That's what we've been doing.

249
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,288
- I ate a fu** monkey, Dee.
- Charlie?

250
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:24,478
You don't understand me.

251
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,470
I think we need to try a piece of human flesh.

252
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, god.

253
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,022
just to make sure.

254
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:31,805
That's the only way.

255
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,464
- Right?
- Ok.

256
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,481
How're we gonna do this?

257
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,904
The morgue?
Hear me out.

258
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:37,086
- It's a dead body...
- Sold.

259
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,901
You don't even have to tell me, man.
That's where you find a dead body, right?

260
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,325
- Great idea, right?
- We'll have a tiny little bit.

261
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:42,851
- They won't even know.
- We'll be off the hook.

262
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,720
- Well, no for sure.
- I got a hot plate.

263
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,685
I wanna get some beers.

264
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,451
Any sight of him?

265
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:53,727
No, but uh, word on the street is he's
out of here begging must Saturdays.

266
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,155
He'll be here.
Don't worry about it.

267
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:56,908
God, hunting is awesome, Dennis.

268
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:59,102
- Yeah.
- You get to wear sweet clothes and get wasted all day.

269
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:02,816
It's just like our normal lives, except at the end
of it we get to put our nuts in some dude's mouth.

270
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,749
ah... yeah, actually I wanted to
talk to you about that aspect of it.

271
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,038
What's up? You're not
happy with the plan?

272
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,539
No, now look, we'd been tea-bagging
Cricket since high school, you know?

273
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,903
I feel like we need
to make some progress.

274
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,226
I think we should
give him a gorilla mask.

275
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,405
What's a gorilla mask?

276
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:17,751
You put some sticky over his face,

277
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,002
and then sprinkle it with shaved pubes.

278
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,103
umm, no, I don't like it.

279
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,739
What? What's not to like?

280
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,345
Cricket with a face full of pubes?
Hilarious!

281
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,466
Yeah, but where're we supposed
to get that many pubes, man?

282
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,265
- We shave!
- Now, that's gonna be a problem, I laser.

283
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:30,764
It's like a turtle shell down there.

284
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:32,586
What?

285
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,973
Yeah, look man.
The classic surculose for reason, ok?

286
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:37,354
- Why going nuts with that?
- It's called progress, Dennis.

287
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,355
Well, I wanna make progress.
So, I'm sticking with the tea-bagging.

288
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,841
But tea-bagging doesn't
even leave a mark!

289
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,389
Well, fine, I'll dip my nuts in ink or something
and then put it in his mouth, that make you happy?

290
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,720
Well... Yeah, actually, I
think that's a pretty good idea.

291
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,230
Yeah, because it leaves
a mark all over it, and..

292
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,266
- Holy shit, let me just hunt.
- It's an excellent idea.

293
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,431
- It's like we can dunk him down and, like hooo~
- Cheers, man, let me went through that.

294
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,628
- See?  We're free thinking outside hot.
- I like it.

295
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,775
Cricket! Get him.

296
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,670
Get, get, get, get!

297
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,724
Ok, how did his legs just do that?

298
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:22,610
- I'm not doing that, Dennis.
- No, that was incredibly dangerous.

299
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,929
- Let's go pow chop in that case.
- Did not know what he was capable of.

300
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,282
- Hi.
- Hey.

301
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,288
Sorry to bug you here.

302
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:37,470
How are you?

303
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,137
I'm good.

304
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:41,771
We're two friends of one of the
dead people that you have in there.

305
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:43,212
Close friends.

306
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,563
- And we wanted to..
- spent some time..

307
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:49,470
- We wanted to say good-bye.
- Say good-bye to her and or..

308
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,709
- to him I think
- He had a...

309
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,653
- had long life that was good and..
- What's the hot plate for?

310
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,170
- The hot plate..
- The hot plate is.. because..

311
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,618
- our friend was a..
- He was a chef.

312
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:02,814
- a chef
- of small..

313
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:04,052
- who puts small..
- plates of ...

314
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:06,406
- many small items on hot plate.
- Of course, he just heated it up.

315
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:09,496
And we thought maybe if he saw or
he's near to hot plate one more time...

316
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,486
Right, right, right.
Look, I respect the act.

317
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:14,624
I'll give you guys the same
deal like I gave every else.

318
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:17,805
15 bucks get you 10 minutes
alone with the bodies.

319
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,999
- What?
- What're you talking about?

320
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:25,076
I must say thought, I've never seen a guy and
a girl bang one of these taste at the same time.

321
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:26,973
- Are you kidding me, guy?
- Ok.

322
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:30,389
- You've got the wrong idea. That's really gross.
- Wow, you got a wrong idea about us.

323
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,762
- We were gonna have, we were just gonna come and have a bite a bit, I mean..
- I don't..

324
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,590
Wait, I don't judge you guys. It's cool.

325
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,038
- I like yogurt up my ass and a popsicle
stick in my mouth, that's all.
- Oh my god, man.

326
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,754
- You know what? Let's just give this guy 15 bucks.
- I don't even know what to say.

327
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:42,063
What up, man?
You're the one with the hot plate.

328
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:43,667
- No, that is... much worse.
- Weirdo.

329
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:47,721
Ok, I'm a weirdo, says the guy,
who yogurt up his ass.

330
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:52,809
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

331
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,868
These are dead bodies.

332
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,116
two dead, two dead guys.

333
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:57,069
It's the real deal here.

334
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:00,585
I don't think I can eat this guy.

335
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,645
No, I don't think I can, right?
What is that?

336
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:04,275
I don't, I don't know.

337
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,729
- It's not because he's black, though, right?
- What?

338
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:10,841
- Ok, I..
- No! What, no! I still think so, no!

339
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,743
- It's because he's dead, right?
- It's because he's dead, that's why not.

340
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,074
Good, good, good.

341
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:18,984
Now, I got a question for you.

342
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:22,600
We're racist if we don't eat this guy?

343
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,338
Oh, shit, Charlie.
Now it is.

344
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,049
I'm sorry, Dee. I just thought white guy over
here looks better than him for some reason.

345
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,263
He looks so much better,
doesn't he? What is that?

346
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:32,085
I don't know, you know what it is?
I generally, I don't eat dark meat.

347
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,324
No, I've preferred the
white meat. I always have.

348
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:35,867
- Yeah, so it's not that guy.
- No, it has nothing to do with that.

349
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:39,776
The problem is I'm gonna have a really
hard time for both cannibals and racist.

350
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,587
- We're not, Dee.
- I wanna just make sure.

351
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,470
Cannibalism? Racism, Dee?
That's not for us.

352
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,416
You know, those are the decisions that're
best left to the suits on Washington.

353
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,530
Ok? We're just here to eat some dude.

354
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,035
Well, I'm, you lost me with Washington, but the rest
I agree with, so let's eat a piece of this white guy.

355
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:54,245
Let's get him.

356
00:13:58,423 --> 00:13:59,353
I don't think I can do it.

357
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,757
- No, me neither.
- No.

358
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:04,853
Hey, the good news is that
means we're not racist.

359
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,593
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Ok, ok, ok.

360
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:11,430
I made it.

361
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,034
I'm fastest,

362
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:15,117
I finished this lane.

363
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,796
I beat you, bitches.

364
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,371
Hey, shreep rat.

365
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:32,665
- Don't move!
- Hey, hey, hey!

366
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,256
I'm not here to kill you.

367
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,894
I'm here to help you turn
the tables on Mac and Dennis.

368
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:39,914
What do you mean?

369
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:43,406
I wanna show those bastards today,
it ain't ok to hunt humans.

370
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:44,417
Yeah?

371
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,712
They drew first blood, not you.

372
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:47,813
They what?

373
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:51,594
They drew first blood!

374
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:54,611
What is that?
Is that a...

375
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,072
Is that Rambo?

376
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:58,539
- No, I made that up.
- No, no, no.

377
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,761
- That's Rambo.
- You want me to help you or not?

378
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,021
Yes, yes.

379
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:03,627
Well, come on. Let's go.

380
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,025
Get up.

381
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,291
Tag!
You're it!

382
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:17,046
Holy shit!

383
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:20,125
Holy shit, dude.
Holy shit!

384
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,005
Tag, you're it? And a knife?
What the hell is this, man?

385
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,005
Why are you laughing?

386
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,284
Stop laughing, dude.
This is serious shit!

387
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,481
- Yeah? Huh?
- What?

388
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,224
Oh my god. Are you kidding me?
You gorilla masked me?

389
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:32,488
Yes! Bro, you gotta admit. I had so
much more awesome than tea-bagging.

390
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,162
Oh, yeah? Take a look at
your mouth, you tell me.

391
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,862
You put your balls in my
mouth while I was sleeping?

392
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:39,458
- Yeah, man, twice.
- That's rape.

393
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,933
- Yeah, I know.
- That is borderline rape.

394
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,273
Yeah, bro, you got a lot of people care.
- Not anymore.

395
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,474
Yeah, I guess not.

396
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,638
Jesus, man. What's with the note?
I mean what's with the our tricks.

397
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,273
No, I didn't leave it.
I thought you left it.

398
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:49,295
So it was Cricket.

399
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,020
Oh, shit!

400
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,972
Ok, Cricket got to us.
He got to us.

401
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:53,784
Oh, damn! He got to us, Dennis.

402
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:57,463
Ok, the good news is the gorilla mask,
the purple tea-bag both totally viable options, right?

403
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:58,912
Ok, the bad news is..

404
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:00,221
it looks like Cricket finally snapped.

405
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:02,719
We may have pushed him to far, Dennis.
What do you think he's gonna do?

406
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,076
We need to get to him first.

407
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,599
We need to set a trap.

408
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,499
Yeah.

409
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,537
Then how do you catch a cricket?

410
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,096
With a giant bird.

411
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:15,527
Dee, would you calm down? You're eating that cheese
steak like a some kind of giant bird, you know?

412
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:16,771
I can't help it, Charlie.

413
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:19,500
- You know, I got an insatiable hunger.
- Oh, I know what that hunger is, you know?

414
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,207
- Stop telling me about the hunger, Ok?
I'm feeling a good.
- Is it?

415
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,050
Now, let's just go back to
the morgue, ok?. This is shit.

416
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,252
No, that place is terrible.

417
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:26,551
- Oh, none of those were terrible.
- Don't think about that.

418
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,154
Look, Dee.
We're cannibals now.

419
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,925
- although it's pretty obvious to me.
- I started to look that, but isn't it?

420
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,744
That's a fact, Dee.
That's what it is.

421
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:33,629
Look, if we don't feed the
hunger, we can die for that.

422
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:34,584
It's not our fault.
It's nature.

423
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,865
That's nature! That's what happens,
people die from the hunger.

424
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,563
Oh my god. All the time that happens.

425
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:39,543
We don't want that to happen.

426
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:41,619
Oh my god, that happened to me.
It won't happen to you?

427
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,611
No, I want it happen to me, but
I'm not going back to that morgue.

428
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,940
Oh, we gotta do something about it.

429
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,439
Oh, Charlie, oh, I wanted
to eat that lady so bad.

430
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,271
I did, too. I did, too.

431
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:50,374
- We're gonna have to do it.
- No, no!

432
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,413
- We're gonna have to find a living human being.
- No, no, you know why? I'll tell you why.

433
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,301
Because it's dead meat,
and dead meat is bad meat.

434
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:56,155
No, not the morgue.
I'm with you on this.

435
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:57,388
on this thing.

436
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:59,843
- I never wanted that before, I wanna know.
- I know, but I wanna know.

437
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:02,108
We gotta find a guy.
We gotta kill that guy, and we gotta eat it.

438
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,496
Somebody, little rotten maybe.

439
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:08,165
- Somebody..
- that nobody will start asking questions about, if he's missing.

440
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,725
- I mean, when we do that, we don't want any gushers.
- I don't wanna get caught.

441
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,445
- Someone no in the world could ever care about.
- Small change?

442
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:15,362
Hungry
Please help.

443
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:19,780
Aho.

444
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,543
I can't do this.
They're not coming off, seriously.

445
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,581
Oh, no, they're not going to.

446
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,266
I used airplane glue, bro.
That's gonna be your look for a while.

447
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,528
Now, run me through how
we're gonna do this with Dee.

448
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,028
I'll talk her to it. Don't.

449
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:33,825
Dee, ah, great. We need to
use you as bait for our Cricket.

450
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:34,621
Screw up.

451
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:38,716
- What in the hell is going on here?
- Who is this?

452
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:40,577
- No, no, we don't wanna know his name.
- Go away!

453
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:43,389
No, wait, wait, Dee.
What? Oh my god no.

454
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,364
- What are we doing?
- What?

455
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,596
You know what kid?
You gotta get out of here, man.

456
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,477
You gotta get out of here.
It's not safe here.

457
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:50,328
- We can't do this.
- No. Charlie, listen to me, listen to me good.

458
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,454
If we don't eat this kid,
we're gonna die. You know it.

459
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,349
Oh my god, I wanna eat him
as much as you wanna eat him,

460
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,995
- but it's wrong to do it.
- No, it's a..

461
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:58,044
- It's wrong that, going back to the street!
- Damn it! Damn it!

462
00:17:58,045 --> 00:17:59,721
So, you're gonna eat that kid.

463
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,637
No, you don't know.
You don't have the hunger.

464
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:03,092
You know? We don't give
a shit about any of these.

465
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,000
Dee? Cricket trap bait? You?

466
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,233
What?

467
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,527
Hello?

468
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:08,539
- Hey, Frank.
- Hooray.

469
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,168
Speaker, yeah, hold on.

470
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,209
Is Dennis with you?

471
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,141
Uh.. yeah.

472
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,257
Good, back in Dennis,

473
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:18,078
prepare to be burned alive.

474
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,591
This is the point where I
normally burn you alive, but

475
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:26,461
I just did it to prove a point
that I think I made my point.

476
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:28,550
- Hey, Frank. Hey, Frank.
- Hey, man.

477
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:30,679
- Hey, Franky.
- Good to see you.

478
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,684
Good to see you, man.
Hey, look.

479
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:35,006
- Can you get us more like human meat?
- Bodies, please.

480
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,005
Are you still going on about the meat?

481
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,713
I didn't feed you human meat.

482
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,525
It was a raccoon.

483
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,137
- What?
- What?

484
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,304
You ate raccoon meat.

485
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:47,759
I told you it was people,
because I wanted to freak you out,

486
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,545
because you're stealing my food.

487
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,922
- No! No, no
- No, no.

488
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:55,157
Then why am I always hungry? And stomach pains?
And nothing satisfies the hunger?

489
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:57,097
You probably got a tapeworm.

490
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:59,483
Raccoon meat is lousy with parasites.

491
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:01,766
Ok, are we done here?

492
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,259
Because we're bored of shit.

493
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,949
No, no, no, no, no. Not yet.

494
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:08,658
Get ready, for a mouthful--

495
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:13,228
of strawberry blond
haired, covered balls.

496
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:15,709
- Frank? Grab 'em
- We're not doing that.

497
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,633
What do you mean?
What do you mean we're not doing it.

498
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,895
- I lied.
- What?

499
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,429
What, what is it with you people?

500
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:23,534
I mean, you guys are always
touching each other's nipples,

501
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:25,768
putting your balls in
each other's mouths.

502
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,560
- Yeah, it's fun.
- It's funny.

503
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,808
I just don't understand your generation.

504
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:35,740
Raccoon meat!

505
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,784
- Ball shit!
- What?

506
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:39,299
That was human meat, I know it.

507
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,248
Look, I don't give you
a shit what you think.

508
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:41,987
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

509
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:45,981
I gotta chop off that pieces of that
fellow calf muscle of yours, Frank.

510
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,369
And I'm gonna eat it.

511
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,174
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Charlie.
- We're gonna put it on the hot plate, right?

512
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,577
- Get him!
- Oh, you can't run way from me!

513
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:57,322
- Well, I guess the hunt is all once bagan.
- Indeed, it is.

514
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,586
- Oh, they're gonna have so much fun, man.
- Oh, those two are gonna have blast, huh?

515
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,726
So, I guess the only thing that's left is
to figure out what to do with Mr. Cricket.

516
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:09,346
Yeah, oh.
What to do, what to do.

517
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:11,193
Guess it's just us.

518
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:14,753
It's just you and us, and a..

519
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:19,788
couple pairs of sour sweaty balls.

520
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,188
