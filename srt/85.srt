1
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:04,149
SWEET DEE: I cannot believe how
bad it's gotten back here.

2
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:06,183
DENNIS: We should have
gone in the front.

3
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,183
MAC: The front's worse.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,616
Oh, God, it stinks so bad!

5
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:11,288
I can't believe the trashmen can strike
in this economy. It's unbelievable.

6
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:12,555
It should be against the law.

7
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,090
Is all of this our trash?

8
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,192
We generate a ton of it.

9
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:17,197
It's a sad throwaway
culture we're living in.

10
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,199
Mm, it's true.

11
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:22,802
I feel like you guys have done
something like that before?

12
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,871
Have we?

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,440
Shut up, bird.

14
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,674
(Dennis laughs)

15
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:28,442
It's just not that funny.

16
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,609
CHARLIE: Uh, look out.

17
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:30,844
Ooh! Whoa!

18
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:33,114
What are you doing,
keeping trash in here?!

19
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,015
Take it outside.

20
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,951
There's no more room outside.

21
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:38,219
FRANK: Can you believe
these trash bozos?

22
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,722
They make $20 an hour
and they want more?

23
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,823
20 bucks an hour?

24
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:42,690
That's an outrage!

25
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,591
These guys are blasting us in the ass.

26
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,792
Yeah, I mean, we pay their
salaries, and they turn around

27
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,826
and ass-blast us? Come on.

28
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:48,960
What are you talking about?

29
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,695
You don't pay taxes.
You don't even vote.

30
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,632
Who am I supposed to vote
for, the Republican who's

31
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,768
blasting me in the ass or the Democrat
who's blasting me in the ass?

32
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,104
Yeah, politics is all
one big ass-blast.

33
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,073
This doesn't all sound
familiar to you guys?

34
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:03,910
If these jerks don't want to do
their job, I say we do it for 'em.

35
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,412
The trash business is a <i>gold</i> mine.

36
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,613
Yeah, Frank's right.

37
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:11,885
Let's pull up our bootstraps,
oil up a couple asses and do

38
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:13,486
a little plowing of our own.

39
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:18,692
Pow!

40
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:19,994
Not gay sex.

41
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,195
Okay, yeah.

42
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,898
It seemed like... What
are you talking about?

43
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,000
We're gonna solve the trash crisis.

44
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:26,501
Oh!

45
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,071
All of this, I've heard
all of this before. No?

46
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,206
Shut up, bird.

47
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,741
(both laugh)

48
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:44,036
Sync & corrections by 

49
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:00,267
All right, it's a simple plan.

50
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,537
Matt, Dennis, Charlie, you rent
the van, you drive to rich

51
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:08,009
people's homes, you tell them that
you'll pick up the trash for a fee.

52
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:12,180
Then you take the trash to a dump in
New Jersey where there's no strike.

53
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:16,484
Meanwhile, I dress Dee up like
a whore, get a city official,

54
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:21,521
bribe him, and make him give us the
contract, undermining the trash unions.

55
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,623
Any questions?

56
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,958
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

57
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:25,659
Charlie.

58
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,296
We've gone to door-to-door in a van
before, and that didn't work out for us.

59
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:30,497
This is gonna work, trust me.

60
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,398
Mac?

61
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:34,368
I think it's gonna be hard to
hang off the back of a van

62
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:35,602
like the trash guys do.

63
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,037
Can we just get a trash truck?

64
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,072
No, you don't want to
be caught scabbing.

65
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:40,207
Get a van. Dennis?

66
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:43,377
I don't want to be a trashman.

67
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,612
I'll bribe the city official with you.

68
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:47,280
I need a lady whore. Dee?

69
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,015
Yeah, I've done the whore thing before.

70
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,183
I don't care for it.

71
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:51,384
I won't be doing it again.

72
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,319
The whore thing worked.

73
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:53,487
You just didn't listen to me.

74
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,622
How many times have we done
this kind of thing before?

75
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,024
A lot.
We've done things.

76
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,160
We've done stuff like
this all the time.

77
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:00,128
Yeah, once or twice.

78
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,597
And how often do they work out?

79
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,998
Well, come on.

80
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,166
It doesn't always work out.

81
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,701
How often <i>should</i> it work out?

82
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,569
Almost never.

83
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:09,638
That's because you don't listen to me.

84
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:14,310
This time we do it <i>my</i> way.

85
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,687
Okay, I'm a little confused.

86
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:27,356
So, Frank is the brains and
you're just the looks now?

87
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:29,726
And I'm still the wild
card, so that's good.

88
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,095
No, no, guys, we're forsaking
the group dynamic, okay?

89
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,097
And truthfully, Charlie, come on.

90
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,233
I mean, (sighs) nobody
wants a wild card, okay?

91
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:37,467
It doesn't make any sense.

92
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,736
We don't want a maniac in our group.

93
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,205
There's no benefit to it.

94
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:41,638
Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:45,576
Uh, I feel like you just agreed
with me, but you weren't

96
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,244
listening to what I was saying.

97
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:49,113
Yes.

98
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:53,384
You pointed at me like I said
something, but I didn't.

99
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:55,286
Oh, good.

100
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:58,122
Charlie, having somebody making
wild decisions that make

101
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:59,690
no sense, that benefits nobody.

102
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,559
Oh, yes.

103
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:02,927
Right, yes.

104
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,162
Is he listening to us?

105
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,029
I can't tell.

106
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:05,964
He's listening.

107
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:06,631
He's not understanding.

108
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,201
Yeah, he doesn't even like, get us, man.
It's... We're talking about you.

109
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,135
Oh.

110
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,237
Okay, let's move on from it.

111
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:14,039
What do you think is
happening right now?

112
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,006
Guys, it doesn't matter.

113
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:15,674
It's good.

114
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:16,675
We'll sort this out later.

115
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:19,144
It doesn't matter, guys, because
I have no love for this plan.

116
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:21,046
I just don't want to be a trashman.

117
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,983
Yeah, and guys, if I'm being
honest, there's no way that I

118
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:26,252
can hang off one of the back
of these, just simply no way.

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,987
Yeah, what would you hang onto?

120
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:29,088
Let's bail on plan.

121
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:29,956
Let's bail on it.

122
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:30,690
I don't want to do it.

123
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,692
Wait, wait, but that's
the whole thing, right?

124
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:33,727
We can't just quit.

125
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:35,996
Like, we have to see Frank's
plan all the way through.

126
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,164
That's what he wants us to do.

127
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,199
Okay, all right, fine.

128
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,366
We'll do Frank's plan.

129
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:44,605
But I think I have a tweak that is
gonna solve both of our problems.

130
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,177
This is what I'm talking
about, Charlie.

131
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,045
Oh, yeah.

132
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:53,581
See, we're still doing Frank's
plan; we're just improving on it.

133
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,449
Yeah, we... absolutely.

134
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:55,383
Look, the man's got good plans.

135
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,118
It's the specifics are outdated.

136
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:58,019
They're old... You know?

137
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:58,920
They're very outdated.

138
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:01,322
Yeah, sure, in the 1950s, yeah,
you could drive around door to

139
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,125
door in a windowless van, and people
didn't think they were gonna get raped.

140
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:05,026
Now, th-they will think that.

141
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:05,694
Yeah.

142
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:06,561
This is better.

143
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,496
I know, and plus with the
tuxedos, you know, honestly, who

144
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,398
wouldn't want their
trashman in a tuxedo?

145
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,266
Absolutely.

146
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:12,133
I know I would.

147
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:14,068
There's plenty of room in
the back for the trash.

148
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,037
You know, the real trashmen
don't know we're scabbing.

149
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:16,705
Good plan.

150
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:17,672
It's a good plan.

151
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:21,276
Wonder how Max is doing back there.

152
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,115
I can't believe you never listen to me.

153
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,417
You're supposed to look like a whore.

154
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:32,087
The whore-politician
is outdated, Frank.

155
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,389
That is an idea that's
best left in the trash.

156
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,524
I am presenting myself
as a powerful lady.

157
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,627
You're presenting yourself as a banana.

158
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,629
Okay, you know what, I'm here
and I'm doing your plan.

159
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:41,630
I'm just doing it my way.

160
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,599
Well, at least sex it up a little bit.
Open some buttons.

161
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:44,566
I don't want to. Stop it.

162
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,434
Get off me!

163
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:46,335
Show some skin.

164
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,202
Stop it, Frank!

165
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:48,503
St... Oh, great!

166
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:50,339
This is nice. This doesn't
look powerful or sexy.

167
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:51,273
Now it looks good.

168
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:52,141
Great job, Frank!

169
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,142
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

170
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,609
I'm running a little bit late.

171
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,679
Now, I understand that you guys
wanted to get a bid to undermine

172
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:02,683
the waste manag... I know you guys.

173
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,218
Oh, shit.

174
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,252
This ain't gonna work.

175
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:06,153
You know this guy?

176
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,221
It's the gay guy who
wanted to buy Paddy's.

177
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,057
Oh, yeah, you fired me
from the Oldies Rock Café.

178
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:15,195
Huh, I did not picture this guy
getting recycled back into the mix.

179
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:17,064
So much for the sex appeal angle.

180
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,366
I don't know, Frank, why don't
you sex it up a little?

181
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:20,267
What do you mean? Get off.

182
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,402
Get off of me, get off of me.

183
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,302
Why don't you sex it?

184
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,236
How about you be the whore?

185
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,171
How about you be the whore, huh?

186
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,038
Get off me.

187
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:26,707
Why don't you show some skin?

188
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,442
Please... Stop it.

189
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,310
Get off of me.

190
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,211
Huh? He likes it like that.

191
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,078
Stop it.

192
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:31,979
Oh, do it, show some skin.

193
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,647
Knock it off, you lousy bitch.

194
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:34,515
Stop it!

195
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,516
(panting)

196
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,117
What are you doing?

197
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:39,520
Uh... you like what you see?

198
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:41,154
Hmm?

199
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:42,389
♪ I still got the moves... ♪

200
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:47,428
(humming)

201
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:47,962
Okay.

202
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,663
Now, guys, we've done something
like this before, so we should

203
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:51,131
be able to do it better
this time around.

204
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,665
Right.

205
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:53,734
Now, right off the bat, Charlie, were you
planning on doing an accent of any kind?

206
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:54,468
Yes.

207
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:55,135
Me, too.

208
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:56,436
You guys were both
planning on doing accents.

209
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:57,904
Yeah.
Of course.

210
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,606
Let's not do accents. That's the kind of wild-card
stuff that always gets us into trouble.

211
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:01,474
All right, you know what?

212
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:03,309
Let's put all of our
cards on the table.

213
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:05,111
Were you guys planning anything else?

214
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:06,646
I have a knife.
Why do you have a knife?

215
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:08,381
Uh, to make sure that the plan works.

216
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,248
Could be good.

217
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,249
Okay. The plan's gonna work.

218
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,116
Give me the knife.

219
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:11,983
All right.

220
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,518
Should I have the knife?
I should have the knife.

221
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,287
Somebody should... have the knife.

222
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:18,156
I'm afraid that if I don't have the knife,
then one of you will stab somebody.

223
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:20,025
And again, that's a wild card
thing; we don't want that.

224
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:20,692
Right.

225
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:22,594
That's what we're trying
to get rid of, right?

226
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:23,462
Right.

227
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,430
We <i>don't</i> want that.

228
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:26,231
Right, right, right, right...
Right, exactly.

229
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,001
So why don't... and also, why don't
you guys let me do the talking?

230
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:29,634
Well, hold... hang on.

231
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,603
You know, 'cause now you're...
look, you've done talking

232
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,171
before, and that hasn't always worked.

233
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,106
It hasn't worked because you
guys are always interrupting me.

234
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:35,707
We were always what?

235
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,041
I'll talk!
I'll talk.

236
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,676
Mac, you have an exceptional
number of bugs in your teeth.

237
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,545
You're gonna want to rinse
those out; it's disgusting.

238
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:41,078
Bugs?

239
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:41,512
Yes, bugs.

240
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:42,146
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:42,947
Is that what that is?

242
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:43,448
Yeah.

243
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:45,216
If you're going to ride back there,
ride with your mouth shut, man.

244
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:45,983
All right, listen.

245
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:51,289
I think I have a tweak where...
none of us does the talking.

246
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:52,290

Damn it, Dennis.

263
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:14,211
I knew this wasn't gonna work.

264
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,212
No, the plan was good.

265
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,213
Charlie, you were sharp.

266
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,082
I was... You were a little sharp.

267
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,083
Guys, guys, the song was fine.

268
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:22,152
Did you say you would take my trash?

269
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,153
Yeah.

270
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:26,122
Yeah, that's... (laughs) Oh, my...
How much will it cost?

271
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:31,961
Oh, we didn't, um... $200...
Oh, that's fantastic.

272
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,696
Can we start now?

273
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,030
Yeah!

274
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,031
Yeah, sure.

275
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,067
One more time with the song?

276
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,068
No thank you. Just the trash.

277
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,069
I knew I wasn't sharp.

278
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:40,969
Let's go.

279
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,639
All right, let's do it, boys.

280
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,303
So how does this place
tickle your fancy?

281
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:56,856
Why are we here?

282
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:59,491
Because you are a power bottom.

283
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,492
He's a what?

284
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:01,493
A power bottom.

285
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,562
I'm not having this conversation.

286
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,663
What do you want?

287
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:07,199
We can pick up the trash for
half the price of the union.

288
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:08,267
We want city contract.

289
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:11,571
Look, there's no way you're going to
undermine one of the biggest unions

290
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,572
in the city.

291
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:15,842
Moreover, both sides are incredibly
close to an agreement. So...

292
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,977
Well, you see anything you like here?

293
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,346
Maybe we can hook it up
and change your mind.

294
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:21,814
May I please leave?

295
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:22,915
I don't get it.

296
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,684
We take you to a titty bar
and you say no to us.

297
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:29,554
We bring you to this place with all these
juicy dongs, and you shut us down.

298
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,422
What team are you playing for?

299
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:32,857
Hold on a second, Frank.

300
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:34,859
I think I know what's going on here.

301
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:36,694
This man has been realigned.

302
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,396
He's a yestergay.

303
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,532
What's a yestergay?

304
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,235
A lot of men bounce around from
label to label never quite

305
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,370
finding their proper gay home.

306
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:50,376
My hunch is that this gentleman has gone
from a twink to a twunk to a twank.

307
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:51,411
What's a twunk?

308
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,579
Twink and a hunk.

309
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:54,848
A twink with muscles,
but still hairless.

310
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,449
So smooth.

311
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:57,583
Oh, incredibly smooth.

312
00:09:57,652 --> 00:09:59,018
A twank on the other hand.

313
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:00,319
Twank is no good.

314
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:01,454
That's a twink and a skank.

315
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:04,257
Essentially a ragdoll, just
being passed around from twink

316
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:05,291
to twunk to bear to otter.

317
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

318
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,427
What's an otter?

319
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:09,628
Subsection of bear.

320
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:13,599
Still hairy, but where a bear generates
his power through sheer mass alone,

321
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,401
the otter generates his power
through extraordinary quickness,

322
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,570
cunning, and skill.

323
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,307
That is a lot to keep in your
head to maintain a lifestyle.

324
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:24,444
It's very difficult to maintain the
lifestyle of a twank versatile 'cause this

325
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:27,581
this often leads to a lot
of self-hatred and denial,

326
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,616
especially among the religious
or political types.

327
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:32,954
So they try and realign their
sexual orientation through therapy.

328
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,055
So he's not gay anymore?

329
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:36,324
Well, that's a hotly
debated topic, isn't it?

330
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,359
I, for one, am of the belief
that some things can't be thrown

331
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,360
in the trash, Frank.

332
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,696
And your sexuality is one of them.

333
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:42,864
I totally agree.

334
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:44,699
Some cocks can't be unsucked.

335
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,068
So is it a case of forgetting,
or is it denying?

336
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:48,536
Neither.

337
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,504
Still gay.

338
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,005
You still here?

339
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,807
I thought you'd be gone by now.

340
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,242
I can't.

341
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:56,811
You're pointing a gun at me.

342
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,312
Oh, I forgot.

343
00:10:58,381 --> 00:10:59,680
(uncocks gun)

344
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:02,384
Well, I guess we'll be
the ones to slink away.

345
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,419
Dee...

346
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,887
(all laugh)

347
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:42,489
Whoo! All right.

348
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:43,891
Are you guys having fun?

349
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,892
Yeah! This is my dream.

350
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,628
Are you guys loving this or what?

351
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:48,629
Great, because I'm not.

352
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:49,630
Me neither.

353
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:50,564
Yeah, I'm not loving it.

354
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,567
You know, I used to love trash, but this
is just not how I wanted this to go.

355
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:54,568
No, not at all.

356
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:56,570
Look, yes, we're making lots
of money, and that's great,

357
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,874
but our tuxes are ruined and our limousine
is covered in trash and seagulls.

358
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:01,309
(gull caws)

359
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,345
The gulls are shitting all over me.

360
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:05,247
Oh, look, we've essentially
become garbagemen.

361
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,715
That's what I was trying to avoid.

362
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:08,250
Guys, can I make a suggestion?

363
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,818
Hmm?

364
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,855
I don't want to do Frank's plan anymore,
so I say we just quit right now.

365
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:12,856
Let's quit it.

366
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:15,459
Yeah, but I still have a
lot of energy... Me too.

367
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,027
...and I would like to
take one of our old plans

368
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:18,695
out of the trash and recycle it.

369
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,564
You want to sell gas door-to-door?

370
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:21,832
I've been thinking it the entire time.

371
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:22,800
That's what I was thinking.

372
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,567
Are you kidding me?

373
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:24,869
I've totally been thinking about that.

374
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:26,738
See, 'cause we're like...
Ya, ta, ta, ta ta!

375
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:28,873
Our friendship is like... It's strong.

376
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:29,908
We'd never blow that up.

377
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:30,808
That can't be trashed.

378
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:31,609
Never throw that out.

379
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:33,911
Guys, that gas idea was a great idea,
and it was trashed long before

380
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,812
it should've been trashed.

381
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,680
Yeah, I have one more suggestion.

382
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:37,648
Yeah?

383
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:40,384
Instead of taking that all the way to New Jersey...
let's just dump it in

384
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,820
a poor neighborhood because they don't
mind living in their own filth.

385
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:43,554
Absolutely.

386
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:44,522
They don't know any better.

387
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,691
I mean, why else would they
choose to live like that?

388
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,792
They don't care?

389
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,993
They clearly don't care.

390
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,361
Let's do it.

391
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,996

we're going back to work.

(cheers)

403
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:18,423
The new contract is being
finalized as we speak.

404
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:21,994
Now, of course, we had to
make a few compromises.

405
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:25,531
FRANK: What kind of compromises?

406
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,473
Um, well, there were certain
issues that we had to deal with.

407
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,308
Issues? Certain?

408

Give me that.

409
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,414
Brothers, I don't know about
you, but I can't understand

00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:41,682
this college boy's language.

Am I right?

412
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,755
We gotta have it in plain English.

413
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:50,425
Okay, sir, I was just getting to that.

414
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:51,592
He was just getting to that.

415
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:56,431
He's trying to confuse us with his fancy
language and his expensive podiums,

416
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,000
but we know the truth.

418
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,405
Look, just let me finish.

419
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,773
This contract is bullshit.

420
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,008
We gotta keep the strike going.

421
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:09,779
MAN: Would you please just
let him finish his sentence?

422
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:10,847
But he's lying to us.

423
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:13,249
But he hasn't said anything yet.

424
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,385
Yeah, well, he's lying anyway.

Let me ask you something.

441
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:57,394
Why we got to be the trashmen and
the maids and the gardeners, hmm?

Look, it would've been fine if
Dee hadn't incited a race war.

486
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,679
How was I supposed to
know it was you guys?

487
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,881
We were going back to
the old gas plan, okay?

488
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,815
Why?

489
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,217
Why don't you do my plan?

490
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,752
Why couldn't you guys just
grease that city council guy?

491
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:48,687
I mean, so what if he's gay, you know?

492
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:49,622
He zigs, you zag.

493
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,656
I would've gotten the contract.

494
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,958
Can we just forget about
the whole thing, please?

495
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:53,892
Let's just forget about it.

496
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:55,294
Can I get a beer?
Yeah, I'm on it.

497
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,063
I don't want to talk about it either.

498
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:57,964
Let me have a beer.

499
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:58,664
Yeah.

500
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,565
Yeah, beer me, beer me.

501
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,534
Yes, beers!

502
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:03,536
(Dennis sighs)

503
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:05,537
♪ ♪

504
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,047
(Frank grunting)

505
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:21,687
We should get rugs for the bar.

506
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:23,688
We should make rugs for the bar.

507
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:24,556
Make them?

508
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,657
I got a rug guy.

509
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,993
We could put on a show where
we play rug salesmen.

510
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:28,994
That's a good idea.

511
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:30,729
That would attract a great
amount of attention.

512
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:31,796
No, no way.

513
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,732
What, no, what?!

514
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,100
Guys, we give up way too easily.

515
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,570
Let me just jump onto the next thing?

516
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:38,771
What? That's insane.

517
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,707
Look, all we have to do is make
a couple adjustments, and this

518
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:42,708
plan can still work.

519
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:44,810
Dennis, if you want to be classy
and you're g-good with city

520
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:46,612
councilmen and you think
you can get him, great.

521
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:47,547
Be classy and bang the guy.

522
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,214
Go get him.

523
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,116
I'll get him, but I'm
not going to bang him.

524
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:51,017
He's a twink versatile.

525
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:51,884
You watch yourself.

526
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,720
Ooh, I wouldn't be able to satisfy him.

527
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:54,587
A twink versatile?

528
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,254
That's impressive.

529
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:58,191
Look, the point is, we got to
learn from our mistakes, right?

530
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,561
You know, make a couple adjustments.

531
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:06,198
Let's solve this trash crisis.

532
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:09,068
(tires screeching)

533
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:11,104
Okay, when we arrive, Dennis
will do all of the talking,

534
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,974
Frank and I will handle the refuse,
and Dee will take the wheel.

535
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,109
Then we can strap me onto the
back for the rest of the day.

536
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:16,977
Everybody's happy.

537
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:19,780
Yeah, guys, I can't believe it, but
I think this might actually work.

538
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,917
See, all we had to do was learn from
our mistakes and then work together.

539
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,820
Everyone got to contribute
something to the group as a whole.

540
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:26,821
What did you contribute?

541
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,755
Try the brakes.

542
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,558
Try the... Did you cut
the brakes again?

543
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:30,559
Yep.

544
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:31,226
Oh, Charlie.

545
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,094
Why would you do that, Charlie?

546
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:34,195
That's just what I do.

547
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:35,163
Wild card, bitches!

548
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,164
What?

549
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,698
Yee-ha!

550
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:38,799
(Dennis and Sweet Dee screaming)

551
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,734
Oh, my... We have no brakes.

552
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:41,735
Oh, God!

553
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,104
Oh, my God!

554
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:45,639
What are you doing, what...?

555
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,640
That's that.

556
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,542
Whew, good call of getting
those brakes fixed, Mac.

557
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,143
Yeah, I saw that coming a mile away.

558
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,612
All right, now that we got
rid of our wild card, we can

559
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,214
actually see this thing through.

560
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:55,215
So, we good?

561
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,017
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be easy money.

562
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:57,917
Grab some trash, you bitches.

563
00:18:57,986 --> 00:18:58,785
(Dennis laughs)

564
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:00,586
I'm telling you, this
is gonna be great.

565
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,522
I feel like this is
gonna work, I think.

566
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,859
(vehicle approaches, horn honks)

567
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,865
Guess the strike's over.

568
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:13,554
Goddamn it.

569
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:16,201
So, the rugs?

570
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:18,077
Yeah, the rugs.

571
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:18,944
Well, yeah, the rugs.

572
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,019
Yeah, it's always been the rugs.

573
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:21,265
Rugs are a great idea.
Of course it's rugs.

574
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:21,988
It's always been the rugs.

575
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,197
We should get a billboard.
