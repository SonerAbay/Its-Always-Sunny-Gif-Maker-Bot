1
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,893
Goddamn it.

2
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:11,374
Come on, get in there!

3
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:12,767
Charlie, what are you doing, man?
What are you...

4
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:14,116
- What's going on over here?
- Oh, I'm trying to get

5
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:15,552
each of my toes

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,727
in these five-fingered shoes,
you know what I mean?

7
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,163
But there's, like,
something's dropping off

8
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:19,730
and I can't tell where my pinky is.

9
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:21,340
Why did you get the
stupid five-finger shoes?

10
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,821
Well, you're always yelling at me
for taking my shoes off in laser tag,

11
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,170
so I figured I'd get some shoes

12
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,868
that are like...
a lot more like bare feet.

13
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,391
- I don't know why you're always yelling at me about...
- Well, I'm always

14
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,219
yelling at you because when
you're taking your shoes off,

15
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:31,394
you're not holding your gun.

16
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:33,091
And also, you know,
the cheese you've eaten,

17
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,790
it-it's always oozing out of your feet
and it's an awful smell.

18
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,661
That's the cheese I hide in my shoes,

19
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:38,923
- that's where it is.
- Okay, well... What?

20
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:40,708
I can't even, like,
fit cheese in these shoes.

21
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:43,014
- These things suck.
- Just guard the base, man.

22
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,755
Kind of sick and tired
of guarding the base.

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,278
What if we go out there, run around?

24
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,715
I want to go out there
and have some fun, man.

25
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,978
We gotta guard the base.
That's what we always do,

26
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,284
and that's what we figured
out works a long time ago.

27
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:53,808
Plus, we're-we're waiting for Big Mo.

28
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,768
- Waiting for who?
- We're waiting for Big Mo, man.

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,509
The-the hotshot kid and his crew

30
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,858
that are climbing up the leaderboard.

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,294
Yeah, he's gonna be gunning for our base

32
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:03,861
and we need to protect it.

33
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:04,993
Ah, who gives a shit, man?
There's always

34
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,908
some hotshot kid gunning for our base.

35
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:07,996
Look, Charlie.

36
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,780
How long we been playing laser tag?

37
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,217
- A long time.
- A long time, baby. Yeah.

38
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,828
Some people might think that's sad,
but that's not sad.

39
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:15,481
- I think... I think it's awesome.
- That's not sad, that's cool.

40
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,396
I think the longer you're
in the game, the better,

41
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:18,658
- you know what I mean?
- Yes, yeah, no, definitely.

42
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:20,530
Look. We're the best,
we're-we're awesome,

43
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,750
but, um, I'm-I'm done. I'm moving on.

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,403
- I'm...
- No, no, no, no, no! No, stop. Stay.

45
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:26,014
We're playing the game
the way we always play it,

46
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:27,115
and we're...

47
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,669
waiting for Big Mo.

48
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,892
_

49
00:01:58,865 --> 00:01:59,917
All right.

50
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:01,527
Everything's going to plan out there.

51
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,702
Yeah, but it does sound like

52
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:03,878
people are out there having fun,
you know?

53
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:05,606
- What's with you today, man?
- I don't know.

54
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,676
I'm bored.
I want to do something different.

55
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,883
What about, uh,
what if we do some riddles?

56
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:10,014
- Riddles?
- Yeah.

57
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,494
Frank and I have been
doing a lot of riddles

58
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,104
to kill the time, you know what I mean?

59
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:15,324
It's... I think we'll have a little
bit more fun that way.

60
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:16,834
No. I'm just gonna guard the base.

61
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:17,935
Yeah, I know, but here it comes.

62
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,068
Why do blind people hate skydiving?

63
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,939
I don't even understand
how that's a riddle.

64
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,941
Well, 'cause it's
a-a very hard one, okay?

65
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:25,987
- So try... take a guess.
- I don't know. Why?

66
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:28,772
'Cause it scares the
hell out of their dogs.

67
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:30,439
That's not a riddle.

68
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,080
Yeah, it's a riddle about blind people,
you know?

69
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,777
- No.
- And-and their dogs, I guess.

70
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:34,996
No, what you've told me is a joke.

71
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,736
No. Jokes are funny
and that wasn't funny.

72
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,999
I didn't say it was funny.

73
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,130
Then how is it a joke, Dennis?

74
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,650
Um... Okay, you know what? Yeah.

75
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:41,959
No, that was a mind-bending riddle.

76
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,134
- Wow.
- It's a tough one, 'cause you don't think...

77
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:44,744
- Warning.
- Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

78
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,096
Listen.

79
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:47,486
That could be Big Mo. Get ready.

80
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,792
Get ready, here we go.

81
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:50,794
- Get off of me!
- Ah! Get off me!

82
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,927
- Stop it!
- Dennis, everything was going perfectly.

83
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,537
I was up in the air ducts,
just like you said.

84
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,104
- Oh...
- I was sniping at the red base.

85
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,149
I was at the blue base
doing the exact same thing.

86
00:02:58,193 --> 00:02:59,522
- What is...?
- I tried to crawl down the ducts

87
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,022
and pass this uncoordinated monkey.

88
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:03,432
- We go by each other...
- We got tangled up

89
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,577
and then she spit in my mouth, Dennis.

90
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:05,504
- She spit in my mouth.
- I spit in your mouth

91
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:07,811
after you jammed me in the tit
with your scrawny little elbow.

92
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,682
My elbows are massive
and you have no tits!

93
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,988
- Your elbows suck!
- Ah. Damn it!

94
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,121
Goddamn it, can you do nothing right?
This is all your fault.

95
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,341
I've been warning you
about your lack of elbow mass for weeks.

96
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:17,865
You idiot! You fool!

97
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,083
And you!

98
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,130
You're doing a great job.

99
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,001
Okay?

100
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:25,916
You are killing it out there,
and I'm so proud of you!

101
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:28,832
- Now I need you both to get back up there and...
- Wait.

102
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,051
I-I actually got an idea.

103
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:31,574
Like, what if you guys
don't play the game

104
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,141
up in the air ducts this time,

105
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,620
but you go down on the floor?

106
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:35,883
Where everyone's having all the fun?

107
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:37,058
They look like they're
having so much fun

108
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:38,059
- playing laser ta...
- Will you shut up?!

109
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,321
This isn't about having fun. Okay?

110
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,323
This is about staying alive
and winning. Okay?

111
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:42,467
And-and it's also...

112
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,456
it's also about getting these.

113
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,156
Now, Mac...

114
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,592
what are these?

115
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:50,885
Fun Zone dolla dolla bills, y'all.

116
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:52,987
Fun Zone dolla dolla bills, y'all.

117
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,771
Okay?

118
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,642
I'm trying to get that paper, son.

119
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,428
- All right?
- Win, stay alive,

120
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,908
get dat money.

121
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,388
- Feel me?
- I feel you.

122
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,129
- But those guys are having fun.
- Yeah.

123
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,435
And doing something fun out there.

124
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,871
- And that's what I want to do.
- Hey, man.

125
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:10,756
Could I talk to you for a second,
please?

126
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,094
- Yeah. What's up?
- What you doing, man?

127
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:15,487
Why-why you...
why you mucking things up?

128
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,402
I mean,
I got things down to a science, okay?

129
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,883
- Everything's working.
- Stop it. - Ah, ah, ah!

130
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,885
I know, but, like,
these guys are ready to kill each other.

131
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,974
- It's like...
- I know, but that's what I want, okay?

132
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,194
I need their aggression at a ten.

133
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,673
That's when they're most effective.

134
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:28,892
So I withhold compliments from Mac,

135
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:30,981
because that makes him
angry and subservient,

136
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,396
so he'll do what I tell him to do.

137
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,202
And I shower Dee with compliments

138
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,160
because she feels so
undeserving of compliments

139
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:37,422
that she gets angry at herself

140
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,424
and she takes that anger
out on the children.

141
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,960
- Oh.
- See?

142
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,729
Okay. It's another riddle.

143
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,833
Let me think on that one, Dennis,
'cause I don't know the answer...

144
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,649
Okay. Yeah. You think on that
for a while. I'm gonna do my thing.

145
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,104
- You stop.
- You stop.

146
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,653
Goddamn it, Mac,
you thin-elbowed little goblin.

147
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:53,264
You never cease to disappoint me
in everything you do.

148
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:54,483
Now get back up in those ducts

149
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,876
and snipe those other kids' bases.

150
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,488
And don't come down
until I tell you to. And Dee...

151
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,852
You really are killing it out there.

152
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,407
I'm so proud of you.
You're so deserving of my love.

153
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:15,096
Yeah, see?

154
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,027
We just gotta keep playing the
game the way we always have.

155
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:19,856
Yeah. Hey, is the answer
to your riddle, uh,

156
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,292
an ice cube?

157
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,035
Yeah. Yep, you got it.

158
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,167
- That was a hard one.
- Warning.

159
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,429
Pew, pew.

160
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,734
- Pew.
- Oh.

161
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:31,172
Pew, pew. Pew, pew.

162
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,261
- Pew, pew. Oh.
- What are you doing, man?

163
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,479
I'm killing it out there.

164
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,090
I haven't been hit once.

165
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,700
It's really a lot of fun.

166
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,658
But I wanted to come and
hang out with you guys.

167
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,097
Hey, hey, Charlie,
you want to do some riddles?

168
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:44,141
- No, we're not... No, that doesn't...
- Yes. Yes, I do, hit me.

169
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,621
Is a fart a ghost?

170
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:48,276
Is a fart a ghost?
Whoa, that's a hard one.

171
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,407
I don't know. What's the answer?

172
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,714
Yeah. It's the ghost of lunch. Ha-ha!

173
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:52,845
- Very good, man!
- Good riddle.

174
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:53,977
- That's a good one.
- Great.

175
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,239
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, so, off you go.

176
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,980
Hey, you know,
that's also making me realize, dude,

177
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,329
- I'm pretty hungry, man.
- Ooh.

178
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,635
- Yeah. Whoa.
- Yeah, yeah.

179
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:01,332
Get some,
get some cheese out of your shoes.

180
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,030
Yeah, you know what? I couldn't fit any,

181
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,596
'cause I got these
stupid five-finger shoes.

182
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,250
- Yeah, I don't...
- Hey, get back out there, man. - Yeah, yeah.

183
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,296
No, well, actually,
go out to the lobby really quick

184
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,298
and get me, like, some chicken wings.

185
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:11,268
- You want hot sauce on 'em?
- No.

186
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:12,648
I forbid it. Absolutely not.

187
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,519
What... Dude, what is the big deal, man?

188
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,956
- What's the big deal? Y... Uh...
- Who even cares?

189
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,697
I mean, his pack's not even on,
for crying out loud.

190
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:22,092
- Charlie.
- What'd you say?

191
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,137
- Nothing.
- It's time we told him, dude.

192
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,834
- No, it's...
- It's time.

193
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:25,976
Uh...

194
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,315
My pack's not on?

195
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,507
I... We...

196
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,797
We-we turn your pack off

197
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,669
so that when you're running
around getting shot up,

198
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:36,063
our team doesn't lose any points.

199
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,021
But my gun still makes noise.

200
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,241
Well, no...
Well, that's you doing that, bud.

201
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:41,298
No, it isn't.

202
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,373
Pew, pe...

203
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,029
Yeah. See, that's you, bud.

204
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,161
Oh, that is me.

205
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,814
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

206
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,990
So-so I'm not part of the team?

207
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,122
- Aw...
- Well, no, you...

208
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,603
No, you're a very,
v-very valuable part of the team.

209
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,596
You know? Y-You're an amazing decoy.

210
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,517
You know, you run around,
you're screaming,

211
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,305
and you-you add sort of like
a monster element to the game

212
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:04,308
that distracts and frightens
but entertains the kids,

213
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,832
and, you know, so that Mac and Dee
can shoot their bases

214
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,095
from the ducts.

215
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,618
I'm the monster of the game?

216
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,751
Well, yeah, but, like,
you're like a fun monster.

217
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,642
Yeah, like the Cookie Monster.

218
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm the Cookie Monster?

219
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,017
- Not really, you know, 'cause...
- No, well, I guess not

220
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,236
- because...
- There's no cookies.

221
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,238
Well, and also
the kids are scared of you

222
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:23,240
- and they're not really scared of him.
- No.

223
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,373
Uh, but, you know, we need you out there

224
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,245
because you're very
valuable to the formula.

225
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,161
And the formula works,
you know what I mean? Uh, you can...

226
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:34,208
I'll tell you what,
go back out there and, you know, just...

227
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,600
you can still make the sounds.

228
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,256
- This is really sad...
- No. Uh...

229
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,215
- ...and I'm gonna turn his pack on because...
- No, no, stop.

230
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:42,607
I-I got it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

231
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,218
- I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
- Yeah?

232
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,611
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.
- All right.

233
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,439
Thanks anyway, Charlie.
He's gonna do it.

234
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:55,054
Oh. Oh, that makes some good sounds.

235
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,056
- It's cool, right?
- That's really cool.

236
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,276
Oh. Ah, I'm all set.

237
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:01,060
All right.
Get out there and kick some ass, pal.

238
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:05,108
Yeah.

239
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,415
That's not cool, man.

240
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,243
- Come on, dude.
- Shut up, man. Just... shut up.

241
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,419
He just believed it.
It's... you know, it's not cool.

242
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,637
It's pretty cool.

243
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,291
I don't know.

244
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,476
Hey,
what do you think he looks like?

245
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,043
- Who?
- Big Mo.

246
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:31,377
I don't know.
Some fat little brat probably.

247
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,485
- Oh. Oh, is that a riddle?
- What?

248
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,140
What the kid looks like.
Is it, is it a riddle?

249
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,881
Charlie, do you not know
what a riddle is?

250
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,752
Yeah, sure. It's like a,
like a thing you don't know. Right?

251
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,537
No, it's not just
a thing you don't know.

252
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,147
It's like a, it's like a puzzle.

253
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,193
All right, here's a riddle. Uh...

254
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,891
"The more you have of it,
the less you see." What is it?

255
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,762
- Cantaloupes.
- What?

256
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:52,373
Cantaloupes is your answer,
because if you're

257
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,722
holding a pile of cantaloupes,

258
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,202
You're not gonna
be able to see very much.

259
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,291
- Right. No.
- You know? Especially if it goes past your face.

260
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,659
No. That's not the answer.

261
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,160
You telling me you can see
through a pile of cantaloupes?

262
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,295
That's not the answer to the riddle.

263
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,732
The answer to the riddle is... darkness.

264
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:06,343
Right? The more you have of it,
the less you see. Darkness.

265
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,127
Yeah, but how are you gonna hold
a pile of darkness? Does that...

266
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,434
My God, uh... Hold on, hold on. Wait.

267
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:11,609
- What is this?
- What's up?

268
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:12,697
W-We're dropping down the leaderboard.

269
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,221
We're in second place.

270
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:16,092
- Oh, shit.
- Mac and Dee are getting shot up like crazy.

271
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,224
- Warning.
- Hey-o!

272
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,184
- Oh, you guys, that is fun!
- What the hell

273
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,186
is going on out there?
You guys are getting lit up.

274
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,579
- Oh.
- Yeah, well, you know, what Charlie said

275
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,189
kind of made us stop and think about

276
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,715
what the whole point of this was.

277
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,279
Yeah, yeah.
And we figured the point is to

278
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:31,325
- just be happy and have fun, right?
- Yeah.

279
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,762
You know what we did?
We-we went down to the "Fun" Zone

280
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,330
instead of the "Maintenance"
Zone in the ceiling.

281
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,005
Oh...

282
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,163
The Maintenance Zone. That's awesome.

283
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,469
Oh, my God. That's such a great joke.

284
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,471
I would never...
How do you even come up with this stuff?

285
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,125
You're so worthy of my laughter.

286
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,779
You're so worthy.

287
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,172
No. No, no, she's not worthy
of your laughter. She...

288
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,784
She told the lamest joke
earlier about a blind guy

289
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:57,612
- and a dog or some shit...
- Yeah. - Hey!

290
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,004
That's not a joke, that's a riddle.

291
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,529
And don't steal my shit,
you stupid bird-faced bitch!

292
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,966
- Oh! She is a bird. She is a bird!
- Don't steal my shit, Dee!

293
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,184
- I'll blast you to pieces!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:06,534
Now we're jamming. Now we're jamming.

295
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:07,970
- Let's get back out there, Mac.
- No!

296
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,406
No, wait, wait. No, no, no.
You can't just go running

297
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,495
out there alone. That doesn't work.

298
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,584
Okay, you guys are just
running around all willy-nilly,

299
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,412
doing whatever the hell you want.
We can't do that.

300
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:17,414
All right, listen. U-Uh, Mac, Mac.

301
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:20,809
Tell me something, man.
Who-Whose face...

302
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,202
is on the 100 dolla dolla bill?

303
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:25,857
Rutherford B. Crazy, of course.

304
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,816
Rutherford B. Crazy. That's right.

305
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:31,080
Now, uh, why he be crazy, Mac?

306
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,647
- Well, uh...
- I never thought about it.

307
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,301
- I don't...
- Well, I'll tell you why.

308
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,563
See, my man had a dream.

309
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:38,261
To get into the laser beam business.

310
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:40,219
Right? And he never
gave up on the fundamentals.

311
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,482
He stuck with what works.

312
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,572
And now he get to go out and be
whatever the hell he want to be.

313
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,487
- He get to be crazy.
- Uh,

314
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,228
I don't think Rutherford
be a real person.

315
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,373
- Yeah...
- That's a cartoon.

316
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:51,535
No, no, no... no, not this guy.

317
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,928
Uh, I don't know who this guy is.

318
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:54,059
I'm talking about the real guy.

319
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,497
The guy who, like,
built this place 30 years ago.

320
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,064
That guy. He had a plan,
he stuck with it, you know,

321
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:01,763
and, uh, and now he gets
to be whatever he wanna be.

322
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:03,634
- You know, he get to be crazy.
- Okay.

323
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:07,421
So we aren't allowed to be happy now,

324
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:10,511
but as long as we are
unhappy for long enough,

325
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:13,470
- eventually we can be happy?
- Well, I'm not saying

326
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,298
you g-get to be happy; I'm saying...

327
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,154
being happy isn't the goal.

328
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,187
The goal is to play the game
and grind it out until the end.

329
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,478
And then at the end, then you can,

330
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:22,827
then you can go crazy.

331
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:26,222
- At the end of what?
- I don't... the game. The-the game!

332
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,006
You know, whenever we're playing
the game. You know what I mean?

333
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,268
And when is the end of the game?

334
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,096
I don't know.
Whenever the game ends, okay?

335
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,620
Whenever we're back on
top of the leaderboard

336
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,491
and we got all the dolla
dolla bills we need and...

337
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:35,505
Can I ask you guys a question?

338
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,276
It feels like we've been
playing this forever.

339
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:38,582
- Does-does that feel like that to you?
- A lifetime.

340
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:39,975
Feels like a lifetime.

341
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:41,629
- Yeah!
- I feel like I was born in this game

342
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:42,934
- and I will die in this game. I-I...
- That's right.

343
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,893
And this is the first time
I'm having fun in this game.

344
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,851
- Yeah.
- No, but-but it's not about... again, it's not about fun.

345
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:49,463
So just, let's just stick
with what works. Yeah?

346
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,250
- Nah.
- Nah, we're gonna go back there and have fun.

347
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,361
Let's have fun!

348
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,558
- Man, I want to have fun. I want to have fun.
- Goddamn it.

349
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,516
- This is getting out of control, man.
- Warning.

350
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,501
Oh! Ha!

351
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,694
It's a madhouse out there.

352
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:05,827
I was bobbing and weaving like crazy.

353
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:07,524
All right, nice.
At least somebody's out there

354
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:08,960
- doing what he's supposed to be doing.
- Oh, yeah.

355
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,484
I created a great little diversion.

356
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:13,617
I told this one dad
that another dad said

357
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:16,490
that his kid had a tight little dumper.

358
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,839
- Oh.
- Oh!

359
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,623
- That caused a riot.
- It did? - Yeah, I'll bet.

360
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:20,711
- Yeah, it worked.
- Hey, home run, Frank.

361
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,321
- Yeah.
- Although I'm a little surprised

362
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,671
it's not helping Mac and Dee more.
They're getting

363
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,847
- slaughtered out there in the war zone.
- Yeah. Whoa.

364
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:28,153
A war zone? I was in the Wing Zone.

365
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,329
You know, it was such a line.

366
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:33,332
I mean,
I had to create a melee to disperse it.

367
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,422
Goddamn it, Frank!
You weren't supposed to get wings!

368
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,554
Oh, shit, did you get hit?

369
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:38,773
- Did you get hit?
- Oh. No, no, no, no.

370
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:41,471
No, Charlie.
That's my signal that the food is ready.

371
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:42,690
- Oh!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,082
- I'm gonna go.
- Nice. Get some wings, baby.

373
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,170
All right,
I'm gonna get some wings.

374
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:46,650
Wait, wait, wait, Frank, before you go,

375
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:48,130
- hang on, hang on. Let me, uh...
- No, don't... Charlie.

376
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,001
- No, it's just so simple. Ready?
- Charlie. - What?

377
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,529
Oh!

378
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:56,878
Charlie.

379
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,445
- That's the way.
- Pretty good, right?

380
00:12:58,575 --> 00:12:59,968
- Now we're talking. I'll be back.
- All right.

381
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,360
- See you, Frankie!
- Okay!

382
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,971
See how happy he was?
I made a sound, too,

383
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,973
- 'cause I feel like that was...
- You are messing it up.

384
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,454
- Dude...
- You are messing it all up!

385
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,548
- Can we just go play?
- No, we... No!

386
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:15,649
We have to wait for Big Mo.

387
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,202
Why do you care so much about this kid?

388
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,595
Goddamn it, Charlie!
Don't you get it, man?

389
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,249
It's not the kid.

390
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,643
Okay, it's not the kid, it's-it's...

391
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:24,732
it's what the kid represents.

392
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:26,560
What, obesity?

393
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:27,778
No! Not obesity.

394
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:28,953
I don't even know if the kid's fat.
He's just called...

395
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,608
- He's probably fat.
- He's probably fat.

396
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,470
Yeah. Obesity rates being what they are,

397
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:34,965
- he's a fat kid.
- It's out of control.

398
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,613
- Feel like all those kids are fat.
- Well, most kids

399
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,342
I see running around
here are pretty fat...

400
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,156
They eat so much sugar these days, man.

401
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:41,400
- Well, it's in everything.
- Whatever.

402
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,706
The point is, like, I...

403
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,926
You know, there's always some Big Mo,
some kid coming in.

404
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,318
He wants to shoot you up, and he's...

405
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:47,798
he wants to take what you got.

406
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:49,017
I don't want to give him what I got.

407
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:50,322
What, I'm supposed
to give it to him, man?

408
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,498
I'm just supposed to let him have it?

409
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:53,717
Who gives a shit about the
Big Moes of the world, right?

410
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:55,806
'Cause we, we play the game,
we play the game,

411
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:57,416
but it's not like we ever win anything.

412
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:59,593
Dude, what are you talking about?

413
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,159
We've-we've been winning for years, man.

414
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:03,205
You know. We're the best!

415
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah, but, like, it's not like
we have anything to show for it.

416
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:08,732
Whatever, dude.
I got mad dolla dolla bills.

417
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,691
When those dolla dolla
bills stop coming in

418
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,257
because we stop playing the game...

419
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,259
dude, you know,
you're not gonna have those

420
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,523
little plastic army guys
that you like to play with.

421
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:19,003
- Oh, shit.
- You set 'em all up and you have 'em "pew..."

422
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:21,179
That is how I get them. I get them here.

423
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,920
You... Oh, and the little box
of bouncy balls that you love?

424
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:25,589
- They bounce so high!
- Dude, what is that?

425
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,581
- It's like the bounciest technology in the world.
- Exactly.

426
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,112
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

427
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,274
And you can only get 'em here.

428
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,233
But you lose 'em
'cause they bounce too high.

429
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:32,451
Yeah, you'd lose them sometimes.

430
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,192
- But you-you eat 'em.
- Nah.

431
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,238
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I've seen you put 'em in your mouth.

432
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,413
I've just tested 'em, you know, see...

433
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,371
- You tested 'em?
- Tested 'em out, and

434
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:40,634
sometimes I'm testing them in my stomach

435
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:41,896
just to see how they pass.

436
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,681
- Well, that's eating.
- Nah.

437
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,858
Okay. But either way, pal,
you like 'em, right?

438
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,338
- I do.
- You want more of 'em?

439
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:52,558
- I do.
- Gonna need them dolla dolla bills to-to-to get more of 'em,

440
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,176
which means we got to stay
on top of the leaderboard,

441
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:54,996
we got to win at the game.

442
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,215
And-and-and what about
our reputation, man?

443
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,218
- Oh...
- Think about, like, our-our legacy, dude.

444
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:01,350
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

445
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,225
We've been in this game
the longest, right?

446
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,571
But when we stop,
you think they're gonna throw us

447
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,132
some kind of parade?

448
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,661
- They're not, no.
- Hell no, man.

449
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,010
We're just gonna be a-a bunch of dudes

450
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,751
who, who played the game once,

451
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,052
you know? You want to be a ghost?

452
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,472
- No.
- Like the, like the fart

453
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,103
of meals past?
You just dissipate into the air,

454
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,584
and then everybody forgets that
you ever smelled up the place?

455
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,824
- What do you mean I disappear?
- Like a fart, man.

456
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,717
That's what I'm talking about.

457
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,545
'Cause that's what Big Mo is.
That's what he represents.

458
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,677
It's like a, a death.

459
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,548
- Death?!
- A dissipation. That's right.

460
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,116
So if you're talking about going
out there and having some fun,

461
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,292
all alone, by yourself,
to see what's out there?

462
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:31,946
You know what I mean?
You're giving this all up.

463
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:33,948
Okay? And you're not just
giving up being at the top

464
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:35,471
of the leaderboard at some, you know,

465
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,604
laser-amusement-themed park,
man, you're talking about

466
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,440
giving up everything. Everything.

467
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,477
Everything we built.

468
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,087
- Everything we worked so hard for.
- Goddamn it, you're right.

469
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,654
That's the death!
We'll be done! We'll be gone!

470
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,525
- Exactly, it's a death.
- We won't exist!

471
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:47,831
And we don't know

472
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,267
if we're ever gonna achieve that success

473
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,095
- ever again just out there.
- Damn it, all right,

474
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,402
fine, you're right.
We got, we got to guard this space,

475
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,444
and we can't let Big Mo come in here!

476
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,885
That's what I'm talking about, man.
That's what I'm talking about.

477
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:00,104
Oh, shit, though.
We're going down the leaderboard, man!

478
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,671
Hey, we can get it back, man.

479
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,325
- We got to protect the base, okay? Are you with me?
- Yes! Yes!

480
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:05,327
I'm never gonna stop playing this game!

481
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,850
- Warning.
- I'm never gonna stop... - Chicken wings!

482
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,112
Okay, yeah, let me get some.

483
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:09,331
- Here you go, here...
- Come on, let's do it.

484
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:10,332
All right, baby.

485
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,290
- What are you doing?!
- Got wings.

486
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,770
I was trying to keep Charlie focused,

487
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,511
and you ruined everything
with your goddamn wings, okay?

488
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,731
We get him wings at the end! At the end!

489
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:19,167
This game is going on too long!

490
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:22,866
Look, man, WWRD, right? WWRD.
What would Rutherford do?

491
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,520
- Hmm?
- Who?

492
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,826
Rutherford B. Crazy, the guy, the guy,

493
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,523
the guy who built this
entire emp-empire.

494
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,743
- What would he do?
- He'd do nothing. He's dead.

495
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:31,353
I'm talking about the guy. The real guy.

496
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,876
- Not-not the cartoon.
- Nah, the real guy.

497
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,966
Rutherford B. Crazy.
He's actually, his real name

498
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:38,142
- is Larry Takashi.
- Ah?

499
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:41,102
Yeah. I worked with him in the '90s.
He's dead.

500
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,625
- Huh.
- That, that can't be right.

501
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:43,931
- No, it's true.
- Warning.

502
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:46,592
Did you see the look on that kid's face

503
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:48,622
when I grabbed his glasses
and I-I threw 'em on the ground

504
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,328
- and stomped all over 'em?
- He blasted us to pieces,

505
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,330
but it was worth it just
to see his little ass cry.

506
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:54,568
Oh, Charlie,
you got to get out there with us.

507
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,030
It's so fun. We're finding all kinds

508
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,467
- of corners of this place that we've never explored before.
- Yeah, I'd love to,

509
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,642
I really would, but we're actually...

510
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,078
we're losing right now.

511
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:02,819
- Losing?
- I got to stay here.

512
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,342
- What? Yeah.
- Huh? Who cares if we're losing?

513
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,910
Dennis said, like, if-if-if we,
if we leave the base,

514
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,391
death is gonna come in
the form of a fat kid

515
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:10,697
who's gonna turn us into fart ghosts

516
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:13,308
or something like that.
So I got to stay.

517
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:14,389
What?

518
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,321
Death is gonna come
in the form of a fat child,

519
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,930
who will turn us into a fart.

520
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:20,036
It sounds crazy now that I'm saying it.

521
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,403
Dennis explained it a lot more better.

522
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,405
Dennis, we can't leave the base, right?

523
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:24,667
That's the deal?

524
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,669
No.

525
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,323
Frank was right.

526
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,979
Rutherford B. Crazy's real
name was Larry Takashi.

527
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,764
Yeah, and he was the founder
and owner of Laser Tag Fun Zone.

528
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,244
Yeah. So what, though?

529
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,159
Well, apparently, he killed himself.

530
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:39,987
- Really?
- What?

531
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,859
Yeah. He offed himself
about three years back now.

532
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,471
- Oh.
- Just opened his 100th Laser Tag Fun Zone,

533
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:48,691
and he drove himself to a wishing well

534
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:50,258
and threw himself down it.

535
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,738
Well, uh, hang on. Maybe it was a,

536
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,043
- maybe it was an accident.
- Oh.

537
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:55,785
Uh, no, he wrote a suicide note
on a Fun Zone dolla dolla bill,

538
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,787
and it said, "It all meant nothing."

539
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,726
- Ugh.
- Damn, man.

540
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,935
- Pretty grim.
- That's bleak.

541
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,270
- That's kind of bumming me out.
- It's clear. Very clear.

542
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,880
- Killed my appetite.
- Mm-hmm.

543
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:05,708
Nobody came to his funeral.

544
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,014
According to this,
his employees all hated him,

545
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,929
and his family barely knew him. I mean,

546
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,017
the guy was miserable.

547
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,540
But he spent his life
building this empire,

548
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,415
and-and it all meant nothing?

549
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,619
Shit. So Rutherford be rich.

550
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:19,026
Rutherford be successful as all hell.

551
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:20,810
But you know what else Rutherford be?

552
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:24,727
Rutherford be right.

553
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:27,817
Because it all means nothing
if you're not enjoying it.

554
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,732
The dolla dolla bills, you know?

555
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:32,378
The reputation, the longevity,
even the game itself.

556
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,821
What the hell does it matter
if you're not having fun?

557
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,422
You know,
if you're not having fun anymore,

558
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,784
than screw it.
So if something deep down inside you

559
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:39,886
is telling you it's time to move on,

560
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,005
then maybe that's what we should do.

561
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,268
So that's it?

562
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,271
That's it.

563
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:51,014
- Time to end the game?
- Time to end the game.

564
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,887
Goodbye, base?

565
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,891
Goodbye to the base we've
held down for so long.

566
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:00,023
I am gonna miss it.

567
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:03,157
But it's time to let Big Mo have it.

568
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:40,585
Hey, Big Mo.

569
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,112
Oh, what? You thought we'd gone?

570
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,070
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

571
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:48,855
We ain't going anywhere.

572
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:51,118
We're never leaving,
you little piece of shit.

573
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,380
Let him have it.

574
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:01,345
Yeah, light him up.

575
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,970
