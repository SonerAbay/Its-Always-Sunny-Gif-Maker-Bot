1
00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:03,311
ALL: Reunion! Reunion!

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:04,430
Reunion! Oh!

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:05,431
Smash 'em up!

4
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,433
DENNIS: This is great.

5
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:07,434
This brings me back.

6
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:08,436
CHARLIE: I know.

7
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:09,437
I'm, like, anxious, I'm excited.

8
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,439
SWEET DEE: It's Adriano
Calvanese, Charlie.

9
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,508
It's the guy who coined the name
Aluminum Monster, but I've got

10
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,443
a plan to get revenge.

11
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:15,444
TIM MURPHY: Yo, Dennis!

12
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:16,446
Shit!

13
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:18,115
That's Tim Murphy, the asshole
that slept with my prom date.

14
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:19,449
Uh, this is my wife, Christie.

15
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:21,452
Dennis and I used to be
really good friends.

16
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,454
MAC: Adriano made fake tickets!

17
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,456
Those tickets are fake!

18
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,458
Ronnie Rat strikes again, huh?

19
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,459
FRANK: Wait.

20
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,461
Ah! Goddamn... I don't have ringworm.

21
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,462
No, no, we're cool.

22
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,464
Yeah, we're like, the... Yeah. Oh! Oh!

23
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,465
Oh, really? Aah!

24
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,198
Son of a bitch.

25
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:56,631

26
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:03,226
Well, this is great, Dee.

27
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,268
This is just great.

28
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,504
Used to be king of the mountaintop.

29
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:09,480
Now I'm sitting alone at a table
at my high school reunion with

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,004
my sister, the Aluminum Monster.

31
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,855
Yeah, I know, I was on the
mountaintop, too, okay, Dennis?

32
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:14,863
(scoffs)

33
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,041
I got to find a way back there.

34
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,042
Got to get a plan.

35
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,109
Hold on!

36
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,244
Hold on a second.

37
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,414
Ingrid! Ingrid Nelson.

38
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,414
Hey!

39
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,283
INGRID: Hi, Dennis and Dee.

40
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,719
Oh, carrying around a clipboard, huh?

41
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,753
Dork.

42
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:34,391
Yeah, well, I'm on the alumni association, so...
(speaking gibberish mockingly)

43
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:35,392
(laughs)

44
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:36,393
Fatty Magoo!

45
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,394
Right?

46
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,394
Everybody, Fatty Magoo.

47
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,395
Honk!

48
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:41,397
What? Don't... What are you doing?

49
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,398
She's not fat anymore.

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,399
That doesn't really play.

51
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,402
It's not... Oh, really?

52
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:47,404
'Cause I'll see it on the sides,
and I'll see it in the thighs.

53
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,473
Still fat to me, still fat to you,
Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo,

54
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:52,676
Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo...
So, is this why you called me over here?

55
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:54,744
Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo,
Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Fatty

56
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:55,678
Magoo, Fatty Magoo!

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,681
All right, it was super
fun to see you guys.

58
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,681
Right? Everybody, Magoo!

59
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:59,683
Did anybody...?

60
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:00,684
Did you guys...?

61
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,685
Did you see her?

62
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:02,686
Drop it.

63
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,688
Oh, God, she just wasn't that
fat anymore, was she? Yeah.

64
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,657
No, she looks... That felt very forced.

65
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,526
Yeah, 'cause she's so pretty these days.
Doesn't...?

66
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,527
She looked fantastic.

67
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,429
No, she looked really good.

69
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,099
Only kind of works when you're sitting
at a table with the cool kids.

70
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,933
That seemed pathetic and mean.

71
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:15,934
Yeah, it was.

72
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,935
It did. It did. Wasn't it?

73
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:17,935
It was. Yeah.

74
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,670
Yeah. I got to find a way
back into that group.

75
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,439
Dee, I think you need to stop focusing
on how to get back <i>in</i>

76
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,440
<i>with them, and start focusing on</i>

77
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,374
<i>how to get</i> <i>revenge</i> on them.

78
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,144
Yeah, you're exactly right.

79
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,512
I need revenge <i>on</i> them.

80
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,513
And that's what I want, too.

81
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,514
Okay, well, what's our plan?

82
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,515
What's our plan?

83
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,515
Ooh, I want revenge.

84
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,350
All right, so here's-here's
how we're gonna do it.

85
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:34,351
Yeah.

86
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,187
I'm gonna bang Tim Murphy's black wife.

87
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,188
Oh, shit.

88
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,188
Yeah.

89
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,189
Oh, shit!

90
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,190
That'll do it.

91
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,024
That's gonna humiliate him.

92
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:41,859
That will humiliate him, yes!

93
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,860
Totally.

94
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,694
You know what I'll do?

95
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,695
Hmm?

96
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,530
I will bang Tim Murphy
to get back at Adriano.

97
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:47,531
Oh, that's a good plan.

98
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,532
What?! Yes!

99
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,202
The problem is, I don't think Tim
Murphy would ever sleep with you.

100
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,270
Wait a sec. Hold up.

101
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,271
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

102
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,272
What are you do...?

103
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,307
What's my part of the plan, then?

104
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,309
Hmm... Oh, grab this.

105
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,310
We only get two drink tickets.

106
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,313
Uh...

107
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,854
Whoa.

108
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,088
What happened?

109
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,089
Why am I hanging here?

110
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,090
The cool kids got us.

111
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,091
It was a massacre.

112
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,092
Ah, shit!

113
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,093
All right, you guys.

114
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,095
I'm ready to be your friend again.

115
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,096
No, Dee, get out of here.

116
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,097
Get away from us.

117
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,098
Get away from us.

118
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,098
What are you doing?

119
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Look, you guys, I'm on your team, okay?

120
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,101
I always <i>was</i> on your team.

121
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,170
I had a strike plan, but then
Cricket went and blew up my spot.

122
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,171
You goddamn bitch!

123
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,173
Okay, look, that's not the
important thing, all right?

124
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,174
Bitch!

125
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,509
The important part is that I'm
here now, and I'm on your

126
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:36,445
team, and I want revenge, and I need you
guys to help me come up with a plan.

127
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:37,446
She's right.

128
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:39,448
We need revenge, and I know
how we're gonna get it.

129
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,450
Yeah.

130
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,452
Charlie, we got to get the
freight train back together.

131
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:43,453
Freight train?

132
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,454
That's a great idea.

133
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,455
That's like a plan.

134
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,290
Nope. No, that's not a great idea.

135
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,291
That's a terrible idea.

136
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:50,126
What the hell is a freight train?

137
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,796
It's a stupid group of imbeciles
who called themselves a gang.

138
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,565
It was basically just
Charlie, Mac, and Dooley.

139
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,566
May he rest in peace.

140
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,467
God rest his soul.

141
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,202
And they were basically just
lackeys of this guy named Psycho

142
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,971
Pete, who genuinely was mentally ill.

143
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,805
Our conductor's insane.

144
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,806
Our cargo is pain.

145
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,808
Freight train!

146
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,809
Freight train!

147
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,810
Freight train!

148
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

149
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,646
Let's get a hold of this
Psycho Pete and kick some ass.

150
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,648
Yeah!

151
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,482
Let's do it! Freight train!

152
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:10,483
Yeah, get us down.

153
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:11,484
No.

154
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:12,484
No?

155
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,153
No, I don't like that plan, so... Huh?

156
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:15,954
Come on, get us down, Dee.

157
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:16,622
No.

158
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,456
We're gonna kick some ass.

159
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,290
Deandra, come back here.

160
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:18,957
Come on!

161
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,627
Goddamn... (grunting)

162
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:29,162
All right, let's just see if they
have Psycho Pete's name tag

163
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,047
and if they were expecting him.

164
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:32,883
'Cause, if we get our psycho back,
we get the freight train back.

165
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:33,884
Yes.

166
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:34,885
What's his last name?

167
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,886
Uh, I don't know.

168
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:36,887
No, me, neither.

169
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,722
Guess we weren't really that close.

170
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:40,557
It would have been cool
to be closer to him.

171
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,558
Yeah.

172
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,226
He was such a dark,
mysterious guy, you know?

173
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,227
Yeah.

174
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,896
What about this Peter
Schmidt-- is that the guy?

175
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:46,897
No.

176
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:47,731
Oh, no, that's Schmitty.

177
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,565
Yeah, ah, shit, is he coming?

178
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,566
No way.

179
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,334
Schmitty would never come
to something like this.

180
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:52,336
Not his scene.

181
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:54,070
If anything, he'll swoop in at
the very end, grab the drunkest

182
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,839
girl he can, take her home, bang her.

183
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:56,673
Ha, Schmitty's so cool.

184
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:00,343
Oh, yeah. Not that cool, though. Not as cool...
Way cooler than you, Dirtgrub.

185
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,144
Not as cool as Adriano.

186
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:01,979
Stop defending Adriano, okay?

187
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,648
Will you stop with the Schmitty stuff?

188
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,484
You know, snipping with each
other-- it's, like... Oh!

189
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:07,485
Oh! Magoo!

190
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:08,486
Hi.

191
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,321
Hey! I saw you trying to get by us.

192
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,356
I know.

193
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,991
You can't get away from us, Fatty,
Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo.

194
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:13,825
No, I'm not fat anymore.

195
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:14,626
That's not even accurate.

196
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:15,627
Ha.

197
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,628
That's true.

198
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,463
Well, you used to be fat.

199
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:18,464
I don't know.

200
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:19,298
Yeah, well, I'm not now.

201
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,132
I had a thyroid problem.

202
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:20,967
What's your excuse?

203
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:21,801
I've tacked on mass.

204
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:22,802
Really?

205
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,671
I've tacked on lots of mass, yes.

206
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,339
All right, all right, now,
do you remember Psycho Pete?

207
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,173
Unfortunately, yes.

208
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,842
Any word on if he's
coming tonight, or...?

209
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:29,676
Well, I hope not.

210
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:31,510
He's the reason we have extra security.

211
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,345
He threatened to burn
down the building.

212
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,180
Ha. That's...
He was probably just joking.

213
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,014
That's his sense of humor.

214
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,849
He has a very dark sense of humor.

215
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,685
You know, you got to
lighten up around Pete.

216
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,420
Was he joking when he cut his
family into little pieces and

217
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:42,354
ate them for Christmas dinner?

218
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:44,355
That doesn't sound like a joke.

219
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,356
Did that really happen?

220
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,358
Yeah, that sounds much more serious.

221
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,359
That's-That's grizzly.

222
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,360
Grizzly?

223
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:50,361
Psycho.

224
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,195
Psycho is how it sounds.

225
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,029
Psycho-- that's what it is.

226
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,030
Psycho.

227
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,865
That's how he got out of prison.

228
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:55,866
Oh, the insanity plea.

229
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:56,867
Yes.

230
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:57,702
Okay, well, that makes sense.

231
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,537
I would have gone with that
if I was his attorney.

232
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,438
Uh, although, really I
specialize in bird law, so I

233
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,374
don't want to mess around...
That's awesome.

234
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,376
So, it was really nice to, uh... Okay.

235
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:06,377
(Frank laughs)

236
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,379
So I guess the freight
train is gone, is that it?

237
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:09,380
Yeah.

238
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:10,381
Yes, let's get out of here.

239
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,384
Yes, I guess we're of to... It's over.

240
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,386
Hey, you guys, you guys,
you guys, okay, hi!

241
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:15,387
Oh, good to see you guys again.

242
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,388
Change of plans, okay?

243
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,458
I can't think of my own thing
to do, so I want to join the

244
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,392
freight train or whatever it is.

245
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:20,427
Get lost, bitch.

246
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,428
No, no, no, no!

247
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,429
Hang on a second.

248
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,430
Hang on a second.

249
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,798
Now, guys, the freight train
never let a loser down in need.

250
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,583
If Dee wants in on the freight train, we have
to let her in on the freight train.

251
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,089
Dee just has to do one thing.

252
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,091
She's got to go through the
freight train initiation.

253
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,460
We got to know that Dee's one of us.

254
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,461
So, Dee?

255
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,462
Yeah?

256
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,700
Are you willing to go through
the freight train initiation?

257
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,701
Yes, I am.

258
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,702
Oh, no, no!

259
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,703
Oh, goddamn!

260
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,704
Oh, no, no!

261
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,839
I am a grown woman!

262
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,842
I am a grown woman! Aah!

263
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,380
(pop ballad playing)

264
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,483
(groans): I mean, cuff links?

265
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,051
Tim, at a high school reunion?

266
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:00,320
It's not the Oscars.
I mean... Oh. (laughs)

267
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,321
Geez!

268
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,191
Yeah, and he can be a little
<i>too</i> nice sometimes.

269
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:05,192
Oh.

270
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:06,193
Can get a bit boring.

271
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,361
Oh, trust me, Christie,
he's boring as shit.

272
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:09,362
I know that, all right?

273
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,697
I'd rather get blasted in the
balls by a battering ram than

274
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,633
have to have a
conversation with the guy.

275
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:14,634
You're crazy!

276
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:15,901
(laughing): Am I crazy? Am I?

277
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:16,902
Yes.

278
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:17,736
He deceives people, Christie.

279
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,403
No.

280
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,404
That's what he d... Oh, yeah.

281
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,639
He steps on his friends to climb
to the top of the mountaintop,

282
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,576
where his good friend used to reign
supreme, that's what he does.

283
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,646
I mean, quite frankly, Christie,
(laughs) I think you can do a

284
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,781
lot better than him.

285
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,016
No, he's good to me.

286
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,552
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, but does he appreciate you?

287
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:36,723
I mean, Christie, does he appreciate...
all of that?

288
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,091
Dennis!

289
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,060
Baby's got back, Christie.

290
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,395
Baby's got back.

291
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:42,396
You know what I'm saying?

292
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:43,397
Am I right, though?

293
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,398
Am I right?

294
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,399
Listen, listen, listen.

295
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,300
I want to be inside you.

296
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:50,436
I want to do shit to you that is
gonna make you realize what a

297
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:55,273
worthless, boring piece of
shit your husband really is.

298
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,142
Wait a second, I'm confused.

299
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,211
Why would you want to have sex with <i>me?</i>

300
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,212
<i>Why the hell wouldn't I
want to have sex with you?</i>

301
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,548
<i>I mean, bam, boom, boom.</i>

302
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,084
<i>Because you're gay.</i>

303
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,084
<i>What?!</i>

304
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,252
<i>I'm not gay.</i>

305
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,420
<i>Dude, you're wearing makeup.</i>

306
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,422
<i>Yeah, I'm wearing a
little bit of makeup.</i>

307
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,424
<i>Who-who doesn't... And a girdle.</i>

308
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,926
<i>Yeah, I wanted to seem
thin for the occasion.</i>

309
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:14,927
<i>That's not weird.</i>

310
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,929
<i>You've also been gossiping with
me for the last 20 minutes.</i>

311
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:20,032
<i>I was speeding through the steps.
I have a system that...</i>

312
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:23,170
<i>I was demonstrating value on the
dance floor, and then I engaged</i>

313
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,339
<i>you physically when I put
my hands on your hips.</i>

314
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,407
<i>Now, I'm nurturing your
dependence by letting you talk</i>

315
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,344
<i>shit about your boring, worthless,
piece-of-shit husband.</i>

316
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,412
<i>Then I was gonna take you to an
empty broom closet and I was</i>

317
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,346
<i>gonna bang the shit out of you.</i>

318
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,349
<i>And then I was gonna
neglect you emotionally.</i>

319
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,216
<i>That's what I do, Christie.</i>

320
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:36,884
<i>And it was working.</i>

321
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,252
<i>I was manipulating your feeble</i>

322
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,188
<i>little brain into doing what</i>
<i>I</i> <i>want-- what</i> <i>I</i> want!

323
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,023
And then now it's what you want.

324
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:42,690
Ew!

325
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:45,460
Oh, ew! Yeah, aw, oh, yeah,
okay, well, your husband is a

326
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,995
liar, how about that, Christie?

327
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:48,363
Yeah, stay with a liar!

328
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,031
And a deceiver.

329
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:54,735
You... Tim does not deserve to
be the king of the mountaintop.

330
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:56,738
<i>I</i> am the king of the mountaintop!

331
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,739
(music stops)

332
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:01,542
<i>I</i> reign supreme over
everyone in this school.

333
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,969
I am the golden god of this place.

334
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,598
I reign supreme.

335
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:07,274
I!

336
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:09,818
I!

337
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,621
(chatter, music resume)

338
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:23,592
Dee, I'm sorry we threw your
back out, but you're lucky

339
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:24,888
that's the worst thing that happened.

340
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,997
And it's a lucky thing I
brought the back brace.

341
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,899
Oh, yes, lucky! So lucky!

342
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,768
I'm feeling very, very lucky to
have my asshole ripped in half

343
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,571
like tissue paper by my father
and his very good friends.

344
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:38,940
A-A-And also, I'm feeling
incredibly lucky to be making

345
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:42,009
another appearance as the Aluminum
Monster after so many years.

346
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,010
Thank you, thank <i>you.</i>

347
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:46,013
<i>And I don't think you're gonna get
to bang Adriano now, either.</i>

348
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,015
<i>Oh, you don't think so, Charlie?
You don't think so?</i>

349
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,017
<i>Guys, this whole thing has
been a wash, all right?</i>

350
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,086
<i>Let's just get out of here,
because there's no way that</i>

351
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:54,555
<i>we're gonna get revenge on those
guys without Psycho Pete.</i>

352
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:56,958
<i>Yeah, I've been humiliated enough.</i>

353
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,160
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

354
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,561
<i>You bastard!</i>

355
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:00,728
<i>You bastard!</i>

356
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,030
<i>Whoa! Jesus Christ!</i>

357
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,031
<i>(Dennis yells)</i>

358
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,033
<i>Dennis, you're coming out hot.</i>

359
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:08,069
<i>(panting): I am the king of
the minions, not Tim Murphy!</i>

360
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:09,604
<i>Not that jerk-off idiot!</i>

361
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:10,839
<i>He... jerk-off!</i>

362
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:13,041
<i>What the hell are you doing, man?</i>

363
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,610
<i>She rejected</i> <i>me.</i>

364
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:15,678
<i>Me, Frank, me!</i>

365
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,946
<i>The coolest guy in the history
of this goddamn school!</i>

366
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:18,948
<i>Oh, they're all gonna pay.</i>

367
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,950
<i>They're all gonna pay
the ultimate price!</i>

368
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:22,951
<i>Whoa!</i>

369
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:23,952
<i>(Sweet Dee gasps)</i>

370
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:26,188
<i>Dude, what's all that
stuff you're grabbing?</i>

371
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,189
<i>Tools!</i>

372
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:28,190
<i>Tools!</i>

373
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:31,327
<i>Uh, duct tape, zip ties and gloves!</i>

374
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,328
<i>I have to have my tools!</i>

375
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,529
<i>(panting)</i>

376
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,265
<i>Well, why do you have a bunch
of, like, weird tools in a</i>

377
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:37,499
<i>hidden compartment in your car?</i>

378
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,534
<i>It's fetish, it's fetish shit!</i>

379
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:43,705
<i>I-I-I-I like to bind...
I like to be bound.</i>

380
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:44,706
<i>Uh, that's not important!</i>

381
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,707
<i>There has to be questions!</i>

382
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:46,708
<i>I'm not taking questions!</i>

383
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,711
<i>The golden god is not taking questions!</i>

384
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:49,879
<i>I am the golden god!</i>

385
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:50,880
<i>And I'm taking action.</i>

386
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,049
<i>I got to go. I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>

387
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,984

<i>(Dennis groans)</i>

389
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,486
<i>I think we can help you, dude.</i>

390
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:58,487
<i>Yeah?</i>

391
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:00,289
<i>Yeah, we can help each other.</i>

392
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,791
<i>We both want the same thing.</i>

393
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:04,726
<i>Revenge.</i>

394
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,394
<i>(Dennis panting)</i>

395
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:09,330
<i>You're gonna be our new
Psycho Pete, pal.</i>

396
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:11,265
<i>And guess what?</i>

397
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,467
<i>The freight train's back in service!</i>

398
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:14,468
<i>Let's get nuts in that school.</i>

399
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,702
<i>Let's get crazy, all right?</i>

400
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,504
<i>Come on, let's get some revenge here.</i>

401
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:18,505
<i>Train's coming.</i>

402
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,505
<i>Watch out for that train.</i>

403
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:20,506
<i>Watch out for that train.</i>

404
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,507
<i>The train's coming!</i>

405
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:22,509
<i>Make way!</i>

406
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:23,510
<i>Freight train coming through!</i>

407
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:24,344
<i>All aboard!</i>

408
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:25,011
<i>Choo-choo!</i>

409
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:28,015
<i>No, we don't do the toot-toots...
We're a train.</i>

410
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:29,016
<i>Why wouldn't we toot-toot?</i>

411
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,018
<i>It's just not what we do, okay?</i>

412
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,019
<i>Okay, bitches!</i>

413
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,688
<i>Get ready for the steam engine!</i>

414
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,689
<i>And get it!</i>

415
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:36,791
<i>I'm gonna destroy you all.</i>

416
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,527
<i>But I want Murphy first.</i>

417
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,929
<i>So let's go, Murphy, you and me,
once and for all. Come on!</i>

418
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:42,931
<i>What you gonna do now, pussies?</i>

419
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:43,765
<i>We got our psycho back.</i>

420
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:44,432
<i>Yeah!</i>

421
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,434
<i>What the hell are you
guys talking about?</i>

422
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:48,435
<i>Talking about the
freight train, cowboy!</i>

423
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:50,437
<i>Look, everybody, the
Aluminum Monster's back.</i>

424
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:51,104
<i>It's a good look.</i>

425
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,540
<i>Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, it's
really good, it's really...</i>

426
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,675
<i>Just send Murphy out, so
our psycho can bash him.</i>

427
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,677
<i>Okay, you guys, let's get out
of here-- this is weird.</i>

428
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,677
<i>See you.</i>

429
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,812
<i>Where you going? You afraid?</i>

430
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,780
<i>(all mock crying)</i>

431
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,114
<i>No. We're not afraid;</i>

432
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:04,115
<i>we're in our 30s.</i>

433
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,116
<i>We don't fight people anymore.</i>

434
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,117
<i>It's kind of pathetic.</i>

435
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>Yeah? Well, too bad, 'cause the
fury's already coming, bitch.</i>

436
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:10,622
<i>So too late.</i>

437
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:13,891
<i>Oh-ho-ho, you just couldn't
stand it, could you?</i>

438
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:18,896
<i>You couldn't stand Dennis Reynolds...
reigning on high!</i>

439
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,831
<i>King of all the school!</i>

440
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,966
<i>Master of everybody!</i>

441
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:24,969
<i>You couldn't stand it, so you had
to turn everybody against me.</i>

442
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:25,970
<i>Dude, listen to yourself.</i>

443
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,972
<i>Nobody turned anybody against you.</i>

444
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:29,473
<i>You were never that cool to begin with.</i>

445
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:32,142
<i>Seriously, man, you would just
come around saying weird</i>

446
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:34,377
<i>shit about being a golden god
or some other insane crap.</i>

447
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,879
<i>And referring to all of
us as your minions.</i>

448
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,247
<i>You always</i> <i>acted</i> like
you were better than everybody else,

449
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:40,249
but then you'd just go and
you'd hang out with Ronnie

450
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:43,252
the Rat or Dirtgrub under the bleachers
or behind a Dumpster or something.

451
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,254
It was... it was really weird.

452
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,255
Weird.

453
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,256
Yeah, sure, okay.

454
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:48,359
Yeah, well, if I wasn't the
coolest guy in school, then why

455
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:51,463
did you have to try and tear me
down by sleeping with my prom date?

456
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,899
(chuckles): I didn't sleep
with your prom date.

457
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,300
Yes, you did!

458
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:56,635
No, I didn't.

459
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,437
Ronnie the Rat did.

460
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,438
Wait, what?

461
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Ronald McDonald slept
with your prom date.

462
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,442
Did he tell you that I slept with her?

463
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,444
I never would have
slept with that chick.

464
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,445
She was <i>gross.</i>

465
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:07,446
<i>She was gross.</i>

466
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,447
<i>(quietly): She</i> <i>was</i> gross.

467
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,449
She was gross, I remember that, yeah.

468
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,450
She was really gross.

469
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,451
You slept with my prom date?

470
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:14,086
No.

471
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,087
Yes.

472
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,288
How could you do that to me?

473
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,789
It was very easy.

474
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,790
Uh, she was a whore.

475
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:19,791
I'm gonna kill you.

476
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:20,458
No, don't.

477
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,459
I'm gonna kill you!

478
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,428
I'm gonna kill you, you
fat piece of shit!

479
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,429
This is mass!

480
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,430
This is mass!

481
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,898
Don't make it about my weight!

482
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
You guys are good. So... Take care!

483
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,237
I know she was a whore, but
she was <i>my</i> whore!

484
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,238
All right!

485
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,774
Calm down!

486
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:35,775
This is pathetic.

487
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:37,710
This is awful.

488
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,346
We've all been humiliated.

489
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:41,981
Our asses are destroyed.

490
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:42,982
Yeah.

491
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:45,018
Mm-hmm.

492
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,087
And Dennis turned out to be a loser.

493
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:47,754
You know what?

494
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,823
Let's just go back to the bar, right?

495
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:50,590
The bar's where we belong.

496
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:51,525
The bar's where we fit in.

497
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,259
We can hide from the world at the bar.

498
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:55,028
Yes, yes, I agree with Charlie.

499
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,863
I never want to step foot in
this high school ever again.

500
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:57,864
Right?

501
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:58,865
Yes.

502
00:13:58,867 --> 00:13:59,866
No!

503
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,102
We can't go out like that.

504
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:06,339
Look, if life pushes you
down, you got to push back.

505
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,343
If you're dealt a bunch of
lemons, you got to take those

506
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:14,547
lemons and stuff them down somebody's
throat until they see yellow.

507
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:18,285
And if some punk-ass kid
humiliates you, you got to do

508
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:20,453
the only thing that's left to do.

509
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:21,454
Yeah!

510
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:22,122
Whoa, whoa.

511
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:22,789
Yes, Frank.

512
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,391
Oh, wow, that was a great speech, man.

513
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,127
That's the most coherent thing
that's ever come out of your mouth.

514
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,795
That was awesome, dude.

515
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,230
You usually just ramble
on and on and on.

516
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:30,998
That was like a basketball coach.

517
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,932
All right, so what is it?

518
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:32,933
Yeah.

519
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,835
Yeah.

520
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,170
Huh?

521
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,406
What's the one thing left to do?

522
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:41,476
What is it?

523
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:46,548
Well, the thing of it is, is that,
uh, there's the lemon stuff.

524
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,549
Right.

525
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,453
And then you got Mac, who's a rat.

526
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,655
And Dee's body brace.

527
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:59,160
And, uh, and that's the thing of it, and...
It's good.

528
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:00,595
What are you saying?

529
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:03,098
No, you were gonna tell us what to do.

530
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,767
That doesn't... we didn't ask if
something was good or if it wasn't good.

531
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:06,702
I lost my train of thought.

532
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:07,636
Let's go back to the bar.

533
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:08,637
Yep.

534
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

535
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:13,610
Were you gonna suggest
that we should do plan B?

536
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,611
No.

537
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,279
Plan B!

538
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,346
That's what I was going to say!

539
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,815
That's... we're not doing plan B.

540
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,483
Listen, man, hey, listen.

541
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,417
We worked so hard on it.

542
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,018
Come on, we're not doing
plan B, it's ridiculous.

543
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,056
Dennis, Dennis, plan B might be
the only option we have left.

544
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,057
Ah, come on.

545
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:26,724
Come on, Dennis.

546
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,093
Jesus, come on, plan B is...
(chanting): Plan B, plan B... Shh, not too loud.

547
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,794
No, it's... All right, all right.

548
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:36,333
Will you stop whispering plan B like
it's some super covert CIA operation?

549
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,605
Plan B is a dance routine.

550
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,808
It's a goddamned dance routine.

551
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,280
And it's gonna rock.

552
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,918
Beep beep.

553
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,919
Get out of here.

554
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:54,587
Beep beep bop.

555
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,723
We're gonna need this dance floor...
Clear the dance floor.

556
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:58,992
Clear the dance floor.

557
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:00,193
Let's go, let's go.

558
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:01,194
Bring it on, bitches!

559
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:01,995
Go on!

560
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,597
All right, listen up, jerks!

561
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,931
Listen to us, listen to us.

562
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:08,535
There's been a lot of negative energy
going on at this school, okay?

563
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,539
So I want to talk to you guys
a little bit about dancing.

564
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,009
Now, back in the '50s and the
'60s and the '70s, people used

565
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:16,209
to dance all the time.

566
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,211
That's the way we solved
our problems back then.

567
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:21,180
That's how they solved their
problems-- through dance.

568
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:23,916
Then, all of a sudden,
we stopped dancing.

569
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,151
You know?

570
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:29,356
Grunge came in, we dressed in
plaid and oversized jeans.

571
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:32,360
Then, later on, kids wore trench
coats and shot each other in

572
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:33,561
school, and that's not cool.

573
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:34,763
But guess what.

574
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:36,665
Guess what's going on
in the high school now.

575
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,899
Kids are dancing again.

576
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,901
Organized choreographed dance.

577
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:42,204
They're doing organized choreographed
dances to solve their problems.

578
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,972
They also give each other blow jobs.

579
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,406
They got these things
called rainbow parties.

580
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:46,074
No, Charlie.

581
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:47,775
All right, wrap it up,
wrap it up, wrap it up.

582
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:48,443
Let's go.

583
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:51,712
No, but they have these rain...
Yeah, but that's not the point of the...

584
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,614
The point is, we're
gonna show you a dance!

585
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:54,515
Let's get started.

586
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,817
Let's go!

After party back at
my house, all right?

607
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:08,417
Everyone's invited.

Yeah, man.

614
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:23,997
It was a perfect dance.

615
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:24,931
They just didn't respond to it.

616
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,534
I don't understand how that didn't
blow people's minds, though.

617
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:29,136
Guys, guys, we did a great job, okay?

618
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,804
Listen, don't, don't get down
on yourselves, all right?

619
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:31,505
Those people are stupid.

620
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,506
They're idiots, they're savages.

621
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:33,607
They just didn't get it.

622
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,275
Oh, come on.

623
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,409

00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,514
Wow, great dance, assholes.

626
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,515
You know what?

627
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:44,819
Just like you low-life shits,
I didn't get invited to the

628
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:47,022
after party either, but whatever.

629
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:50,492
I'm just gonna have sex with somebody
to feel better about myself.

630
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:54,629
I'm gonna bang the next
person who talks to me.

631
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,998
So who's it gonna be?

632
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,999
Hi-yah!

633
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:57,666
How you doing, fellas?

634
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:58,334
Hey, Schmitty, excuse me.

635
00:19:58,336 --> 00:19:59,101
How you doing, having fun?

636
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,035
Hey, did I miss the festivities?

637
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,803
Excuse... What are we doing here?

638
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:02,471
What's going on?

639
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:03,138
Schmidt, no, no!

640
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,805
Hey, how are you?

641
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:05,541
Oh, do you want to have sex with me?

642
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:06,208
Yes, I do.

643
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,876
Well, there you go.

644
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:07,543
See you, guys.

645
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:08,544
Monster.

646
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:09,544
Oh!

647
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:10,212
You all right?

648
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,146
Where do you want to go?

649
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:11,847
You got a car?

650
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:12,514
I don't know.

651
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:13,549
We'll use mine, come on.

652
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,251
Schmitty.

653
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,487
Let's go back to the bar, huh?

654
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:18,488
Yeah.

655
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,155
Let's go, Charlie.

656
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,390
Yeah.

657
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:22,658
Schmitty just... Schmitty.

658
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,304
Swooped in and grabbed the
most disgusting girl here.

659
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:30,960
