1
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:09,537
What are you doing?

2
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:11,204
I got a tickle, a
really bad one.

3
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:12,157
Oh, shit, are you getting sick?

4
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:13,615
If you're getting sick, stay
away from us.

5
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,308
N-N-N-No, I'd better not be
getting sick.

6
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:16,174
I can't be getting sick.

7
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:17,892
I got to be able to talk to
Groban tomorrow.

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:18,979
- Who?
- Josh Groban.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,215
Artemis and I got backstage
passes to his concert in the

10
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:22,149
park tomorrow.

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,451
Charles Grodin is coming in
concert and you didn't tell us?

12
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:28,456
Aw, we love Charles Grodin.
That dude is hysteri... I love that guy.

13
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,990
He brings out the curmudgeon
in me. Yeah.

14
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,893
No, no, different guy.
Josh Groban is who I'm talking about.

15
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:34,962
Josh Groban, oh.
Is he Charles Grodin's son?

16
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:36,296
He's probably funny.
What do you think?

17
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,999
If he's related to Charles Grodin,
he is. Don't worry about that.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,001
Yeah, two totally different people.

19
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,904
Charles Grodin is a bitter old
man with a giant head, and Josh

20
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:46,940
Groban is a beautiful singer
with the voice of an angel.

21
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:48,842
Oh, he's a singer.
Call Charles Grodin a bitter

22
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,844
old man one more time and see
what happens!

23
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:51,845
Ooh, ooh, calm down.

24
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,314
Alright, alright, sorry,
alright, no big deal.

25
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,283
I got to go home anyway.
I should rest.

26
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:59,160
Stay... Come on.
No, don't come near me.

27
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,854
Don't make me sick. Alright,
alright, don't touch me with that.

28
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,756
Don't make me sick. Get out!
Hey, stop it.

29
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:05,864
Mom, Mom, calm down,
calm down, listen to me.

30
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,227
Okay, here's what you do, okay?

31
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,697
You close the curtains and you
mind your own business, right?

32
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,233
They're not terrorists!
They're just Muslims.

33
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:17,070
Okay, well, I'm gonna hang up,
okay? Hanging up.

34
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,071
Unbelievable, dude.

35
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:20,274
Ever since my Uncle Jack moved
out, my mom's going crazy.

36
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:22,676
She's like, "Help me with this,
help me with that, wash the

37
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:25,345
floor, wash the ceiling, clean
my car, get this, fix that.

38
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,714
Are there spiders here?
Are there spiders there?"

39
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:29,983
I'm sorry, the woman who
brought you into the world and

40
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:32,319
raised you needs you and you're
going to ignore her?

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,925
Dude, it's crazy shit, it's
insane shit, and I can't be

42
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:37,011
constantly taking care of her.
I don't blame you, man.

43
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:40,208
I'm very much looking forward to not
taking care of anyone when I'm older.

44
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,038
Well, what, what, you're not going
to take care of me when I'm old?

45
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,763
Hell, no, I'm not going to
take care of you; you were a

46
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:47,275
terrible father to me.
Oh, I'll get Deandra to take care of me.

47
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,160
- She'll take care of me.
- Dee won't take care of you.

48
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,838
You just chased her out of here with
a pool cue because she had a little cough.

49
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,607
Forget about it.

50
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:56,183
That's her.
Answer the phone, Charlie.

51
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,670
I'm just going to let it ring
'cause it's crazy shit.

52
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,372
Charlie, answer the goddamn
phone! Just...

53
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,091
It's not anything serious, Mac!

54
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:03,073
What?!
Hello, what, what is it?

55
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:08,155
Yeah.
Oh, well, that is a serious thing.

56
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:11,844
Okay, I'll let him know. Uh, Mac,
your mom burned her house down.

57
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:24,389
Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia - 06x06

58
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:50,314
Hey-o!

59
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:51,582
Good news, Dennis.

60
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,514
Mom's okay.

61
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:55,586
She fell asleep with a lit
cigarette in her mouth and

62
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:58,322
burned the entire house down,
but the good news is she's fine.

63
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:01,425
Uh, oh, great. Yeah.

64
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:04,128
Um, where is she going to be
staying?

65
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,730
Here, of course.
I'll stay in a shelter.

66
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,700
Hey, there's an idea... Shelter.
Absolutely not.

67
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,469
- Okay, what about a nice nursing home?
- Nursing home?

68
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,323
Do you have any idea what
happens in those places, dude?

69
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,747
Why don't I just rape her
myself?

70
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,542
Rape her...? What are you
talking about? What?

71
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:20,944
Yo, got your dog.

72
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:23,647
Poppins, hey, buddy, how you
doing?

73
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,848
Poppins.

74
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,450
My God, I can't believe
that dog's not dead.

75
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:28,118
Didn't you get him when
you were, like, ten?

76
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:30,721
Oh, yeah, this dog is
indestructible, dude.

77
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:32,722
Yeah, that dog is nasty, man.

78
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:34,424
I mean, he was, like, coughing
the whole way over here.

79
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,025
He ate a couple cigarette
butts off the ground.

80
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:36,692
He's got a wheeze.

81
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:37,960
He might have emphysema, man.

82
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,761
Oh, that's entirely possible.

83
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:42,031
Yeah, it wouldn't slow him
down, though; he's a survivor.

84
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,733
He would disappear for months,
but he would always come home.

85
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,334
Yeah, it looks like his
eye is falling out.

86
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:46,002
Oh, is it?

87
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:46,669
What, it just bulges?

88
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,271
Yeah, it bulges out
a little bit there.

89
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,824
Yeah, what you do is
you just pop it back with your knuckle.

90
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:53,681
- I'll show you how to do it. It's real easy.
- I'm never gonna do that,

91
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,711
You're gonna touch his
eye with your knuckle?

92
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,281
You just, you just sort
of pop it back in.

93
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:58,679
Oh, hang on a second.

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,884
What, Mom, what?

95
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,253
I'm not going to vacuum your ceiling.

96
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,643
Um, 'cause I already did it, okay?!

97
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:06,339
Dude!

98
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:09,929
- Plastic splinters are the same as...
- You won't get a splinter!

99
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,679
I got to go deal with this, man.

100
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:13,579
My mom wants me to...
No, no, no, no, no, no,

101
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:14,302
wait, hold on a second.

102
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:15,212
It's back in, Dennis, check it out.

103
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:15,931
I don't care.

104
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,933
I have an idea that's going to
solve all of our problems here,

105
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:18,600
I do.

106
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,603
Your moms are going to live together.
Now hear me out.

107
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:21,571
This is going to be great.

108
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:23,807
Okay, Mac, your mom burned down
her house with a cigarette,

109
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:24,374
right?

110
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,543
Charlie, Uncle Jack moved out
of your mom's house, so she's

111
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,244
lonely, she's got no one to talk to.

112
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,280
Boom...
Mrs. Mac, your mom together.

113
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,281
Could be the perfect situation.

114
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,282
Come on.

115
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,458
They could be like
"The Golden Girls".

116
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:34,779
You know, a couple of old ladies

117
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:37,075
getting together, chasing
men, eating cheesecake.

118
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,029
That'd be cool.

119
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,289
Sure, whatever.

120
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,223
I'm loving that idea, but my

121
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:42,292
mom's going to be a
tough sell, man.

122
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,293
Uh-huh.

123
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:44,260
I'll talk her into it.

124
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,829
Oh, it popped back out.

125
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:55,140
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

126
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,493
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:57,887
Oh, I went to the
health food store.

128
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,111
I just grabbed a whole
bunch of shit.

129
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,869
It's supposed to boost
my immune system.

130
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:02,425
I'm not going to miss
that show, Frank.

131
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,522
I'm a Grobanite.

132
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:04,817
Grobanites don't miss shows.

133
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,610
Josh Groban comes to town and we
consider it a call to action.

134
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,769
What you're saying
is very dorky.

135
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,935
Nevertheless, I brought you some
stuff... A little bit of care package here.

136
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,891
Why?
I wanna make you well.

137
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,835
Coffee, I got you some Mexican peanuts...

138
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:21,579
I got you some candy...

139
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,450
I got you Stud magazine.

140
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,250
What's your angle?
What are you doing?

141
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:26,527
Deandra..

142
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,235
We have to take care of each other.

143
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,881
I'm gonna take care of you now

144
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,235
and when I'm old and sick,

145
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,980
- you have to take care of me.
- What?

146
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,423
No, no. I'm not doing that. Absolutely not.
You're on your own.

147
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,412
But... You OK?

148
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:42,561
Yeah? No? Sit down.

149
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:44,567
Open up. Put your head back.

150
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:47,178
Oh, God. Ugh.

151
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,473
Oh God.

152
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:52,518
- Oh my God.
- Look, you know what? You should go relax.

153
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:54,024
You should go rest now.

154
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,997
OK, look. I'm gonna do anything you need.

155
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,685
Anything you need, I will do it.

156
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,495
- Just make believe I'm your slave.
- Okay.

157
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,401
Do my laundry.

158
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,446
- Done.
- Alright.

159
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,669
- I'm gonna go rest. Don't bother me.
- Alright.

160
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,832
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
as quiet as a mouse.

161
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,098
You just rest, honey.

162
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:12,155
Mm-hmm.

163
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:16,150
? ?

164
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:21,859
Okay, alright.

165
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,595
Well, ladies, I know this is a
lot to digest, and that's why

166
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,998
I'm here... to act as an unbiased
negotiator in the process, and

167
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,135
to sort out any
problems or concerns.

168
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,871
Essentially just to make sure
that you're both comfortable

169
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,470
with this new arrangement.

170
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:39,409
I don't want to live with her.

171
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,443
Oh! Mom, why not?!

172
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:41,444
She smells.

173
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:42,445
I know she smells.

174
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,811
Alright... Okay, you can't
talk about my mom like that.

175
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,728
Okay... You don't smell, and
you look beautiful, okay?

176
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:50,835
Okay, I think what Charlie's
mom is trying to say is that

177
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:54,624
Mrs. Mac has a unique
and earthy fragrance.

178
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,625
I smell like shit.

179
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,994
Okay, Mom, don't put
yourself down, okay?

180
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:58,995
We talked about this.

181
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:01,030
You know, perhaps we could get Mrs.
Mac some perfume?

182
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,098
Oh, that's not a bad idea.

183
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:03,299
Mrs. Mac, what do you say?

184
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
What better way to kick off this

185
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,302
new relationship than
with a new fragrance?

186
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,304
Stop talking to me
like I'm an asshole.

187
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,305
Yeah.

188
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:10,306
She can't smoke in here.

189
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:12,842
I know, Mom. Uh...
Okay, okay, okay, well,

190
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:15,545
that's... Well, now, Mrs.
Mac, I would never ask you to give up

191
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:18,081
tobacco, but what if you were to
switch to some sort of smokeless

192
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,082
tobacco alternative?

193
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,351
Ugh!

194
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:22,352
I know that grunt.

195
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:23,786
She's open to it.

196
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:24,854
Okay, so what do we say, we

197
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,123
do a little bit of a
trial run tonight?

198
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:29,150
Let's see what happens, and
then we'll take it from there.

199
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:31,575
Okay.

200
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:37,039
- That means absolutely.
- Okay.

201
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,333
Great, great, great.

202
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,998
So, last step. Dog's tied up outside.
I'll grab him

203
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:43,279
- and get him inside and be on my way.
- No, no, no dog.

204
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,208
- Charlie, tell them.
- OK, she is terrified of

205
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:50,543
animals eating her face off...

206
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,679
I don't want a dog to eat my face, Charlie.

207
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,859
- You want a dog eating her face?
- Well, you know,

208
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,941
That's not a problem.
We'll take the dog.

209
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,933
Oh, what I think Mac is trying to say...

210
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,996
- is not that we'll take the dog...
- I'm saying exactly what I wanna say.

211
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,325
What I'm trying to say now is that
we're taking the dog.

212
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:06,915
What I'm trying to say, Frank...

213
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:08,012
We're taking the dog.

214
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,234
We're not taking the dog...

215
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,754
He's not going to eat

216
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,297
- my mother's face off.
- He's gonna be home with us.

217
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,573
Alright, alright, alright!

218
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,514
Fine, we'll take the dog.

219
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:27,031
Laundry's done.

220
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,185
Uh, those white shorts on top?

221
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:30,254
That's part of my outfit for
tomorrow, so why don't you go

222
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:31,255
and run an iron over those?

223
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:33,524
Oh! Hey, very whitey white.

224
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,926
Uh, you're not ragging
it, are you?

225
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:36,927
What?!

226
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:37,928
What? Gross, Frank.

227
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,929
Come on.

228
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,930
You still get periods?

229
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:40,931
What are you doing?

230
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:41,932
Stop asking me that.

231
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:42,933
What? Gross! Come on.

232
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:43,934
I'm trying to bond with you.

233
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:44,969
That's how you want to bond

234
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,971
with me? Asking me if
I still get periods?

235
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:48,973
What's that stuff
you're putting on?

236
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:50,007
That's beautiful. What is it?

237
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:52,009
Self tanner. For tomorrow.

238
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,011
Got to look good for Groban.

239
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,013
The, uh, tan's gonna make the
white in the outfit pop, the

240
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,014
white's gonna make the tan pop.

241
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,016
Josh Groban likes his
ladies to pop, so...

242
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,685
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
look who I brought.

243
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,853
It's Poppins! Yeah.

244
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:03,854
Oh, God.

245
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:06,175
That's Poppins?

246
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,176
Ooh. Yeah.

247
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:08,177
He's still alive?

248
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:09,145
Oh, yeah, yeah.

249
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,980
I figured he could keep you
company while you're sick.

250
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,981
Oh.

251
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:13,783
Dog looks like a gargoyle.

252
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,551
Yeah. He smells like piss.

253
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:16,652
Uh-huh.

254
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,653
Does it? Uh, uh-oh.

255
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:18,521
Is he dying?

256
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:19,522
No, no, no, he's fine.

257
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,223
Uh, by the way, you're gonna
want to keep him away from that

258
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,025
cream, too, 'cause
he'll eat that shit.

259
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:24,375
Yeah, he ate a whole bottle of
shampoo at our apartment earlier.

260
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:25,209
He loves shit like that.

261
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,709
Wow.

262
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,477
Yeah.

263
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,479
Sounds great.
Thanks for bringing him over, yeah.

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,113
Great dog.

265
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:29,880
He's a great dog.

266
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,815
I'm gonna finish this
up in my bedroom.

267
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:32,834
Frank, why don't you
make me another juice?

268
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:35,238
'Cause I feel like that green stuff's
really working.
You got it.

269
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:38,553
Great. So, you'll keep the
dog here, and then, uh...

270
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:39,556
What are you doing, Frank?

271
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:40,524
What's going on here?

272
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,526
Trying to score brownie
points with your sister.

273
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:43,527
I mean, I need somebody to take

274
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,396
care of me when I'm
old and sick.

275
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,264
Oh, Jesus, you're still
worried about that?

276
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:50,000
Why don't you just check yourself
into a nursing home, Frank?

277
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,001
You have the money.

278
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:52,936
I'm not gonna put myself
into one of those crypts.

279
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:54,805
As soon as you drop the
soap, they rape your butt.

280
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:55,806
What?

281
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:56,807
That's what happens.

282
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:57,808
Mac told me.

283
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,610
What are you...? God...
People have a very strange

284
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,412
conception of what goes
on in nursing homes.

285
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:02,413
Frank, green juice, now!

286
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,782
The bitch is
driving me crazy!

287
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,117
She's not even sick anymore.

288
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:09,219
You know, I support your
plan, Frank, in so far as it

289
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,688
insures that I won't have to
take care of you when you get

290
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,757
older, but you're going about
this all wrong, honestly.

291
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:14,758
How do you mean?

292
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,760
Well, for one thing,
she's in her apartment.

293
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,256
She's comfortable here.
She's on her home turf.

294
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,507
She's got all her amenities,
she feels good here.

295
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:21,956
She doesn't need you here.

296
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:23,925
You need to thrust her
into a hostile environment.

297
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,581
So that she needs you to protect her.

298
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:27,410
I should dump her under the bridge.

299
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,655
Dump her under the bridge? No,
don't dump her under the bridge.

300
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:30,445
What are you talking about?
No.

301
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,330
You need to be there, Frank.
That's the whole point.

302
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,113
Just take her to your apartment, OK?

303
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,443
Now, separately, if this is going to work,

304
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,795
she's gonna need to feel a little bit
more than just a tickle on her throat.

305
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,683
So if she's not feeling sick, well...

306
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:44,249
Then we're just have
to make her feel sick.

307
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,471
You're good.

308
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:47,491
Well, I'm a fixer,
Frank, is what.

309
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,225
You're good.

310
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:49,326
That's what I do.

311
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,662
Dennis, listen, we should
hang out more together.

312
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,630
Yeah.
Stop trying to bond with me.

313
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,457
They're not even
talking to each other.

314
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,459
My mom's not very verbal.

315
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,728
I know, but they haven't even
touched their cheesecake.

316
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,730
I mean, I feel like if you and I
were in a room with a perfectly

317
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,832
good cheesecake, all sorts
of conversation would start

318
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:15,867
happening.

319
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:18,269
Oh, Charlie, the funniest thing
happened today when I was

320
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,870
doing the laundry.

321
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,104
Mom, no, not me.

322
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,406
You got to talk to her, okay?

323
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:22,073
Don't talk to me.

324
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:24,242
Yeah, pretend like we're not
even here, Mrs. Kelly, okay?

325
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,043
Go gossip.

326
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:26,311
About what?

327
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,279
Maybe you were at a
supermarket one time, and you

328
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,449
met a cute guy, and you were
feeling saucy, and then you

329
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,651
wanted to go back and talk
to your friend, Sophia.

330
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,820
So you're like Blanche
and she's like Sophia.

331
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:36,521
So, go ahead.

332
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,256
I don't go to the supermarket.

333
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:39,824
The shopping carts are dangerous.

334
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,592
Shopping carts are not dangerous, Mom.

335
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:43,394
There's nothing dangerous
about a shopping cart!

336
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:44,362
Let's try a new tack.

337
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:45,363
Everybody, calm down.

338
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,364
This isn't working. Alright.

339
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,965
TV's going off. Boom.

340
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,567
Okay! That's good, right?

341
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,302
You guys are roommates now,
so maybe you can get to know

342
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,203
one another.

343
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:52,937
I'm hot.

344
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:53,638
My mom's hot.

345
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,639
I'm hot, too.

346
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,340
Okay, I got to be honest.

347
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm hot, as well.

348
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:56,941
Can we turn the fan on?

349
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:58,343
Okay, well, the fan is broken.

350
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,344
It hasn't worked for years.

351
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,379
Oh, oh, okay. That's good.

352
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,814
My mom's very good with her hands.

353
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:03,581
Maybe she can fix it.

354
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:04,382
Oh, yeah?

355
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,818
Mom was the manager at
Jiffy Lube for many years.

356
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,152
I never heard about this.

357
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,638
Yeah, well, she doesn't like to brag.
It's not her style.

358
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:12,185
Yeah, but she started at the bottom,

359
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:13,676
worked her way to the tippy top.

360
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,760
Yeah, there was just
three people working at Jiffy Lube.

361
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:16,761
It's not really a high climb.

362
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,730
Okay, well, please don't
diminish my mother's

363
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:19,564
achievements, okay?

364
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:21,499
Well, don't get too excited about
your mother's achievements.

365
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,067
Okay, could you...
Mom, do you want to take a look

366
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,736
at that fan, and see
if you can fix it?

367
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:26,871
Hmm.

368
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,405
What was that?

369
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:29,674
It means, "Not right now, but
there's a possibility that I

370
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:30,942
could get to it tomorrow."

371
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:32,877
See, the problem is, once that
sun goes down, you're not going

372
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,180
to get this woman to do anything
'cause she thrives on sunlight.

373
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:37,915
She seems like she's
never been in sunlight.

374
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,152
Oh!

375
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:41,819
That's nasty.

376
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,021
Oh, Charlie, she's spitting
into my porcelain.

377
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:45,356
Okay, well, that makes you mad.

378
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:46,591
Take it up with her!

379
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:47,959
Have a conversation with her.

380
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,161
Everybody, can we just...
Let's relax for a second.

381
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,630
Maybe I can get you, like, a...
Like, a beer bottle, would that

382
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,131
be okay?

383
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,365
An empty beer bottle to spit in?

384
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,366
Yeah?

385
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,868
Okay, having fun.

386
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,671
? Thank you for being a friend
Traveled down the road

387
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:06,644
and back again, the heart is true
you're a pal and confidante ?

388
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:08,045
Don't look at me.

389
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:10,114
? And if you threw a party ?

390
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:11,215
Turn your head.

391
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,484
? And invited everyone you knew ?

392
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,086
You see? There.

393
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,056
? You would see the biggest
gift would be from me

394
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:22,560
And the card attached would say... ?

395
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:24,683
Look at her!

396
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,505
She's zonked.

397
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:35,373
Oh, yeah.

398
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:36,307
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,443
Now, when she wakes up, she'll
be really, really cold,

400
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,944
so you just give her this blanket.

401
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,279
You know, get her some more juice.

402
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,413
You know, just be a dad to her.

403
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:43,481
Oh, this is so boring.

404
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,783
This is bullshit, I mean, God.

405
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,119
I mean, how long do I
have to do this for?

406
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,653
What do you mean?

407
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:50,087
We've been here for,
like, an hour, Frank.

408
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:50,988
You're the worst dad.

409
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,690
Groban!

410
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:53,691
She's up.

411
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:54,692
I'll come find you.

412
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:55,226
Okay.

413
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:55,927
Daddy's here.

414
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:56,761
Take it easy, honey.

415
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,229
Okay, honey, don't get up.

416
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,163
Stay right where you are.

417
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,065
Don't go by the knives.

418
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:02,967
Let me backstage.

419
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,635
I think she's going backstage.

420
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,503
Going backstage.

421
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:06,337
You sing so good.

422
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,638
Honey, honey, you want a blanky?

423
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,639
I'll swaddle you, baby.

424
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
I'll get to you.

425
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,475
No, no, tomorrow night.

426
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:12,977
You sing in my ears.

427
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:13,644
Where's she going?

428
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,112
She thinks she's going to the concert?

429
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,013
I don't know. She's walking.

430
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,682
She's, like, in a zombie state.

431
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,016
Ooh, she's going to
bounce off all the walls.

432
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,251
I've never seen anything like this.

433
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:21,118
It's incredible.

434
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,287
Outside. She's going out.

435
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,123
Ooh, she's going to
hit the skateboard.

436
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,308
Ooh.

437
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:31,410
Ah, did you see that? It's like Mr. Magoo.

438
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:38,402
Ooh.

439
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:39,337
Oh.

440
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,172
Magoo never made that mistake.

441
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,229
No.

442
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:46,677
One... Two... Three.

443
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:48,946
Good night, honey.

444
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:50,248
Good night, Mac.

445
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:51,115
One, two, three.

446
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,083
One, two, three.

447
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,451
One. Two. Three.

448
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:54,919
One, two, three.

449
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,420
One, two, three.

450
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,356
One, two, three...
Mrs. Kelly?

451
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,290
Yes?

452
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,125
Why are you doing
everything in threes?

453
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:04,095
Oh, so Charlie doesn't die.

454
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:05,863
What?

455
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,231
One, two, three.

456
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:08,833
One, two, three.

457
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,134
That's crazy.

458
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,135
Bat shit crazy.

459
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:12,136
I don't know what to do.

460
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,104
What do you want me to say?

461
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,639
The woman's out of her damn mind.

462
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,475
Hey! Get the hell...
Is she waking up my mom?

463
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:18,476
No!

464
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,477
No!

465
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:19,977
No, Mom!

466
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,712
My mom does not like to
be woken up, Mrs. Kelly!

467
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,447
Shit! Get out of my room.

468
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:24,549
Just one more. One more.

469
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,750
One, two, three.

470
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,119
Get out of here, goddamn it!

471
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:29,520
Whoa, whoa.

472
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:30,454
Mom, go to bed!

473
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:31,789
Oh, man, that was close.

474
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,324
Now you see where I
get my temper, huh?

475
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,091
Yeah, one, two, three.

476
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:34,825
One, two, three.

477
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:36,360
What are you doing?

478
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:36,994
Huh?

479
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:37,995
What was that?

480
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,463
Oh, you know, just playing it safe.

481
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:40,131
She's been doing it.

482
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:40,665
I'm still alive.

483
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,666
Can't be crazy.

484
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,667
Yeah, no, that's very crazy.

485
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,468
It does feel good to
do stuff in threes.

486
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:45,269
Okay, you know what?

487
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,971
I'm pulling the plug on this
whole thing, all right?

488
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:47,972
'Cause this and this?

489
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:48,706
This has got to stop.

490
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:49,373
Yeah you're right.

491
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:50,875
Tomorrow morning, I'm
getting my mom out of here.

492
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:51,642
Let's just go to bed.

493
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:52,944
Yeah, this has not
been a good situation.

494
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:53,544
Let's go to bed.

495
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,278
This one look off to you?

496
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:54,779
One, two, three.

497
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,469
No, it's fine. It's fine.

498
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,263
Hey, guys, we got some
bagels and coffee.

499
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:03,964
One, two, three.

500
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,611
*

501
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,369
There you go.

502
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:09,585
Oh, mom.

503
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,671
Uh, where's your chewing tobacco?

504
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,507
You know Mrs. Kelly
doesn't like the smoke.

505
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:16,009
Oh, the ceiling fan is going
to push all the smoke outside

506
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:16,903
the windows.

507
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,169
Oh, yeah?

508
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,280
Oh, she's fixing the fan?

509
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:22,449
See? I told you, dude...
My mom is very handy.

510
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,619
Oh. The Muslims are back.

511
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,355
Where do you think they're
coming and going from?

512
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:29,656
Damn foreigners!

513
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:32,926
They ain't American,
I don't want to know 'em.

514
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:33,660
I know.

515
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,129
I wish they'd all go
back to the desert.

516
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:36,997
Yeah!

517
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:38,632
So it does seem like
they're bonding, huh?

518
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah. I mean, it's not really
a Golden Girls type

519
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,203
conversation, it's, like, a
racist conversation, but...

520
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:46,273
Where the hell is my damn screwdriver?

521
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,275
I'm wiping all the germs off for you.

522
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:51,745
Quit cleaning my
damn tools and sit your ass

523
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,747
down!

524
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:56,783
Shit, dude, we might want to
even consider bringing Poppins

525
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,218
back into this mix.

526
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,686
It does seem to be working.

527
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,654
Like it?

528
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:02,122
Ooh! Yes, I do.

529
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,523
Please don't hit me.

530
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,858
I have sensitive skin.

531
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,060
Let's just find the dog, and
we'll talk about it there.

532
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,061
Okay, alright.

533
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,620
Let's just let them be, though, huh?

534
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,302
Mm. Mm, mm.

535
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,207
? ?

536
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,947
Good morning, sleepyhead.

537
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:27,948
What?

538
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:28,882
Yeah, you're all tied up.

539
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:29,716
It's for your own safety.

540
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,384
Yeah, you took a dinger
down the stairs.

541
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,152
Ooh, big-time.

542
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:33,286
You guys untie me right now!

543
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,689
Okay, I'll untie you if you
promise to remember that I took

544
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,638
care of you good.

545
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,059
Yeah, remember that, 'cause
Frank took really good care of

546
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,194
you, so you're gonna have
to take care of him.

547
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,295
What are you talking about?

548
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,865
I feel way worse now than I ever did.

549
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
What is going on with my face?!

550
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,168
It's the bedbugs.

551
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:48,835
Oh!

552
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,838
But that'll last a little while,
but it'll go away eventually.

553
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,906
Get the dog off me!

554
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,774
The dog stinks... Get the dog off me!

555
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,575
Fair enough, fair enough.

556
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,376
Poppins, let's go.

557
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,377
Come on, Poppins!

558
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,845
Hop up, Poppins, come on.

559
00:17:58,846 --> 00:17:59,779
Oh, whoa.

560
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,648
Oh, I think Poppins
got into the juice.

561
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:02,415
What?

562
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:02,983
Oh, no.

563
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:03,617
What juice?

564
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:04,284
Oh. He's ice-cold.

565
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,018
He's dead?

566
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,086
Yes! He's dead!

567
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:06,953
How is he dead?

568
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,421
Well, why would he be
dead from the juice?

569
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,656
We killed Poppins? Oh, shit!

570
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,558
Oh, my God, Mac's gonna
have a fit, dude.

571
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,760
I drank a lot of that juice...
I remember that very clearly!

572
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,929
I have an idea, Frank, I have an idea.

573
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,897
Fixer's always got a fix, right?

574
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,798
Yeah, what... Oh, this is gonna
work, this is a good idea.

575
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,733
Grab Poppins. Let's go. Come on.

576
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:20,233
Take the dog?

577
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:20,734
Grab the dog!

578
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:21,792
What was in the juice?

579
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:23,438
Hold on. before you go, untie me.

580
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,453
- Stay right there.
- No, guys!

581
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,407
You guys, I got Groban in the park.

582
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:28,441
I got a dead dog over here.

583
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,643
I got Groban in the park!

584
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:30,710
Untie me!

585
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,246
What was in the juice?

586
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:35,782
One, two, three.

587
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:36,883
One, two, three.

588
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,885
Charlie, I think you're right,
dude, I feel better about this.

589
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:39,886
More in control. Yeah.

590
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,221
Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

591
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,089
Yo, what's happening?

592
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,190
What's happening, guys?

593
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,192
Hey, I was just, uh...
We were hanging out, uh, in the

594
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,260
alley, going for some air.

595
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:48,295
What's going on?

596
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,095
Yeah.

597
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,163
What are you guys doing?

598
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:51,865
We're actually looking for Poppins.

599
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,501
Yeah, we're gonna bring him back
over to Charlie's mom's house.

600
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:55,435
They're gonna live together.

601
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:56,436
Poppins?

602
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,370
What happened to Poppins?

603
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,506
He w... He, uh...
You saw him.

604
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:02,309
- Yeah, I... might've been...
- Why are you guys acting so weird?

605
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,276
Yeah.

606
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,947
Why are... Why are you
looking at that trash can?

607
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:08,915
Uh, nothing special about it.

608
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,849
I don't know.

609
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,984
What was in that trash bag?

610
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:11,918
Poppins.

611
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,719
What?!

612
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,888
Well, he ate a lot of cold
medicine, and he croaked.

613
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,424
I'm sorry. He-he-he...
Yeah, he got into some cold

614
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:18,191
medicine. Sorry.

615
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,993
So you threw him in the trash?

616
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,862
Yeah, what are you gonna do,
send him to the moon? Right?

617
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,998
No, I want to have a
proper burial for him.

618
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:28,268
That seemed proper enough
for Poppins, you know?

619
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,003
Oh, no. He's fine.

620
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,137
What? He's fine?

621
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,606
Yeah, he's just in here
chowing down on a diaper.

622
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,443
Hey! Look at him.

623
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:40,780
But that dog was...
Come on. Hey, good boy.

624
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,282
That dog just does not die.

625
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:43,316
No, he does not.

626
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,250
Wow.

627
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,485
Oh, there he goes.

628
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:47,220
Ah.

629
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,622
Don't worry, guys, he will be back.

630
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,193
Yeah, well... Let's hope not.

631
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:55,195
Bon voyage, Poppins!

632
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,763
Have a good trip.

633
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:58,398
Back to the bar, or what?

634
00:19:58,399 --> 00:19:59,399
Yeah.

635
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,967
Yeah, sure, let's drink.

636
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:05,689
Yo, Frank, it's ***. have you seen Dee?

637
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,657
I'm backstage and ***
the party is pumping.

638
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:11,728
Look, if you see her biatch tell her
