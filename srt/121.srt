1
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:03,653
<i>Okay, gather round,
everybody, gather round.</i>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,054
<i>Gather round, please.</i>

3
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:06,856
<i>I have a, uh, a presentation.</i>

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,691
Now, because of everyone's
A.D.D., I know I'm gonna

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,326
lose your attention in
about three minutes,

6
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,794
- and, uh, Frank's gonna fall asleep.
- No way.

7
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,297
I slept 26 hours last night.

8
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:16,766
You still seem very sleepy.
Can I start my presentation?

9
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,302
Where's the easel?
No, no, I'm not using an easel-- don't interrupt.

10
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,270
You want me to go get the projector?
No, I don't want the projector.

11
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:23,139
And I don't want the easel.
What are you gonna point with?

12
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,640
Don't want whatever the
hell you're gonna say.

13
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,023
'Cause it's all gonna be old
and outdated, all right?

14
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,710
Let me start my presentation,
which is actually about that.

15
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,045
It's about innovation.

16
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,214
Not taking questions.
Goddamn.

17
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,082
Let me do my thing, okay?
Stop interrupting.

18
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,053
Okay, so, um, as we all know,
um, tomorrow is St. Paddy's Day,

19
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,788
traditionally our
most profitable day.

20
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:43,091
However, recently, profits
have been declining.

21
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,627
Every year.
And we need to change.

22
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,362
We need innovation.

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,997
We need to move Paddy's
from the past and into...

24
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:52,067
the future,
a mobile Paddy wagon.

25
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,769
Now, these days, people like
to have things on demand.

26
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:56,138
So instead of having
to go to a bar,

27
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,907
we will bring the bar to you.

28
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,343
Ooh, is that, like, a car
service type of thing?

29
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,278
Where we pick people up and
take 'em around from bar to bar

30
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:04,947
and jack up the prices?

31
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:06,748
That's actually a really good idea.
Uh, no.

32
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,583
The Paddy's wagon <i>is</i> the bar.

33
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,018
No, Dennis.

34
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,486
If we want to make money,

35
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:13,422
we need to honor ancient
Irish traditions,

36
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,191
like serving an irresponsible
amount of booze to people

37
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,126
who are genetically predisposed
to having alcohol problems.

38
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:19,461
- Right.
- You see,

39
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,929
St. Patrick started
that tradition,

40
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,297
and that's why we
celebrate him today.

41
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,732
Yeah... No, that's
not what he did.

42
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,701
No, he-he played
the flute for some kids,

43
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:27,602
and then he lured them
into a cave somewhere,

44
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,204
- and he diddled them.
- Nah.

45
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,707
You got him mixed up with the Pied Piper.
Right.

46
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:34,009
St. Patrick didn't
play the flute.

47
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,777
He drove the kids
out of Ireland.

48
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,279
And then he molested 'em.

49
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,514
No, no, if-if St. Patrick
molested kids,

50
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,149
he would be regarded as a scoundrel.
No, no, no.

51
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,552
I feel like, in the olden days
of the Catholic Church,

52
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,554
pedophiles were
regarded as heroes.

53
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:46,989
All right, all right,
look, g-guys, uh,

54
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,757
St. Patrick didn't do
any of that shit, okay?

55
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:49,825
He drove the snakes
out of Ireland.

56
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,259
Uh, I-I don't know
about all this.

57
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:52,561
I kind of want to just do
the traditional thing

58
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,129
of, like, sticking
around the bar

59
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,697
and-and trying to catch the leprechaun.
No, no!

60
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:57,366
No, we don't want to do a
leprechaun thing again.

61
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,368
Stop, stop, guys...
I'm gonna catch one.

62
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:01,036
I'm, like, this close.
You're not gonna catch him

63
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,771
because he doesn't exist.
Guys, please...

64
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,159
You know what...
I don't even know

65
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,640
if I've set up
my glue traps for him yet.

66
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,009
Charlie, enough
with the leprechaun!

67
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:08,677
I mean, can you believe him?
Okay, wait.

68
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,079
Who cares? Look, I'm trying to...
You know what,

69
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,981
actually-- I might
want to get myself a flute.

70
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,716
I was thinking the same thing.
We've been talking... you were?

71
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,418
Yeah, because I-I feel like
it's a really fun...

72
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,086
I know we're kind of old, but...
Go get a flute?

73
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:19,254
Go get a flute, yeah.
Go get... go get a flute!

74
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,989
Everybody go get a flute!

75
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,125
...in the sixth grade,
I feel like it's kind of simple.

76
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,826
Frank, look...

77
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,895
All right, let me
explain it to you, at least.

78
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,063
No, he's gone.

79
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,965
Okay.

80
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:48,662
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

81
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,251
So, Frank, here's the plan.

82
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:59,124
We're gonna fill the wagon
with hip, attractive clientele.

83
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,059
We're gonna use my streamlined
system to process drink orders.

84
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,460
We're gonna take photographs
with a retro filter

85
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,928
for the Web site.

86
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,864
And that will entice
future end users

87
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,866
to comment
and spread brand awareness

88
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,068
over various
social media platforms.

89
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,770
That seems insanely complicated.

90
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,805
Why don't we just take cash?

91
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:15,140
No, no, no, no. What I'm talking
about's way simpler than cash.

92
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,175
It's-it's streamlined.

93
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,377
I'm lost. It's... I'm
trying to explain it to you

94
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,246
and I feel like you're not
even listening. I-I...

95
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:23,281
Top o' the morning,
you filthy lads.

96
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,085
I'm fixing to have a whale of
a time in this here mobile pub.

97
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm so sorry-- what is this?

98
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,122
Crazy Paddy, you big, dumb arse.

99
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,824
Yeah. Why?

100
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,126
'Cause it's fun.
No.

101
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,062
I thought that's the thing
about St. Patrick's Day--

102
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,897
people want clownery and-and
they want to embrace

103
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,765
the Irish stereotypes. No, no, no.
This isn't innovative.

104
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,701
It's outdated and it's gonna
offend people.

105
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,970
Well, I brought my piece in case
anybody gets out of line. Oh, I...

106
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,639
Okay, Frank, Frank,
look-- no guns.

107
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,507
Let go.
No guns, no costumes.

108
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:51,643
Trust me, I got this.

109
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,445
Frank, you're gonna drive.
Drive.

110
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:54,846
Okay, Dee, you're
gonna serve drinks. In the back.

111
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,781
As a human being.
A real one.

112
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,982
Mm.
Guys,

113
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,950
I'm gonna provide...

114
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:00,251
the experience.

115
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,854
Ooh.

116
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:04,089
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, right?

117
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,557
Yeah, I like this. Nice.

118
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,625
I... See, I told you.
I know what I'm doing.

119
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,060
Come on, let's go.

120
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,562
Frank, you're driving.

121
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,864
Okay. Here we go.

122
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:20,505
Ho! Check it out, Mac--
got some cool stuff.

123
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:23,041
I got some green paint
and I found a snake.

124
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,677
Great. Why?

125
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,612
You know, the snakes, 'cause,
like, we... I don't remember

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,547
where we landed on St. Paddy,
but I remember snakes

127
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,783
were involved. And the green
paint's for the, uh, beer.

128
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:33,985
Okay, love the snake.
Great catch there.

129
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:36,020
But why not just use food
coloring for the beer?

130
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,489
Uh, 'cause beer's not a food.

131
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,190
When was the last time
you ate a beer?

132
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:40,778
When was the last time
you drank paint?

133
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:44,689
Have you been drinking paint?

134
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:47,799
No.

135
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,334
Let me see your tongue.

136
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,669
Oh, my God, dude!

137
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:54,939
Oh, that shit's just disgusting!
It's not bad.

138
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,041
You... you can't drink paint. I know.
I hear you, I hear you.

139
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,043
You say that, but I don't think
that you're gonna stop.

140
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:01,079
Yeah, I get it, though, man.
It's, uh... Right.

141
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,448
I-I feel like you're saying you
get it, but you don't get it.

142
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,016
It's cool.
It's not cool.

143
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,251
It is what it is.
Oh, my God,

144
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:07,619
this is so frustrating!
Look,

145
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,087
I'm gonna go down
to the basement

146
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,356
and I'm gonna check
out my glue traps

147
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,724
and see if I, you know, got a leprechaun
in there. Wait, no, no, no, no.

148
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,260
What... We said
no leprechaun this year.

149
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,095
You're not chasing leprechauns.

150
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:18,930
I know, and I kind of forgot
where we landed on that.

151
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:21,266
I got these great cookie sheets,
they're filled with glue, so...

152
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,334
But I-I hear you,
I hear you.

153
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:25,036
It's a frustrating thing.
It's like the guy doesn't

154
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,938
listen to us, man, when we're
trying to get through to him.

155
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,373
It's a bummer.

156
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:34,345
No, not you.
Keep moving, let's go,

157
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,347
come on.
You kidding me?

158
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:40,051
Oh, oh, h-hey-hey,
there, fellas.

159
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,786
What's going on?
Where you going? You know what?

160
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:44,022
Don't answer that.
Because I already know.

161
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,790
You're going for a ride
in the Paddy's Wagon.

162
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,226
Oh, cool. Is this,
like, a car service thing?

163
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,894
Hey, can you take us
to Center City?

164
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:52,163
No, it's not a goddamn car
service. Why does everyone...

165
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,465
You get in that
wagon right now or I'm gonna

166
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,401
sock you a good one
right in the kisser!

167
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:58,636
Yeah, you dumb bi...

168
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:00,838
What the hell are you doing?
Uh, just innovating.

169
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,607
I took the Paddy's wig
and I cut it

170
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,475
into an awesome beard.
Great new character. No.

171
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,510
Hilarious.
You've just created another

172
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,312
offensive Irish stereotype, Dee.

173
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,347
The Fighting Irish--
I-it's true.

174
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,448
I mean, that's what Irish people do.
That is not what...

175
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:12,083
They get drunk,
they fight people.

176
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:13,117
All right, I'm trying to give
these guys... Look, guys,

177
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,619
don't pay attention to her.

178
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,054
I-I want to give you
an authentic, um, uh,

179
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,789
once-in-a-lifetime
experience here.

180
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,024
Oh. Oh, wait, so is
this, like, a bang bus?

181
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,026
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not a bang bus, okay?

182
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:23,628
Look... Just get in the wagon,

183
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,296
I'll give you a ride
to Center City.

184
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,198
Get in.

185
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,303
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

186
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,505
let me walk you through how
our simple business works.

187
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:36,007
God, take it easy, Frank!

188
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:38,176
Don't tell me
how to drive, you bitch.

189
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,812
Let... Let's keep it light for
the customers, all right, Frank?

190
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,181
As I was saying, fellas,
uh, what you're gonna

191
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:44,609
need to do is you,
uh, you're gonna

192
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,850
take a picture of this QR code,

193
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,518
you're gonna download the app,

194
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,520
log in using Facebook,
and you're gonna watch

195
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,589
a-a brief, 30-second
advertisement.

196
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,891
And then once we receive
your online order,

197
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,493
you will promptly
be served a beer.

198
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,929
Can't I just pay you cash?
That's what I... Yeah.

199
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,230
Well, no, cash is the way

200
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:00,632
that antiquated
companies do business.

201
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,066
Yeah, I just want a beer.
I don't really

202
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,468
want you to have
all my personal information.

203
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:04,836
A beer.
Just want a beer.

204
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,170
Don't want you to have my...

205
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,672
Yeah.

206
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,274
Look, man, um, if I
just gave you a beer,

207
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,708
and you just gave me cash,

208
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:12,176
then you wouldn't
be able to experience

209
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:13,778
everything that we've
got to offer here, okay?

210
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,314
Look, I'll show you. This...
Let me just pull up my...

211
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,349
I got a little presentation
here that I put together.

212
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,119
But, uh, can't get the goddamn
thing to... to go online.

213
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:23,154
I don't have a signal here.
Goddamn it. You know what?

214
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,462
Dee, uh, why don't you just
give him a couple free beers?

215
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:26,958
We'll-we'll call
'em "freemiums."

216
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,786
Don't know if you're
familiar with that term.

217
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,696
This is like all foam.
Dee, you goddamn bitch!

218
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,204
Hey! Oh, this thing's
bouncing around

219
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:34,766
like a pinball.
Don't blame me.

220
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,234
Keep it light,
you bitch!

221
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,802
All right.
Yeah, this is weird to me.

222
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,637
Can we just get out here?

223
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:42,640
Hey, it's locked.
Can you guys let us out?

224
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,210
No, I'm not gonna let you out. Screw this.
I'm calling the cops.

225
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:48,179
Why would you call the cops?
We're just hanging out, man!

226
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:49,747
All right, stop, stop, stop.

227
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:51,582
All right, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh. Push "end." End.

228
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,585
Give the
phones to the girl.

229
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,788
Let's go, guys. I don't want
to have to do this shit.

230
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:59,457
Frank, we got to
pivot the business.

231
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,392
Mm-hmm.

232
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,694
Come on, get the hell out.
Everybody out.

233
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,362
Out, out, out, out,
out, out, out, out.

234
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,264
All right.

235
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,965
Don't worry. We're gonna mail
your phones back to you, but

236
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,635
we're gonna need your addresses,
so fork over your I.D.'s.

237
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,236
Let's go. Come on.
And their money.

238
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,638
We can't have 'em
cabbing it back to the city

239
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,173
and going straight to the cops.

240
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,840
Goddamn it.
That's a good point.

241
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,643
Okay, you know what?
Dee, collect their wallets.

242
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,911
Don't worry, guys.
We're not thieves.

243
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:21,346
You'll get your
wallets back, too.

244
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,614
Yeah. Don't be babies.
All right, uh,

245
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:25,083
come on, come on, guys,
let's go, let's go.

246
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,417
Let's go.
Shut the doors.

247
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,193
Did we just kidnap
and rob those guys?

248
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,195
We just drove the
snakes out of Philly,

249
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:38,763
the way St. Patrick did.

250
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,365
Oh!

251
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,666
So, what you're saying is,

252
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,468
technically, we gave those guys

253
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,636
a very authentic
St. Patty's Day experience.

254
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,105
Oh.
Yeah.

255
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:48,539
Nice.
In a way.

256
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:50,174
Oh. All right.

257
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:52,343
That's good. That's good. Yeah.

258
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:00,107
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Here.

259
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:01,916
Jesus Christ, where's Charlie?

260
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:05,583
Hey, Mac, somebody stole my damn wallet.
What?!

261
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,418
Beat it! Beat it, Mauricio!
I need to talk to Mac.

262
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,886
Charlie, where have
you been, dude?

263
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,533
I can't run the bar by myself
and do security.

264
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:12,920
People are getting
their wallets stolen.

265
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,488
Okay, uh, look, just come

266
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:16,157
to the basement with me,
like, really quick.

267
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,425
Goddamn it! All right.

268
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:18,492
Attention, everybody.

269
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:19,894
Irish honor system.

270
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,962
Please serve yourselves.

271
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,665
Put the money in the bucket.
Thank you.

272
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,801
Uh, I don't think the Irish
honor system's a thing, man.

273
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:27,902
Oh, it's a thing.

274
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:28,803
It's an ancient Irish tradition.

275
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,237
Know your history, bro.

276
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,705
What could possibly
be so important?

277
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:35,576
Charlie...

278
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,445
what the hell am I looking at?

279
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:40,981
I caught him.

280
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,017
Wake up that son of a bitch.

281
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,218
Dude, I think you've
kidnapped a little person.

282
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,953
Huh?

283
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,222
Nah... nah, nah.
First of all,

284
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,824
I've captured
a leprechaun, okay?

285
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,731
You wouldn't say,
"I kidnapped Bigfoot," right?

286
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,494
You'd say,
"I captured Bigfoot."

287
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,896
Well, that may be true,
but leprechauns aren't real.

288
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:57,364
So what we're dealing with here

289
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,966
is a little person
in a glue trap.

290
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:00,468
Yeah, I thought about that,
ruled it out, okay?

291
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:01,936
'Cause the basement door
is locked, so unless

292
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,637
he's a being
who's unrestrained by the laws

293
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,639
of the physical world,
he's not getting down here, man.

294
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:07,074
Dude, if he is a human being,

295
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:08,876
he's going to sue
the shit out of us.

296
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,704
If he's a leprechaun,
he's got a pot of gold.

297
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:11,979
Yeah...

298
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,314
Well, yeah,
that's... No, no.

299
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,448
Well, let's not rule
one out over the other.

300
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:15,916
I mean, it's very weird

301
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,184
that he's down here, right?

302
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:18,886
Okay. Let's ask him.

303
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:22,523
Uh, sir, I'm gonna ask
you a direct question.

304
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,494
Are you now or have you
ever been a leprechaun?

305
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:29,063
No, I'm not
a goddamn leprechaun!

306
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,531
Please... It was
pretty convincing.

307
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,366
Are you kidding me?

308
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,594
If he's a leprechaun, that's
what he has to say, right?

309
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,905
Sir, why are you
dressed like a leprechaun?

310
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,441
'Cause it's St. Paddy's Day,
you idiots!

311
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,943
- This guy's good. He's good.
- Yeah.

312
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,078
Nasty little son of a bitch,
isn't he? You think?

313
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,080
There's, like,
a real bite to him.

314
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,115
I know. You know what
I think we should do?

315
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,817
We just rough him
up a little bit.

316
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:51,318
You know, just get the truth
out of him, just a little bit.

317
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:53,654
It's a great idea.

318
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,589
We don't want to bruise him up.
Yeah.

319
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:58,125
You know, so, I just wish we
had, like, a hose or something.

320
00:10:58,193 --> 00:10:59,593
Yeah. You know, we could
blast the truth out of him.

321
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:01,495
Right?
That'd be good...

322
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:03,797
Oh, shit.
There's a hose right here.

323
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,103
I... I don't ever remember
a hose being down here, do you?

324
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,905
No. I don't know.
Dude...

325
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,473
do you realize
what just happened?

326
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,109
You made a wish, which
the leprechaun clearly granted.

327
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,310
You know, everyone knows,
you capture a leprechaun,

328
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,178
you get three wishes, right?

329
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:20,447
So we got to think very carefully
what our next two are here.

330
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,550
I wish I could live forever?
What are you doing?!

331
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:24,318
I wish you don't. How about that?
No, no! Why did you do that?

332
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:25,319
Why did<i> you</i> do that?
Why didn't you say,

333
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,288
"I wish I could live forever."?

334
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,056
And live forever with you?!
Well...

335
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,758
Look, I'm not a leprechaun!

336
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,760
Just let me out of here,
you dickheads!

337
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:34,261
Ah. Wish there was a way

338
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,563
we could just know
for sure, you know.

339
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,731
Charlie?

340
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,868
Get the snake.

341
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:43,971
<i>The problem was, Frank...</i>

342
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,074
that last group of belligerent
hooligans just didn't understand

343
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:48,509
how to experience
our business properly,

344
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,978
but I think this new group
is gonna get it.

345
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:54,381
Plus, they're physically weaker,

346
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,317
in case anything goes wrong.

347
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,985
What's happening?

348
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,053
I'll tell ya what's happenin'.

349
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,022
One day you're young and pretty,

350
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,692
and the next, the years
of drinking and abuse

351
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,894
have robbed you of your youth.

352
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:09,229
Abuse? Did these
guys hurt you?

353
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:10,431
No!

354
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:12,566
Me husband did this to me.

355
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,535
Arrr!

356
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:15,736
Dee...
Mm?

357
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:17,037
What the hell are you doing?

358
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,505
What are you...?
What, are you a pirate?

359
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:19,840
I can't tell if you're
doing a thing now,

360
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:20,841
or if this is just
who you've become.

361
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:21,875
I've giving them

362
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,310
an authentic Irish experience,

363
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:24,878
like you were begging for
before...

364
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,480
You're giving them a
completely inauthentic,

365
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:28,115
frightening experience,
and you're scaring them.

366
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:30,217
Okay, listen, ladies,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

367
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,418
Will you just let us out,
please?

368
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:32,886
Well, no.

369
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:34,288
No, I'm not gonna let you out.

370
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:35,756
I need you to
experience everything

371
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:37,157
I-I have to offer,
okay, so you're...

372
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,626
Rahr!
So, experience... Dee!

373
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,561
Shut up!

374
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,064
All right, look, we're gonna
have a good time here, okay?

375
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,733
You're experiencing some
free beers right now

376
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,434
because I can't get the
goddamn Internet to work.

377
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,637
That's a problem for me.
Do you guys know how to use

378
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,372
tablet computers? You're young.
No.

379
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,940
I just want to connect the
goddamn thing to the Internet.

380
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,241
They told me it'd be easy.
It's not, though.

381
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,043
Okay. Well, I'll
tell you what.

382
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:58,345
I'll let you out after I take
a couple photographs of you.

383
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,947
How's that sound? Yeah?
Take some photographs

384
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:02,716
for my... for my Web site?
So, look happy.

385
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,652
Look like you're having fun.
No need to cover those up.

386
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,120
My customers like those.
They're like me.

387
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,155
They're gonna want to see that.

388
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,663
Yeah, okay, so smiling
smiling and...

389
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:12,960
You're not convincing me.
Smile!

390
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,294
Oh, damn!

391
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:15,796
This is not
supposed to be scary.

392
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,931
This is supposed to be an
authentic, fun time for you.

393
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,134
Yeah, all right, well,

394
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,702
I need to buy it, okay?

395
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,370
I'm...
Please let us out.

396
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,506
I don't want to be on
your weird Web site. Shh.

397
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,241
Well, if you don't comply with
me, then you're gonna end up

398
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,410
on the weird one, okay?
So, smile.

399
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,812
Ugh! All right.

400
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,980
You know what?
This isn't gonna work.

401
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:34,715
All right, come on, come on.

402
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,216
Let's go. Come on.

403
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,452
All right, out you go, ladies.
Out you go.

404
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,953
I know you didn't
threaten to call the cops,

405
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,422
but you would have--
I'm certain of it--

406
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:42,823
so I'm gonna need
your wallets and your phones.

407
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:44,658
Give 'em to the girl.

408
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,760
Oh, yeah, I'm probably gonna
pop on your Twitter accounts,

409
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:49,296
just so you know. Write us some,
uh, enthusiastic reviews,

410
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:50,731
which you would have done,
as well,

411
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,066
had you experienced
our business properly,

412
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,534
but you decided to be...

413
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,636
All right, well...

414
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:03,243
Talk, bitch! I'm blasting you! Come on!
Talk! Come on, leprechaun!

415
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:05,231
Come on, leprechaun, admit it!
Where's the gold?!

416
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,181
Aw, what's the point, dude?
There's no water pressure.

417
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:08,949
I feel like I'm giving him a baby bath.
Yeah, I know.

418
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,517
Snake's not working either, man.

419
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,319
Well, that's
because the snake is dead.

420
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,054
Because you put it in a plastic
bag and it couldn't breathe.

421
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:15,289
All right, doesn't matter.
He probably killed it

422
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,391
with his leprechaun
magic, anyway.

423
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,793
I'm not a leprechaun,
you goddamn assholes!

424
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,762
Yeah, yeah, guy. How are we
gonna get his pot of gold

425
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,997
if he won't even admit to us
that he's a leprechaun?

426
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,866
I mean, if this guy would
just admit he was a leprechaun,

427
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:27,301
we could be done with this whole mess.
Well, yeah.

428
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,103
- Of course.
- Okay, fine, you got me.

429
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,038
I'm a leprechaun.
I admit it.

430
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:32,906
What?

431
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:34,708
God... I am a... I'm a...

432
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:37,578
damn... a... I'm a leprechaun.

433
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,613
Yeah, right, but you don't
have the accent, That's...

434
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,782
and that's throwing me off, right?
It's throwing me off.

435
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,119
I live in a faraway land,

436
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,520
and I was transported here

437
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:50,557
by a giant magical rainbow.

438
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,527
And you never got me
Lucky Charms.

439
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,963
Oh!
That's it! That's it!

440
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,066
You were right! Dude! You caught a
leprechaun! I told you, man! I knew it!

441
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,834
Hey, can you let me go now?

442
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,503
No, you can't go. You know...
No. No.

443
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,250
we need your pot of gold.
Where is it? Yeah.

444
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:08,008
It's at the bottom
of the rainbow.

445
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,244
Hmm. Must be some sort
of leprechaun riddle,

446
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,212
'cause there's no
rainbows out today.

447
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,849
No, dude... I don't think
this guy's talking in metaphors.

448
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,285
I think he means exactly
what he's saying. Yeah?

449
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:19,953
Dude, he's talking
about that gay bar

450
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:21,755
down on Locust Street--
the Rainbow.

451
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,257
You know which one I'm
talking about, right? No.

452
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:25,092
Right. I'm gonna go
check it out, alone.

453
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,326
Why?

454
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:27,728
Well, because you'll be here.

455
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,329
And if, uh, the gang comes back,

456
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:32,332
they'll also be here,
and I'll be there, alone.

457
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,333
Right.

458
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,335
But you'll be here.

459
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:36,503
Great.
Great.

460
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,438
All right, you go do that,
Okay. Yeah.

461
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,140
and, uh, remember, you're there
to look for a pot of gold.

462
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,176
Okay. Alone.

463
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:43,610
Yeah. You'll be there, alone.

464
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:45,512
Okay!
Got it.

465
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,349
All right, well, that
just leaves you and me, and, uh,

466
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:52,519
we both know there's no pot
of gold at that gay bar.

467
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,855
So the question is...

468
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:58,926
what to do with the little liar.

469
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,967
We haven't made
a goddamn penny today.

470
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:09,002
We actually lost money,

471
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,505
with all the gas we burned
going back and forth.

472
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:13,507
Yeah, well, it's not my fault.
The business model's flawless.

473
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:15,242
If you knew how to drive
and you knew how to serve

474
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,611
a goddamn beer, we wouldn't
be in this mess.

475
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,047
Hmm.

476
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,382
All right. Mmm.

477
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,419
Okay, everybody out.
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

478
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,521
Go, go, go, go, go. You guys
are in the wrong demographic.

479
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:28,822
Where have you taken us?

480
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,291
Right. Yeah, I guess, uh,

481
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:34,294
we got so used to our routine of
picking people up and dropping

482
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,496
'em off outside of town
that we never even tried

483
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:39,700
to sell you people beer, did we?
They're too old, anyway.

484
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,702
Who's gonna watch 'em on a Web site?
That's true.

485
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,171
Yeah, you guys are a little too old
for our, uh...

486
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,174
So... Wallets and phones.
You know the drill.

487
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,479
I don't know why we don't
just do the car service thing.

488
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:55,382
People seem to be really needing
rides all over the town.

489
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,951
No, you know, that idea may work.
You think so?

490
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,053
Thank you.
You're welcome.

491
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:03,056
Oh. B-But before we
pivot to that one,

492
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:05,392
um, Deandra,
you mind, uh, jumpin' out

493
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,161
to see about the gas cap?
I think I left it off.

494
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,830
Yeah. Oop.

495
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:16,370
Oh! Hey!

496
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,372
Oh, goddamn!

497
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,240
Goddamn it...!

498
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,445
What you did there, Frank, that's, like...
Very funny. Yeah. That bitch

499
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,514
was dragging us down.
Yeah.

500
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,349
She was driving me crazy, man.
Oh.

501
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,919
Oh... shit.
What?

502
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,353
She didn't put the gas cap on.

503
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:36,023
Oh, is it open for real?
Big-time.

504
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,457
Oh, shit. Yeah, let me
grab that real quick.

505
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,059
I got it.

506
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:42,629
No, no, no, no, n...
Aw, goddamn!

507
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,610
I can't believe Uber jacks up their
prices just because it's a holiday.

508
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,997
That's unbelie... It's a scam.

509
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,965
We should have been doing
that the entire time.

510
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,101
Are you kidding me?
That was my whole idea.

511
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,670
Dee, stop trying to take
credit for everything. Wait--

512
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,083
what is going on in here?
Weren't Mac and Charlie

513
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,063
taking care of the bar?
Yeah, they were.

514
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,971
- Why is the bar empty?
- It ain't empty.

515
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:20,141
What are you doing back here,
you piece of shit?

516
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,509
It's a long story.
The business hit a wall,

517
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:26,080
went up in smoke,
and then went under.

518
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,915
Why are you speaking
in metaphors?

519
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,784
It ain't a metaphor.
I fell asleep,

520
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:33,354
crashed into a wall,
the engine burst into flames,

521
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,323
and I had to drive it into a river.
Right.

522
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,926
What the hell is that?

523
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,828
♪ ...to keep this smile
from my face ♪

524
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,563
♪ Listen, Tony ♪

525
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,833
♪ I'm all over the place ♪

526
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:49,103

jokers to the right ♪

527
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,105
♪ Here I am, stuck in
the middle with you... ♪

528
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,142
Well, you may be a man.

529
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:56,044
You may be a leprechaun.

530
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:58,579
But only one thing's for sure:

531
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,081
You're in the wrong basement.

532
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,116
Goddamn it! No!

533
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,453
I'm gonna see if you bleed green.
No! No! No, no, no!

534
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie, Charlie,
what the hell is... Whoa, whoa. Hey!

535
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,590
What are you doing?

536
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:12,026
What does
it look like I'm doing?

537
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:13,661
It looks like you've tied
a little person to a chair

538
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,563
and you're gonna torture him.

539
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:17,899
No, I've tied
a leprechaun to a chair,

540
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:20,868
and, uh, yeah,
I was gonna cut him to pieces.

541
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,538
Charlie...

542
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:24,806
you been drinking
straight paint?

543
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,240
Yeah.

544
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:27,475
Charlie, he's
not a leprechaun!

545
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,910
Do not hurt him!
I repeat:

546
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,245
he is not a leprechaun!
Oh, hey.

547
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,748
What is this?
Why are you covered in glitter?

548
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,183
I would love to answer
all of your questions,

549
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,085
but there is no time.

550
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:39,587
You see, I went to the Rainbow
to look for a pot of gold.

551
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:40,588
The gay bar?
Oh.

552
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:42,023
Again, no questions.

553
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:43,558
And when I got back,

554
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,561
I found this bag...
full of wallets,

555
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:48,196
hidden where we keep the towels.

556
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,263
Why did you need towels?

557
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,332
Not answering questions, okay?

558
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,036
Because apparently this son
of a bitch is a pickpocket.

559
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:56,904
That's why he's been
lurking around Paddy's.

560
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh! Well, that makes a lot
of sense, 'cause he kept saying,

561
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:01,943
like, "I'm a pickpocket. I'm
a pickpocket. Stop hurting me.

562
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,611
I'm not a leprechaun." And
I just thought that was, like,

563
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,414
a metaphor for, you know,
"I-I am a leprechaun."

564
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:08,015
This little son of a bitch
has been picking pockets

565
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,584
at our bar
every St. Paddy's Day

566
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:11,052
- for years.
- Well, we got a whole bag

567
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,554
full of wallets and phones, too.

568
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:16,290
You did? That's good. Because the
bar did not do so great. Yeah.

569
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,726
Turns out the Irish honor
system, that's not a thing.

570
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,194
Yeah, we were gonna
actually return the wallets

571
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,496
that we got, but, uh, Yeah.

572
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:22,964
since no one seems to be...

573
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:24,499
being honorable, uh,
maybe we keep our wallets

574
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,000
and those and, you know, Yeah.

575
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,769
chalk it up as a win. Yeah.
Oh, the luck of the Irish.

576
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:30,905
Let's not make
it a tradition, though.

577
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:32,807
Sure. Yeah, probably
better not to.

578
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,577
All right, well, what do we do
with this piece of shit?

579
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,826
Oh, shit, that leprechaun
just flew up a rainbow!

580
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:01,545
Stop drinking paint, Charlie.
Huh.

581
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:06,389
