1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,129
[Charlie] Now keep in mind,

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,799
we've been locked in this parking garage
stairwell for, like, 20 minutes, dude.

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,801
Okay, so then we turn
around, and what do we see?

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,221
A scary homeless dude. And I'm, like, "Oh, shit!
" Yeah! And I'm like, uh...

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,598
You know- I'm like, "What do we-
What do we do?" You know?

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,143
And then Mac, he's just like, "Just chill.
" And I'm like, "How do we chill, dude?"

7
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,104
Yeah. And I'm all, "Oh, shit!
He's gonna talk now!"

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,439
Yeah. And I'm all like, "How do
you know he's gonna talk, bro?"

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,025
And I'm like, "Because his mouth is opening.
" And then he did talk.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,611
Yeah. And then he goes- he goes, "I'll
let you out of the stairwell...

11
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,949
'cause I have the key, because
I'm the security guard instead."

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,244
That's a cool story, huh?
Yeah, right?

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,829
Okay, so, uh...

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,998
Just so I'm clear on the story
that you just told. Yeah.

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:46,003
It was about you guys getting locked in a
garage stairwell for 20 or so minutes.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,588
Yeah. And then a security
guard came along...

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,632
and the security guard
let you out.

18
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,217
Well, yeah. But...

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,469
I mean, it's how you tell the
story that makes it good.

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,472
How you told the story
was by far the worst part of the story.

21
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,890
You weren't even
paying attention to us, dude.

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,600
All you were doing
was playing on that stupid phone.

23
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,769
Why are you rubbing on the phone?
Let me rub on it.

24
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,105
What are you doing?
No, no, no! Hey, hey, Frank!

25
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,191
Get your greasy, fat, sausage fingers
of my touch screen phone.

26
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,901
This thing's new.
My fingers are not greasy.

27
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,321
Uh, you have four sausage links
in your pocket right now.

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,532
Yeah, but I don't touch
the sausage links.

29
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,828
Why should I do that when I can
let my shirt do the work? Watch.

30
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,122
Hmm. No touching, and warm.
[Scoffs] My God. You're an animal.

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,792
Guess what, boners. I just got a part in an M.
Night Shyamalan movie.

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,919
- What?
- Yeah. I'm a featured actress,

33
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,963
which means I'm gonna be
featured in a scene.

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,591
What's an M. Night?
Wow. Gross.

35
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,010
M. Night Shyamalan, the
Indian filmmaker from Philly.

36
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,053
Oh, my God.
This dude's a big deal, Frank.

37
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,514
He's like a true-to-life Slumdog Millionaire.
You know what I mean?

38
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,601
He always puts some awesome twists at the
end of his movies to trick the audience.

39
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,269
Oh, yeah, yeah,
like in The Sixth Sense.

40
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,272
You find out that the dude in
that hairpiece the whole time...

41
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,484
- That's Bruce Willis- the whole movie.
- That's not the twist.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,152
That's not the twist to that movie.
That wasn't?

43
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,612
No.
I'll tell you about it later.

44
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,781
There were a lot of twists in that movie.
Watch it again.

45
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,824
You know what? You're gonna
need a very crafty agent...

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,744
to squeeze everything
out of this slumdog.

47
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,454
I volunteer.
And I decline.

48
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,206
You are abusive
and you smell like warm meat...

49
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,792
and I want you to leave me alone 'cause
this is really important for me.

50
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,418
This is important
for all of us, okay?

51
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,129
This is an opportunity for Charlie
and I to get M. Night our script.

52
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,048
Right. Since when do you
and Charlie have a script?

53
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,551
Since you walked in here and said you were
in that movie. We're great storytellers.

54
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,179
No, goddamn it! No, come on.
Don't involve yourselves in this.

55
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,516
Dee, you involved us in this the second you
walked in and told us about the movie.

56
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,518
You really shouldn't have done that.
Let's get to work!

57
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,769
Oh, oh, hoo!

58
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,270
Let's get some beer. Dude.
Yeah!

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,144
Goddamn it.

60
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,063
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
Can I help you?

61
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,191
Oh, great. Nonfat, sugar free,
vanilla soy latte. Three shots, no foam.

62
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,069
Also, why don't you let me in here
so I can start my vocal warm-ups?

63
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm sorry. Who are you again?
Dee Reynolds, featured actress.

64
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,698
Reynolds?
Yeah.

65
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,366
And could you send
M. Night over also,

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,160
because I have a couple questions
regarding the detes of my character.

67
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,413
Right. Says you're a featured extra.
[Clicks Tongue]

68
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,416
Okay. Well, featured extra, featured actress.
What's the difference?

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,167
Well, the difference is...

70
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,421
a featured actress usually auditions for
the role, has lines, gets a trailer,

71
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,299
whereas a featured extra is a person
whose head shot we pull off a pile,

72
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,093
has no lines and sits in that tent
over there till we're ready for her.

73
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,387
Okay? Mmm. Okay.
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

74
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,640
Where are we on
the coffee situation,

75
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,059
because it's early
and I am hungover.

76
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,811
Go sit in the tent. Now.
This tent?

77
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,479
That one. Thank you.
Are you sure?

78
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,482
[Charlie] This is hard.
Mmm.

79
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,528
I mean, because I want the movie to be big,
you know, and, like, a box office smash...

80
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,323
and we want to put, like,
a lot of meat in the seats, you know?

81
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,575
Yeah. You know what I'm thinking, dude?
You know what I'm thinking?

82
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,161
Something that's happening in
Hollywood that's, like, pretty cool.

83
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,830
They take an underrated actor,
right, whose career is in a slump,

84
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,498
and then they make him
a star again.

85
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,792
Oh, that is awesome, right?
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah.

86
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,212
Yeah. So, who is the most
underrated actor of all time?

87
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,006
- It's Dolph Lundgren.
- Correct. Why?

88
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,676
Well, because of his spiky hair, his
ice-cold demeanor and his big muscles.

89
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,054
Absolutely. Okay. All right.
All right, so we have our actor.

90
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,723
- Okay. - That's great.
Now we need a really great role for him.

91
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,184
Oh, you know what I was thinking?
Scientists are cool.

92
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,685
What if he's a scientist?

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,772
Okay, okay. A muscular scientist.
I'm into that. Right.

94
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,775
As long as we don't cover up that
body with a lab coat, bro. No, dude.

95
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,944
He's wearing, like,
a hot mesh tank top.

96
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,488
I like that. Now does he,
like, fight crime or something?

97
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:45,242
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He fights crime,
uh, with his brain and his brawn.

98
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,119
Should we be writing this down?
Let's get all this down.

99
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,663
[Laughing] All right.
This is good. All right.

100
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,082
Okay. Brains-
Brawn...

101
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,541
Brawn-
Muscles...

102
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,337
Oh! Dude!
Yeah?

103
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,631
I just got a Shyamalan twist
to put in this bad boy.

104
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,216
Okay. Lay it on me.

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,761
What if this scientist
runs around on all fours?

106
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,638
Why would he run on all fours?

107
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,017
It's a science experiment with a
dog that goes absolutely haywire.

108
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:15,147
Suddenly he wakes up with the ability
to run around like a hound. You know?

109
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,859
We're not making the lead of our
big-budget action movie half dog!

110
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,903
No, not half dog. He's all dog.

111
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,365
Then why are we casting
Dolph Lundgren?

112
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,825
That will be the twist.

113
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,120
Dolph Lundgren will be
the voice of this dog.

114
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,831
That's not a twist!
That's a completely different movie...

115
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,750
about a talking-dog scientist
with the voice of Dolph Lundgren!

116
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,669
All right. You know what?
Check this out.

117
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,006
What if it's a man with a few dog-like qualities,
like, uh, heightened sense of smell...

118
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,717
Jesus Christ, Charlie.
We're not- There's no- or licking...

119
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,885
Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
A heightened sense of smell?

120
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,430
What if he can smell crime?

121
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,891
What if he smells crime?

122
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,351
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude!
Yeah?

123
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,438
What if he can smell a crime
before it even happens?

124
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,607
Holy shit, dude. That's amazing.
Smells crime before it even happens!

125
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,109
Yes, dude!

126
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,612
We're getting somewhere.
What if his entire head is just one big nose?

127
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,157
Write that down!
I like that!

128
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,909
He's one big nose
on Dolph Lundgren's body.

129
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,578
Oh, shit!

130
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,083
Ho!
What?

131
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,420
No. No, no, no, no, no.
What are you two doing here?

132
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,048
Well, since you've declined
my offer to be your agent,

133
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,800
I've since taken on Dennis
as a client.

134
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,678
Dennis has that
"I don't give a shit" attitude,

135
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,513
which is perfect for
Hollywood, right, Dennis?

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,515
I-I- I really don't care.
See? See?

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,309
Why do you want to be
everybody's agent?

138
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
Because that's where the money is.
What do you do?

139
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,230
You just put things together.
You sit back, you collect 10%...

140
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,899
and you let the client
do all the work.

141
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,358
Dennis doesn't give a shit.
Right?

142
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,444
Stop talking to me.
Perfect.

143
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,072
Okay. Well, you can't just walk in
here and get a part in the movie.

144
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,448
It's not how it works.

145
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,033
Excuse me, sir?
Yes?

with that.

But there is one critical
element that's missing.

210
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,589
It needs a sexual punch-up.

211
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,549

too, in their own kind of way, you know?

291
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,896
Great. How'd you like to be
in the movie business?

We're ready.

Well, I'm okay, but I feel like maybe
they used a little too much blood.

Let's go. Let's go.

they went a little overboard.

Yeah. It's perfect.

a husband for the shot. - Husband?

00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,956
Yeah.
How about this guy right here?

Wow. I could barely tell
that was you.

into the blood? - That's ridiculous.

That looks so stupid.

with me, so you could see my face.

did you manage that?

00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,368
Yes. No, 'cause then you won't
be able to see my face.

00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:33,872
Face down or in the pile of
bodies over there. You pick it.

- Face down. - That's what I thought.
All right. Energy. Energy.

But you're dead. Dead energy.

he's at the happiest point of his life.

scientist's lowest point in the movie.

323
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,724
Okay. Here. He throws his nose
of the cliff into the ocean...

324
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,020
because he's- he's rejecting his
life as a savior of all of mankind.

Uh, what pitch is that, man?

- Oh, yeah. That thing. Yeah.

- We realized that none of us are writers,

00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,373
All right!
I feel like that's...

435
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm a natural born producer.
I love showbiz, dude. I love showbiz.

436
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,836
Uh, can I be in it?
Uh, you know, normally, Dee,

437
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,504
I would take this
opportunity to insult you,

438
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,006
but I'm gonna throw
an insane twist your way.

439
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,968
You're gonna be the lead of the film.
I am? Really?

440
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,136
No, you're not. Twisted again!
Boom! Try and keep up.

441
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,139
Lot of twists. Lot of twists in
this thing, so try and keep up.

442
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,517
There's so many twists,
I can't even follow it.

443
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,561
It's tough to follow.
I'm gonna pull up the first scene...

444
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,397
so you guys can get a taste of what
else is going on in this film.

445
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,857
Yeah. Lay us on it.
It's really good.

446
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,109
Uh- For some reason the phone
is frozen- Lay it on us.

447
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,194
And I'm having a little trouble
pulling up the scene...

448
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,030
And why is there grease
all over...

449
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,033
Is this Frank's g-
goddamn sausage grease?

450
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,870
Frank, you froze my phone
with your sausage greasy fingers!

451
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,747
Frank, you son of a bitch!

452
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,042
