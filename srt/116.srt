1
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:05,681
<i>Holy shit! Holy
shit, that is steep.</i>

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,635
Trust me, this is
the best way to learn.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,019
See, this is why I don't like

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,054
leaving Philly, man.
This is nuts.

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,355
You're gonna be fine, man.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,107
The mountain is a
majestical place

7
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:15,109
where you push your limits and
you maximize your potential.

8
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:17,811
No, the mountain is a place
where you party, man,

9
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:20,781
have fun. That's what it's all about.
Yeah, like those '80s movies.

10
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:23,117
Yeah, but we're not in a movie. I mean, we're
gonna get hurt. We're not gonna get hurt.

11
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:25,592
For some reason, the rules are
just different on the mountain.

12
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,706
The rules for what? Everything, dude.
You've seen those '80s movies.

13
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,708
What do I do with my hands? How do I ski?
Well, you're supposed

14
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:33,877
to have poles. Uh... You know what,
hold on to these guys for balance.

15
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:35,329
These are glass. Yeah.

16
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,982
And don't break 'em, bitch.
What is this,

17
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,667
a double black diamond?
I wish it was a triple black.

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,052
Dudes, let's shred.

00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,695

Still got it, baby!

30
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:32,345
Rip city!

31
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,847
Wonder how Charlie's doing.

32
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:35,482
Oh, here he comes.

33
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,522
Whoa! Whoa!

34
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,025
Uh...

35
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:47,744
Yeah...!

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:12,163

37
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:16,799
Another
beautiful day at Alpine Ridge.

38
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:19,249
End of the season
is right around the corner,

39
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:21,252
so get those turns in
while you can,

40
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,172
and don't forget to sign up
for the big race this Sunday,

41
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:26,758
which will determine
the best skier on the mountain.

42
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,710
<i>That was totally insane.
I mean, I can't believe</i>

43
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,295
you guys can ski like that.
Hmm?

44
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,130
It's just nuts.
I'm not doing it again, man.

45
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:33,765
What are you talking about?
It's so dangerous.

46
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,051
No. You did a great job, man.
Hey, look, is your body hurt?

47
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:37,769
No.
You okay?

48
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:39,614
Yeah. That's 'cause it's
mountain rules, man.

49
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,439
I don't get that, though.
I just feel like I got lucky.

50
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,692
Nah. You just need to learn to use
your edges a little bit more.

51
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,610
Learn to turn...
Right down the mountain!

52
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:47,862
Après-ski!
Let's get our drink on!

53
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:49,564
No, I don't think I'm
gonna be doing that.

54
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,566
I'm gonna get a sensible meal,
head back to my room,

55
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:53,201
log in my times,

56
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:55,236
chart my progress,
'cause I'm gonna win.

57
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,871
Win what?

58
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:57,956
- At skiing.
- Oh, hey.

59
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,541
What's shakin', brother?

60
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,292
Oh, what's shakin'?
Well, I'll tell you

61
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:03,745
what's shakin'--
these skis, quite literally.

62
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:06,381
Now, I need these things waxed
and sharpened by 8:00 a.m.

63
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,999
I want to make first tracks.

64
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,467
No problemo.
Anything else?

65
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:11,219
You guys need helmets?

66
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,971
Uh, I'll take a helmet.
While you're back there,

67
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,840
could you slap a sticker on the
side of mine that says "pussy"?

68
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:18,977
Yeah, I feel you, babe,
but those are the rules.

69
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,729
Whatever, dude. Probably
what makes skiing so fun

70
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:23,231
is that your brains could
get bashed in, in any moment.

71
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,432
Mm-hmm.
Yeah,

72
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:25,984
it didn't used
to always be this way.

73
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,236
This used to be Party Mountain.

74
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,238
Hot babes, cold brews.
And now I hear some

75
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:32,907
corporate stooge wants to turn
this place into a private resort

76
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:36,244
for rich CEOs. They can't
do that to Party Mountain.

77
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,279
It's not called Party Mountain.
It's called Alpine Ridge.

78
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,448
There's one of those
yuppie vultures now.

79
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,501
Don't worry.

80
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:44,953
We got this covered.

81
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:50,208
Show this fat-cat asshole
what's what!

82
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:51,342
Eat this, bitch!

83
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:52,927
Oh, shit.

84
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,629
- What'd you do that for?
- Oh, sorry, Frank.

85
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,961
We thought you were
some jerk-off

86
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,599
who bought the mountain.

87
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,384
I am the jerk-off
who bought the mountain.

88
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:00,435
What?!
I'm turning it

89
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,637
into a members-only resort

90
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,641
for millionaires to plow
their trophy whores in private.

91
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,810
Whoa! That sounds
amazing, Frank.

92
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,895
I'm in. I'm in.
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,363
And ruin Party Mountain?

94
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,782
You know, who cares
about your stupid plans?

95
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:16,151
Let's go rage, Dee.
Hang on a second.

96
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,619
I-I'm, like, so lost.

97
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,155
So, uh, who do I go with
in this situation?

98
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,290
Well, that depends, Charlie.
You could go drink cheap beer

99
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,826
amongst swine and savages,
like you would on any other day,

100
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,295
or... you could get the most
out of this mountain.

101
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,297
And you could get
the most out of yourself

102
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:31,749
by joining an elite class
of athletes and gentlemen alike.

103
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:33,168
Right, Frank?
Yes.

104
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,053
Huh. That sounds kind of cool.

105
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,839
Yeah. All right, you guys go--
why should I go with you?

106
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,340
Go with them.
Who cares?

107
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,925
We're here for two days.

108
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,180
You guys it is!
All right.

109
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,185
Hey-yo!

110
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:52,604
Hey, man.
Remember us from the ski shop?

111
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,155
Ah, the party guys!

112
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:54,906
Hey!
Yeah!

113
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:55,824
Come on in.

114
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:56,941
Yeah!
Yeah!

115
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:59,194
Awesome. Awesome.

116
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,196
Well...
looks like you guys had

117
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,031
a real shit-kicker
last night, huh?

118
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,249
Rager!

119
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,417
Oh, oh, the cans.

120
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:10,538
No, no, we're just recycling
to help pay the rent.

121
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:11,840
Oh.
Mm.

122
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,842
That's my roommate, Turkey.

123
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,344
We call him Turkey, 'cause his
favorite drink is Wild Turkey.

124
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,462
Awesome! Yes!
Oh, badass!

125
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:18,847
Like your suit, too.

126
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,548
What are you, coming
from a Gatsby party?

127
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,183
No, I was in court all day.

128
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:24,302
I was trying to win back
custody of my daughter.

129
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:26,104
Oh.
Mm.

130
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:27,438
That's a bit of a downer.
Yeah.

131
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,524
Yeah, pretty much.

132
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,026
Hey. Hey, Roach. Roach,
come meet some people.

133
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,195
Who stole my goddamn burrito?

134
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:36,481
No, it's there, Roach.
I just moved it to make room

135
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,316
for my coleslaw. Look.

136
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,201
Did you mess with it?

137
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:42,570
Did you come in it?

138
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,875
Did you come in my burrito?!

139
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,543
I didn't come in your burrito!

140
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,078
I wouldn't do that to you!

141
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,883
He's a little squirrelly

142
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,417
from the concussions.

143
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,503
Like I said,
no helmets back in the day.

144
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,224
Guys, I got to admit,
this is, uh...

145
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,427
it's not as much of a party vibe
as it is a, uh...

146
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,096
A pathetic vibe.
Yeah.

147
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,430
Yeah, I mean,

148
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,683
come on, this used to be
Party Mountain,

149
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:13,484
you know, and...
and Babe Manor,

150
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,520
that's the capital
of Party Mountain.

151
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,072
Yeah. When was the last time
you even had a babe in here?

152
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:21,526
Oh, uh... my daughter stopped by
about six weeks ago.

153
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,195
Served me a court summons.
I say count it.

154
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,921
No, don't. Don't count it.
Oh, guys, guys,

155
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,615
guys, guys, don't you
miss the old days,

156
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,367
when you were
the kings of this mountain?

157
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:32,587
You used to rip sweet powder,
then come home and crush brews.

158
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:33,955
I do.

159
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,340
Let's take back this mountain!

160
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:36,624
Why don't you guys dig deep

161
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,959
and show me those
inner party animals.

162
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,294
Let's crush some brews!

163
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:41,095
Let's empty some cans!

164
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:42,764
Yeah! Whoo!
Yeah!

165
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,965
Hey, hey, hey!

166
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,134
Rent money!
No, no.

167
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,518
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, no, no.

168
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:48,770
Drink 'em.
Drink 'em.

169
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:50,688
Oh, yeah,
it's been so long, I forgot.

170
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,140
Let's drink 'em,

171
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,975
Whoo!
then recycle!

172
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,143
Yeah!

173
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:56,144
Sure. Yeah.
Okay.

174
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,620
2,000 acres of private powder,

175
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:08,790
high-speed lifts,
five-star lodging,

176
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,292
and a state-of-the-art spa.

177
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:15,964
Snow Palace.

178
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,999
Well, Frank,
it's... marvelous.

179
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,084
Thank you. There's only
one thing missing.

180
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,053
What's that?

181
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:24,505
- The Dennis Reynolds Ski Academy.
- Could be a...

182
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:27,008
a good idea
to get a model of that.

183
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,593
What are you doing?
Hmm?

184
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:30,011
What are you doing,
eating a tree?

185
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,679
Yeah, I thought
this was made out of candy.

186
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,014
It's a plastic tree, Charlie.

187
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,399
It's not made out of candy.

188
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,267
You said
that this was a candy model.

189
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,653
I never said it was a candy model.
I believe I heard

190
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:40,738
you mention it was a
model made out of candy.

191
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,023
Well, let's just
focus on the banquet

192
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,025
that I'm having tomorrow night

193
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:47,111
to entice local investors.

194
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,579
It'd be a good idea
to get a model of the banquet.

195
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:50,198
We could make that candy.

196
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,033
I'd like to get a
visual on that banquet.

197
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:54,502
And we may as well make it candy.
It should be candy.

198
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:57,171
All right, look, forget about the model,
all right? Let's not talk about the model.

199
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:00,208
The only model
that you should know is Tatiana.

200
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,689
Tatiana, come in here.

201
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,713
Meet Tatiana.

202
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,299
She came all the way
from Bulgaria

203
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,935
to hand-deliver her finest

204
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,720
caviar.

205
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,472
Nicely done, Frank.

206
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,308
She'll be a fitting reward
for me after I win the big race.

207
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,027
Until then,

208
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:21,446
Tatiana,
I want you to clean yourself,

209
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,365
for I will enter you hard
and deep,

210
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:28,286
and it will last for as long
or as short as I please.

211
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:30,905
But you will be clean.

212
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:34,742
Only when you are clean
will you know my power.

213
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,913
What the hell is that?

214
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,716
It sounds like a party.

215
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:50,308
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

216
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:52,260
Yeah! Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

217
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:55,680
This is so great. I can't thank
you enough. I feel alive again.

218
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:58,433
And look at all the cans. We're
gonna be rich! You got to drop it

219
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,401
with the cans, all right? Nobody
cares about the cans. Really. Yep.

220
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,437
Oh, okay, well, what about...

221
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,105
these cans?
Oh! Oh, my God!

222
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,491
You can't do that!
You can't do that.

223
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,327
Though they don't seem to mind. They
look like they're really enjoying it.

224
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:10,578
Yeah, mountain rules, baby!

225
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:13,281
Everybody get your tits out!

226
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,416
Hell yes!

227
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,452
He just said, "Take
your tits out," Yeah.

228
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:20,288
and they all just took their tits out.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep mine in,

229
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,123
just for now.

230
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,628
Party's over, burnout.
Whoops.

231
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,430
Frank Reynolds.

232
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:30,798
Wow.

233
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:32,383
It's been...

234
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,469
30 years to the day.

235
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,270
How they hanging, Drisko?

236
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,474
Uh, I lost one of 'em.
Prostate thing. You know.

237
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:42,310
Yeah, yeah, me, too. It's
still bouncing around in there,

238
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,779
but it don't do nothing.
I'm gonna stop this.

239
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,031
You guys know each other?
We skied together.

240
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:49,951
This mountain wasn't big enough
for both of us.

241
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,820
Loser of the big race
was banned for 30 years.

242
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,289
Looks like old Frank here
let his mouth write a check

243
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,409
his ass couldn't cash.

244
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,495
Huh.

245
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,498
Well, I just wrote
another check.

246
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,384
To buy the mountain.

247
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:09,137
How 'bout we race
for the mountain?

248
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,673
Or are you scared you'll lose?

249
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,093
I don't race no more.

250
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,063
I let my son race for me.

251
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,731
Oh...!

252
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,517
Really?

253
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,185
Your son, huh?

254
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:25,603
Don't think you can beat me?

255
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:27,905
Oh, I'll beat you.

256
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,525
You better go enjoy your party
while it lasts.

257
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,411
It's gonna be your last one.

258
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:35,696
Burnout.

259
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:45,839
Last day
to squeeze in some turns

260
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,508
before tomorrow's big race.
On a side note,

261
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,480
it's good to see Frank Reynolds
back on the hill.

262
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,032
We'll see if he can patch things
up with old rival, Dave Drisko.

263
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,668
But I wouldn't count on it.

264
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,531
Yo, hey, Dennis, did you just hear that?
What?

265
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,917
The-the P.A. announcement.
What-what was that?

266
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,252
Well, there's a lot of people
on this mountain, Charlie.

267
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:04,254
Everybody's gotta stay informed.
Yeah, but that guy was, like, saying

268
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,872
a bunch of, like, really
personal information about us.

269
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,375
Like, how does he know that?
Right. That's how it works.

270
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,377
Why's he talking about us? There's,
like, hundreds of people out here.

271
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,262
Well, we're the most important
thing that's happening right now.

272
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,214
What? Look, I-I think
I got something

273
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:17,634
that's gonna clear this all up
for you. Meet my race team.

274
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,221
Where'd these guys come from?

275
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:23,023
Switzerland?

276
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,392
Yeah, but they came here and
they're racing with us?

277
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,227
I don't... I-I don't
understand that at all.

278
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,062
Well, I needed somebody
to be behind me.

279
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:30,731
I mean, this guy's my...
kind of my captain,

280
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,566
and these guys are my goons,
you know? If I need 'em

281
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:34,201
to do something for me,
back me up, you know,

282
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,902
if I'm getting into some...
And... they just

283
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:37,237
showed up and they're
racing with you?

284
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,072
Yeah.

285
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:40,907
All right. No
more questions.

286
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,660
- Okay, good. All right. Uh, yeah, I-I...
- Okay.

287
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,579
All right, now, listen up, guys.

288
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,214
Tomorrow's the big race.

289
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,884
And anything less than first
place will not be tolerated.

290
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,803
In fact, it'll be punished.

291
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,973
But, remember,
I want you to have fun.

292
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:59,226
But not if it means you're not
gonna get first place.

293
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,228
'Cause
I'll-I'll punish you.

294
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,398
All right, now go limber up, and
I'll-I'll meet you at the chair.

295
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,767
Let's go, guys.
March, march, march.

296
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:09,903
Wow. Uh,
I got to hand it to you,

297
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,072
looks like you got
a pretty good team.

298
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,658
I think so, too. Yeah, yeah. Uh,
look, I don't... I don't get

299
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:17,361
anything that's happening.
So, uh, I'm out,

300
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,112
you know what I mean? And maybe
we should drink some beer,

301
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,614
eat some snow, and just...

302
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,000
What the hell, man?

303
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,701
I'm disappointed in you.

304
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,787
I thought you were a champion.

305
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,623
Why? You showed me some
real stuff out there, guy.

306
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,508
I was falling. You were
falling, but you were fast.

307
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:33,593
But I crashed into some tables.

308
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,629
Crashing and exploding is all
part of the learning curve.

309
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:37,097
I could turn you
into a champion,

310
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,965
but that's clearly
not what you want.

311
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,768
You want to just be a burnout and
a loser like those other guys.

312
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,020
Dude, I don't even
understand you, man.

313
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,104
Just, like, take it easy...

314
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,260
Where are those coming from?

315
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:46,973
I'm out, dude.

316
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,476
Like, it's crazy to me.

317
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:50,977
I'm gonna hang out
with Mac and Dee

318
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,813
and see if I can
figure them out, man...

319
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,315
Oh, yeah, yeah. Go hang with
those other two burnout losers.

320
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,067
Yeah, go ahead. You know
what your problem is, buddy?

321
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,453
You got no allegiance.
We're here for two days!

322
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,872
Look like Charlie
Kelly's walking off the mountain

323
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:03,874
and out of the big race,
ladies and gentlemen.

324
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,876
He knows my name!

325
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,961
He knows my name!

326
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,964
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

327
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,217
Take a look.

328
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,636
Oh, wow!

329
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,422
Can you see through the wall? Yeah.
Yeah, you can see right through.

330
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,924
Okay, I think I'm getting it.
Yeah. Yeah? Okay.

331
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,895
- Hey! I heard your guys' voices. What are
you guys doing in here? - Hey!

332
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,500
We are in the middle of a prank
war with Frank and Dennis. Yeah.

333
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,232
All right, nice. What's
the prank? What's the prank?

334
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,600
We're drilling a hole
in the women's shower

335
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,853
so we can look at 'em naked.
Yeah.

336
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,356
Why? What-what does that
have to do with Frank and Dennis?

337
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,275
I don't know. I don't know.
Well, nothing, really.

338
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,827
It's just a warm-up prank to
get the juices flowing. Yeah!

339
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,746
Warm-up. We're warming up.

340
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,698
I don't want to be a bummer,
but I kind of

341
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,367
don't get how spying
on naked, unaware women

342
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,619
- is a prank at all.
- Me, either.

343
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,538
Me, either. Me, either.
Well, the real prank

344
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,590
Mm-hmm. is when I jam
my dick through that hole

345
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,375
and yell, "Special
delivery!"

346
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,761
- Oh, dude, I don't think so.
- Oh, no.

347
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,013
You can't do that, man. You'd get in a
lot of trouble for something like that.

348
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,598
That's, like... Yeah.
Maybe we can just

349
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,767
do something that doesn't
involve naked women.

350
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:06,436
Just... You know, 'cause
that's not fun for me.

351
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,054
How 'bout if I show you my dick?

352
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,139
Why would I want that?

353
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,974
Oh, okay, okay, it's a prank

354
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,560
if you don't want to see it
but he shows you anyway.

355
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,313
This guy gets it. It's gonna be hilarious.
I think I get it.

356
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,982
I'm gonna get myself hard,
and I will show you what I mean.

357
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,617
Hold on a sec. Oh. Oh.

358
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,658
Oh, you bastard! You know what,
if you guys are already hard,

359
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,711
just go ahead of me and
I'll-I'll just circle back.

360
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,247

Oh, my God. Uh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to spy.

373
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,000
I was just walking by;
I'm not a Peeping Tom.

374
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:11,785
Oh, Charlie, I do not mind.

375
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,920
We are on the mountain.

376
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,922
Yeah.
What does that mean?

377
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,457
Everyone keeps saying,
"We're on the mountain,"

378
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,426
but I-I don't get it,
you know what I mean?

379
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,961
Look, where I come
from, you know,

380
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:22,796
jamming your dick through
a hole in the wall,

381
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,130
that-that's assault,
that's a felony,

382
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,099
and, uh, it's just plain wrong.

383
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,133
Something bothering you,
Charlie?

384
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,019
You do not like my breasts?

385
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:32,105
Uh, no, no, your breasts...
your breasts are great.

386
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,975
Do you want to jump in with me
in the hot tub now?

387
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,979
Yeah. You know,
um... Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,981
I'm gonna stop complaining
about the mountain.

389
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna let
the mountain work for me.

390
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:44,401
Now we're talking.

391
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,152

Welcome to the annual big race.

401
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,060
Who will take home
the top prize?

402
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,229
Local free spirit Dave Drisko...

403
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,366
...or fierce new competitor
Dennis Reynolds?

404
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,453
The stakes are high
because the loser today

405
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,655
is walking off the mountain
for 30 years.

406
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,658
Do you realize how important
this race is, Dennis?

407
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:44,827
Well, yeah, 'cause he just said
how important it is.

408
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,495
I hope you got your bags packed.

409
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,997
I'm gonna get rid of you

410
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,632
once and for all,
Frank Reynolds.

411
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,333
I'm gonna save Party Mountain

412
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,803
and bring back the
glorious good old days.

413
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:54,754
Freeze! Police!

414
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,842
David Drisko,
you're under arrest.

415
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,477
Oh, shit!

416
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,179
They framed Drisko
so he couldn't do

417
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,680
the big race!
Oh, come on!

418
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,515
This man has committed
a litany of sexual assaults.

419
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,517
His semen was recovered
from crime scenes

420
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,352
all over the mountain.

421
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,821
Let's go, pal.

422
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,355
Lose the hat.

423
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,028
This guy might not be as
cool as we thought he was.

424
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,613
Even his awesome hair
is bullshit.

425
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,281
You forgot one charge.
What's that?

426
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,033
Assaulting an officer!

427
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:26,452
Never stop partying!

428
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:27,369
Oh!

429
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,042
That'll do. You know? Let
them keep thumping ass.

430
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,254
He probably deserves it.
Yeah.

431
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:36,712
Never stop partying.

432
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:38,681
Never stop partying!

433
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:40,382
So...

434
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:43,352
which one of you losers wants
to win a silver medal?

435
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,354
Ugh. Not me--
I got blasted last night.

436
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:47,223
I'm so sick. I don't
feel good, either.

437
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:48,557
I'd also like to remove myself

438
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:50,443
from the sexual predator team.

439
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,977
Well, I guess that does it.

440
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:54,563
The winner by default
of the annual big race is...

441
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,232
Not so fast!

442
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,120
This is good.

443
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,456
So you gonna race for them?

444
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,374
No, Dennis, I'm gonna
race for everyone.

445
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,576
I want to race for the people.

446
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,628
You see,
last night Tatiana taught me

447
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,247
all about Communism.

448
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,582
Cold, hard winters, gross soups.

449
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:16,168
She also taught me
a lot about sex.

450
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,887
Sweet sex, amazing sex,

451
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,922
a lot of sex,
Jacuzzi sex, Dennis!

452

Charlie can still win!

469
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,179
Go, Charlie!

470
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,598
Come on, Charlie!

471
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,984
Little faster! Come on!
A little faster, bud.

472
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,936
Straighten out!

473
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,189
No! No!
No! No!

474
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,776
Yeah!
Ah, shit!

475
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:05,244
Okay.

476
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,529
- I won!
- All right.

477
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,497
The mountain is ours, Frank!

478
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,418
Uh... not exactly.

479
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,786
Uh...

480
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:15,871
actually, uh...
the whole Snow Palace thing

481
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,873
was, uh, all for show.

482
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,925
Huh?

483
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,595
I needed to distract the local
environmentalist groups

484
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,381
while I fracked the mountain.

485
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,183
Wh-Wh... What?!
You fracked the mountain?

486
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:30,019
Yeah. Yeah,
the banquet, the race--

487
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,687
it was all set up.

488
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,606
It was just a diversion,
it was...

489
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,892
a distraction, because
I wanted to get into this hill

490
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:39,645
and suck out
its natural resources.

491
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,281
So all this here was
just one big setup?

492
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,700
Yeah.
I hired the hookers,

493
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:47,286
so you could rip their tops off.
That makes sense.

494
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,738
Oh... That makes a lot of sense.

495
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:52,291
So what do we do now?
I'm good. You want to...

496
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,896
you want to stick
around, it's okay. No.

497
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:55,494
It'd be good to go back to
Philly, right? I mean...

498
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,046
I'm pretty tired.
It was quite a weekend.

499
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,464
Honestly, I don't even
like skiing that much.

500
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,166
I-I need to go see a doctor.

501
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:03,052
Yeah, I should probably see a
doctor, too, actually, I guess,

502
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,553
if Tatiana was a hooker.
Oh, yeah.

503
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,888
Oh, God, gross. Yeah.
That's not good.

504
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,925
Well, folks, you heard it.

505
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:12,261
Frank fracked the mountain,
and it looks like

506
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,647
- we'll all be out of jobs.
- Oh... God!

507
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,482
So, did you even hire<i> that</i> guy?

508
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,435
You know, Charlie, I have
no idea who that guy is.

509
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,021
Huh. I guess some things really
are different on the mountain.

510
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,989
Yeah.

511
