1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:03,567
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,137
It's been one week since
my last confession.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,938
Okay, my son.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,711
In the name of the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, what is your confession?

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,547
I'm fat.

6

7
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:45,573
Oh, great and angry God, I
command thee to smite my friends!

8
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:46,775
Now, calm down, son.

9
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:47,542
Calm down.

10
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,645
Let's try and remain composed.

11
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,479
Okay, Father.

12
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:53,049
I'll try, but I can't promise
anything 'cause I'm pretty excitable.

13
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,251
Also, I'm super pissed because
my friends made me fat.

14
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,253
How did your friends make you fat?

15
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:59,789
Were they force-feeding you?

16
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,458
Well, no, not exactly.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,661
This whole thing started because
we became incredibly successful,

18
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:09,831
and then they became monsters, which
in turn made them make me fat.

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,167
So, really, I'd like to confess on them,
because they're sinners and pricks.

20
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:18,838
Son, I don't think you understand
the purpose of confession.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,539
Right.

22
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,206
All right.

23
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:20,874
Sorry, Father.

24
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:21,675
You need the context.

25
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,243
Let me start at the beginning.

26
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,913
Now, my friends and I own and
operate a bar in South Philly.

27
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:30,350
And a few weeks ago, we became more
successful than we ever have before.

28
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,252
It was insane.

29
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:34,254
Oh, oh, oh!

30
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:35,856
Look who's back!

31
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:39,526
I scored a shitload of fireworks.

32
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:41,027
Out of my way, Frank.

33
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:41,995
Oh.

34
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,229
Hey.

35
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,130
Whoa.

36
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:46,966
North Carolina-- what
a hell of a state.

37
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:47,767
Not now, Frank.

38
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,869
We're packed.

39
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,272
What the shit is
going on around here?

40
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,810
I really don't get it.

41
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:59,378
I don't see how we're so popular now.

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,912
I just can't
wrap my head around this.

43
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,181
Were we doing anything different?

44
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,850
Guys, we may have tipped.

45
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:05,584
Uh-oh.

46
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:06,953
No, this is a good thing.

47
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:09,356
This is what happens with
success in business.

48
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,023
Hmm?

49
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,193
Okay, if you keep making the
right decisions over time,

50
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:17,265
eventually you will get to a point where
you tip, and you become successful.

51
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,067
It's like that book <i>The Tipping</i> <i>Point.</i>

52
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,235
<i>I totally buy that.</i>

53
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,237
<i>I totally-- like, check
out this decision.</i>

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,506
<i>I keep a very clean bar
every day, very tidy.</i>

55
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:25,507
<i>I think people respond to that.</i>

56
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,575
<i>They say, "What was that clean
bar I was at the other week?"</i>

57
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,476
<i>And then they show up again.</i>

58
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,645
<i>And then someone says, "Hey,
did you see that clean bar?</i>

59
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:31,679
<i>Let's go there."</i>

60
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,680
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

61
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,415
<i>And my comedy, you know.</i>

62
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,951
<i>Like, all my, all my funny jokes
and stuff that I throw out.</i>

63
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:40,621
<i>You know, I'm like the cute, funny
waitress who has all these</i>

64
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:44,759
<i>one-liners and hilarious jabs I
throw at the customers, and I</i>

65
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,228
<i>add all that charm to the place.</i>

66
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,063
<i>That's-That's probably doing it.</i>

67
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,866
<i>Yeah, good-looking guy like
myself, takes pride in his</i>

68
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,469
<i>personal appearance, takes pride
in his personal hygiene, has</i>

69
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,304
<i>great hair.</i>

70
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,506
<i>You know, you put a guy like that
behind the bar, and people</i>

71
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:58,174
<i>will eventually flock to this man.</i>

72
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,709
<i>That-That's what you're saying, yeah.</i>

73
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,311
<i>That's what you're saying.</i>

74
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:02,546
<i>Sort of.</i>

75
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:05,047
<i>I didn't think it was...
No, the point is that we got</i>

76
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,782
<i>to keep doing what it is that we do.</i>

77
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:07,450
<i>Yes.</i>

78
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:09,885
<i>No matter how psychotically vain...
Right.</i>

79
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:13,422
<i>...or needy and pathetic
or, I mean, just plain sad.</i>

80
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,890
<i>Well, let's not put labels on
it, 'cause we don't know which</i>

81
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,559
<i>one is the one that is the most...</i>

82
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,194
<i>If we keep doing all of it...
Mm-hmm.</i>

83
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:20,728
<i>...then we'll keep tipping up.</i>

84
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,395
<i>Yes.</i>

85
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:22,063
<i>Nice.</i>

86
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,166
<i>In order to maintain this
success, I do think though we</i>

87
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,334
<i>need to get some rest.</i>

88
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,636
<i>Let's do the right thing here for
once in our lives, and let's</i>

89
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:30,139
<i>go home and get a good night's sleep.</i>

90
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,576
<i>But that sleep would never
come, Father, because success</i>

91
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:36,846
<i>was about to change everything.</i>

92
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,049
<i>Hey, Charlie, you asleep?</i>

93
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,017
<i>Charlie, are you asleep?</i>

94
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:40,684
<i>No. No.</i>

95
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:41,885
<i>I had a great idea.</i>

96
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:42,853
<i>I don't want to hear it.</i>

97
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,121
<i>Frank, I'm a successful man now, okay?</i>

98
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:47,390
<i>I need to maintain a certain level
of excellence, so I can't</i>

99
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:49,425
<i>have you, like, telling me
terrible ideas all night, 'cause</i>

100
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,860
<i>that brings me off my excellence, okay?</i>

101
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,562
<i>Okay, but this is a great idea.</i>

102
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,630
<i>I don't want to...
We take, we take the M-80s</i>

103
00:03:54,632 --> 00:04:01,036
<i>that I have, and we stic'em in
some lamb and pa-cha, we blow it up!</i>

104
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,104
<i>What are you looking to do?</i>

105
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:06,042
<i>Like, flash-cook a-a gyro sandwich?</i>

106
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,243
<i>Yeah.</i>

107
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:08,845
<i>That's a good idea.</i>

108
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:09,980
<i>Flash-cook a sandwich.</i>

109
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,049
<i>Oh, my God...
Cook the meat immediately.</i>

110
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,418
<i>I mean, what you're talking
about is just a meat bomb, and</i>

111
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,553
<i>that's a waste of a good lamb.</i>

112
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,256
<i>So if you're done with coming up
with terrible ideas, um, I'm</i>

113
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,224
<i>going to go back to bed.</i>

114
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,659
<i>A meat bomb!</i>

115
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,027
<i>You-You blow it up.</i>

116
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,730
<i>I mean, like, just take the
thing and stick it...</i>

117
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,367
<i>I'm going to the crevice!</i>

118
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,368
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

119
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,869
<i>Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
don't go in the crevice.</i>

120
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,237
<i>Charlie, don't go in the crevice.</i>

121
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,004
<i>I'm going in the crevice.</i>

122
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,406
<i>Come on, don't go in the crevice.</i>

123
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,642
<i>Oh, come on, man.</i>

124
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,679
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

125
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:43,480
<i>Yello.</i>

126
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,147
<i>Hey-o.</i>

127
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:44,814
<i>It's Mac.</i>

128
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:45,582
<i>What's up?</i>

129
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,449
<i>Hey-o!</i>

130
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,316
<i>'Sup?!</i>

131
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,918
<i>Yeah, I'm going to go out and rage.</i>

132
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,585
<i>Is Charlie there?</i>

133
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:50,386
<i>Hey, it's Mac.</i>

134
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:51,454
<i>He wants to go rage.</i>

135
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,221
<i>I don't care.</i>

136
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:53,656
<i>I'm in the crevice.</i>

137
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,091
<i>He's in the crevice.</i>

138
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:56,259
<i>Shit, he's in the crevice?</i>

139
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,127
<i>I'll come out with you.</i>

140
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:57,794
<i>We'll go out.</i>

141
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:58,728
<i>You and me, we'll go together.</i>

142
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,396
<i>We'll have a ball.</i>

143
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,665
<i>Hello?</i>

144
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,602
<i>I-I'm not seeing how this
relates to your weight gain.</i>

145
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,704
<i>Uh, I'm telling a story, Father.</i>

146
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,606
<i>Frank's not a guy that usually
comes up with plans.</i>

147
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,742
<i>I mean, you want to know all the
key players and how success</i>

148
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,476
<i>affected them, right?</i>

149
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,913
<i>Well, I think your time could
be better spent if you focus</i>

150
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,614
<i>more on yourself.</i>

151
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,818
<i>But I haven't done very much wrong.</i>

152
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,919
<i>Okay, you know what, Father?</i>

153
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,820
<i>I'm just going to plow ahead,
because I'm sensing some</i>

154
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,554
<i>resistance.</i>

155
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,424
<i>And Dennis always tells me, never
let someone's resistance</i>

156
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,526
<i>stop you from getting what you want.</i>

157
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,028
<i>So, the bar's success continued.</i>

158
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,530
<i>But Dee's inflated ego about her
comedy was keeping her from</i>

159
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,364
<i>doing her job.</i>

160
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,667
<i>Kids these days, they have so
many more choices than we had</i>

161
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,268
<i>when we were little.</i>

162
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,935
<i>Am I right?</i>

163
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:38,802
<i>Excuse me? Excuse me?</i>

164
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,837
<i>I mean, it's like, do you</i>

165
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,939
<i>want to watch</i> <i>Kung Fu
Panda</i> on Blu-ray... Excuse me?

166
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:42,640
Oh, my God. Yeah?

167
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,142
We are still waiting on those beers.

168
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,610
Yeah, I know.

169
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,813
Right in the middle of the joke.

170
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,048
And now where was I with it?

171
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,818
Can, um, we get those margaritas
that we ordered a while ago, as well?

172
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,485
That'd be great.

173
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,153
Yeah.

174
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,088
Can I finish the joke?

175
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,290
'Cause the funny part comes at the
end, so you're going to miss

176
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:59,393
it if you don't... Right.
No, you-you keep trying to tell jokes and...

177
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,995
Well, you keep interrupting
me, and that's why I'm not...

178
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,630
Well, they're not really
landing is what I'm trying to...

179
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,231
Oh, they're not landing
because I'm not getting to the

180
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,500
punch line, so if you could just
be patient and let me get it out.

181
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:08,702
Kids these days have so many more choices...
No, don't, don't try to

182
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:09,303
finish the joke.

183
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:10,204
Don't try to finish the joke.

184
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,105
I'm not even going to listen.

185
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,873
Oh, I just want my margarita, I
just want my margarita, I just

186
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,474
want my margarita.

187
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,941
You know what, you're not
getting your margarita.

188
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,009
Thanks.

189
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,243
Why do we have this?

190
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,645
What is this?

191
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,647
Dude, where the hell have you been?

192
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,115
Uh, slept in.

193
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:23,049
You slept in?

194
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:24,584
It's, like, almost the
middle of the night, man.

195
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:25,685
Why were you sleeping in?

196
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:26,586
Oh, God.

197
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:29,054
Well, because I drank three
bottles of champagne and hung

198
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,189
out with a stray dog all
night under a bridge, okay?

199
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,324
It was sweet.

200
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,859
Can I please get, like, 20
margaritas so this bitch will

201
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,660
listen to my kid joke?

202
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,695
Okay, first of all, your
jokes never land, all right?

203
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,897
So please don't concentrate on
your comedy anymore, 'cause it's

204
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,698
terrible, all right?

205
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,565
I'm sorry, I said it.

206
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,701
Look, can we just do
what we normally do?

207
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,402
I shouldn't even be
bartending, all right?

208
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,738
I'm in over my head, I'm yelling
at customers 'cause I'm getting

209
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,606
a little agitated here.

210
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,040
Can Dennis please come
here and do this?

211
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:50,708
Where is Dennis?

212
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,943
Dennis is in the bathroom, and
he's been there for, like, an hour.

213
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,045
Okay, company meeting in
the bathroom, okay, guys?

214
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:55,712
Company meeting.

215
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,446
Let's go.

216
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,447
Dennis?

217
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,448
Where are you, bud?

218
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,450
Company meeting.

219
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,451
Uh, I'm in here.

220
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,452
All right, good, man.

221
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,453
Hop on out. Company meeting.

222
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,454
I don't want to.

223
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,455
You have to.

224
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,456
It's a company meeting.

225
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,459
You have to... No.

226
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,259
What's going on in there?

227
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,260
I'm bashing it.

228
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,262
Huh?

229
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,263
I'm bashing it.

230
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,097
Oh, no. Don't bash.

231
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,098
Don't bash.

232
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,099
I'll come out. I'll come out.

233
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,201
Oh.

234
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:17,403
Uh, I saw a couple gray
hairs, and I was, like, "I'll

235
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,639
eradicate those," and then...
With black paint?

236
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,341
Well, just-just go
easy on me, all right?

237
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,342
Don't make fun of me or anything.

238
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,343
I feel very sensitive right now.

239
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:25,344
It's hard to maintain all this.

240
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,345
You look like Superman.

241
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:27,346
Oh, cool. Yeah, right on.

242
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,348
Well, he was the
original, right, so...?

243
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,349
The original what?

244
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,051
S-Superhero. He was, like... Ugh.

245
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,053
Is that what you're going for?

246
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,054
No.

247
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,055
Dude, come on.

248
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,723
It would be that obvious,
like, if you didn't know me.

249
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,358
You'd be, like, "Oh, shit.
Maybe that's Superman."

250
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,192
No, you wouldn't.

251
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,860
Everyone knows who Superman is,
and they know it's not you.

252
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,862
Shit. Right.

253
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,696
Guys, come on.

254
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,531
Clearly, success is starting
to get to all of us.

255
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,532
We can't be Superman.

256
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,534
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:49,368
Uh, yeah. No shit.

258
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,037
I'm running around like
an animal out there.

259
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,872
I mean, all I'm doing
is serving drinks.

260
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,641
You're supposed to serve
drinks; You're a waitress.

261
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:57,310
People need their drinks, and we need
a waitress to serve those drinks.

262
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:58,312
Guys, don't change now.

263
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,313
All right?

264
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:00,981
We have a certain chemistry
that got us here to begin with.

265
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:01,982
All right?

266
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:03,817
We don't need to start...
Oh, that's terrible.

267
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,486
Let's just get back out there and
step it up a little bit, please.

268
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,488
Let's just get back to work,
man, and do what we do, okay?

269
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,423
You're not good.

270
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,491
"Back to work.

271
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,492
Back to work, everybody.

272
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,061
I'm Charlie, and I'm in
charge all of a sudden."

273
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,297
Are you eating in there?

274
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,567
Uh, yeah, I got some donuts and
some M&Ms and some, uh, chips.

275
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,569
I could pass them through
if you want some.

276
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,260
You aren't allowed to eat in here.

277
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,539
I'm sorry, Father.

278
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,540
I-I have enough.

279
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,609
If you want a donut, I
could give you one.

280
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,646
You better put that away and
come back when you're finished.

281
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,648
Okay.

282
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,783
I... I'm done... done.

283
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,653
Uh, so Charlie was up all night
working, and Frank was still

284
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,591
coming up with plans,
and they were not good.

285
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,863
Oh, shit.

286
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:51,864
Oh, my God.

287
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,833
It's morning already, huh?

288
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,404
Ow!

289
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,406
Hey, that's good.

290
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,240
You want to do that to people?

291
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:01,241
What is that?

292
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,242
What are you doing?

293
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:03,243
It's a plan.

294
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,077
We'll do it to people.

295
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,079
We'll go around... Look at that.

296
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:06,913
Look at the look on your face.

297
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:07,913
That's so good.

298
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,615
Frank, I don't even think
you know what a plan is, dude.

299
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,285
All right, I got something else
I've been working on all night.

300
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,119
Come on, come with me.

301
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,120
Lock up, let's go, come with me.

302
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,955
Don't hit me with the stick again.
Oh, my God.

303
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:16,956
Okay, Charlie?

304
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,958
All right, look at this now.

305
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,959
I put two extra stop signs.

306
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,959
Yeah.

307
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,261
Now there's four stop signs.

308
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:23,263
All right So no cars can go.

309
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,174
Frank, you've just created
a four-way intersection.

310
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,176
If anything, you've made
this intersection safer.

311
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:37,177
No shit. Oh.

312
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:40,180
Look, dude, I don't have time
for these shenanigans, all right?

313
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,181
I need sleep.

314
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,182
I'm a success now.

315
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:43,183
I'm trying so hard not to tip.

316
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,183
Ow.

317
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,184
You need sleep?

318
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,253
Stop hitting me with the
stick, dude, I swear to God...

319
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,189
This is the plan, this is
the one we should have done.

320
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,191
Don't hit me with that anymore. Oh!

321
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:52,059
That was the one.

322
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,061
You little bitch.

323
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,169
And Charlie was, like, "I'm
gonna jam that stick up your ass."

324
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,838
And then Frank was, like, "Come here,
you little bitch, uh, God damn it."

325
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,674
Don't need to repeat all
of the obscene language.

326
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:04,675
Oh, I'm sorry, Father.

327
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:08,479
I... I got lost in the moment
because I'm a natural storyteller.

328
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,548
Oh... Anyway, I was being super
prudent, and I was mapping out

329
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,550
my successful lifestyle-- you
know, champagne, sailing.

330
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:15,919
I've always wanted to sail.

331
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,521
I was really the only one who
was handling the success with

332
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,256
class, to be honest with you.

333
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:24,493
When Dee interrupted me with some
lazy plan to get out of working.

334
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,795
Lazy's a sin, right?

335
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:26,796
Uh, you mean sloth?

336
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:27,797
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,568
Dee is guilty of sloth,
and she's pro-abortion.

338
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,138
Hey.

339
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,139
Okay, listen to this.

340
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:41,577
One sec.

341
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,081
Just picking out the places I want to
avoid when I sail across the world.

342
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,048
No Africa for you, huh?

343
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,049
No.

344
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:49,318
I don't want to go to any
poor places, you know.

345
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,487
Successful guy like myself,
I'll have a target on my back.

346
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,488
Right.

347
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,993
So, I guess... Okay. Well...
That's, uh... And, uh, too cold.

348
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,228
Yeah.

349
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,229
Ugh. Too violent.

350
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:00,597
Yeah, it's hot down there.

351
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,598
Too angry.

352
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,599
Oh, the whole thing?

353
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,602
You're just going to sail around the
United States is what it looks like.

354
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:10,307
That's all you're... Uh, well, I
probably want to avoid, like, this.

355
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,308
Yeah.

356
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,309
Don't blame you for that.

357
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,311
And I don't know
what happens out here.

358
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:15,312
Okay, I tell you what.

359
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,514
Uh, while you were planning all
of this, I came up with an

360
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:20,083
amazing idea that's going
to save everything for us.

361
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,451
You ready for this?

362
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,154
We get ourselves replacements.

363
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,155
That's not a very good idea.

364
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:26,156
Well, stay with me.

365
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,158
They're not just any replacements.

366
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,227
They'll be the total embodiment
of us in looks and personality

367
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,663
so that we maintain the same group
chemistry and avoid tipping.

368
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:35,666
So they'll be like our avatars?

369
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:36,666
Sure, if that helps you.

370
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:37,667
Let's tell Dennis.

371
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,504
Okay, yeah.

372
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,505
Hey, hey, hey, Dennis, wake up.

373
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,506
I'm not sleeping.

374
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,506
What are you doing?

375
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,143
Why are you hiding under the covers?

376
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:50,047
Mm.

377
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,950
My God.

378
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:53,951
Do I look foolish?

379
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,821
Well, what in God's name
have you done to your face?

380
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:57,822
I got a chemical peel.

381
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,791
You look like a monster, dude.

382
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:03,195
I was just trying to live up to
all of your expectations of me.

383
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,197
What expectations?

384
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,099
Physical perfection.

385
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,100
What?

386
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,603
Clearly, the success of the
bar has proved that I have

387
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,071
achieved physical perfection.

388
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,707
And now there's nowhere else for
me to go but down from here.

389
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,077
So now I'm hanging on by a thread.

390
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,180
Why don't you lay off the
skin treatments for a while?

391
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:22,349
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,619
Oh, you don't think I should
mess with my face anymore?

393
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,855
Well, right now it looks
like you're wearing a mask of

394
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:28,789
yourself over your face.

395
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,791
Mm-hmm.

396
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,793
Not a good one, not
a nice mask of myself?

397
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:32,794
Not a good one.

398
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,796
Do you guys think that a normal
mask of me might look good?

399
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:36,797
Oh, my God.

400
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,799
And if there was,
would you guys wear it?

401
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,800
What is happening?

402
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,829
I'm very confused.

403
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,837
I'm going to be alone.

404
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,310
Okay.

405
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,813
And without Dennis to shit all
over Dee's ideas with me, I was

406
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:57,685
lured into her very lazy,
slothy, sinful avatar plan.

407
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:02,356
Mm, I got to say, I like
what I'm seeing here.

408
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:03,424
Mm-hmm.

409
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:07,362
Yeah, let me, uh... let me just
fill you in on what we're doing here.

410
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,098
See, Mac and I run the hottest
bar in Philadelphia, and we are

411
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,501
looking for a couple of employees
to fill our shoes, literally.

412
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,503
Mm. That said, there's a set
of dumbbells to your feet there.

413
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:18,839
I'd like you to lift those and curl
them, but don't do it in a normal way.

414
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,241
Now, this is for a
bartending job, right?

415
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,242
Yeah.

416
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:23,777
Yeah, this is all part of it.

417
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:24,778
Now, get to work beefcake.

418
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Okay. Guess I can fire
off a couple reverse curls.

419
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:28,781
He said fire off.

420
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:29,782
I like that.

421
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:30,783
Yeah, I heard him.

422
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:31,784
I like that.

423
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:32,785
Look... look at that.

424
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:33,785
Excellent.

425
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:34,786
Oh, man.

426
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:35,788
He executed those perfectly.

427
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,789
Uh.

428
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,791
That was exactly
what I'm talking about.

429
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:39,792
I'd like to fast-track him, Dee.

430
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:40,793
He's perfect.

431
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:41,794
What? For you?

432
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:42,795
Yeah, of course.

433
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:43,796
What do...?

434
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:44,797
He looks nothing like you.

435
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,798
Well, no.

436
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,701
I mean, since we've been working, I've
been neglecting my fitness regimen.

437
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,969
He understands... No, no, no, no.

438
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:54,139
You never, ever once in your
life have looked like that.

439
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:58,143
When I leave the gym, and I
have a full pump... Yeah?

440
00:13:58,145 --> 00:13:59,278
Dee was right though.

441
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,283
For me to use that gorgeous
muscle monster as my avatar, I

442
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,751
had to put on some serious bulk.

443
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,854
So did you go to the gym?

444
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:08,255
The gym?

445
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:10,791
Father, when Peter did the
statue of David, he wasn't just

446
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:11,659
hammering at pebbles.

447
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:15,062
First, he ordered the Jews to bring
him a massive slab of marble.

448
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,063
Okay.

449
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,464
Let's wrap this up.

450
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:18,599
Right.

451
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,601
Okay, so Charlie was
working his ass off.

452
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:23,570
Uh, but the customers were getting
just as frustrated as he was.

453
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,672
Clearly, the pressures of success
were cracking both he and Dennis.

454
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:27,573
Hang on a second.

455
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,273
Hang on a second.

456
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,174
I got this guy.

457
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:30,242
I got my man right here.

458
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,212
You're the one who wanted the, uh, two
Coors Lights and the gin and tonic.

459
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:33,880
Is that right?

460
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:34,580
No.

461
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,315
I've been waiting half an
hour for a Jack and Coke.

462
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,717
You've been waiting half an hour?

463
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,118
You've been waiting half an hour?

464
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,353
Well, with an attitude like that, you
can wait another half an hour, buddy.

465
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:42,788
Hey, this drink tastes like bleach.

466
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,624
Because I'm dipping them in bleach
so that I can clean them faster.

467
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,693
I don't have time to
wash every single glass.

468
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,494
I dip it in bleach, then it's clean!

469
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:50,295
I'm not drinking bleach.

470
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:51,329
Then get out of my bar!

471
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,197
Get out of my bar!

472
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:52,998
I don't want to see you.

473
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,665
Is that your buddy?

474
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,332
You go with him.

475
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,233
No, I don't even know him.

476
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,167
You don't even know him.

477
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,302
Okay, well, become friends,
and you walk home!

478
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,670
Get out!

479
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,606
Unbelievable.

480
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:03,773
What's going on, man?

481
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,942
What's going on, dude, is
that I'm completely overwhelmed.

482
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:07,110
I suck at bartending.

483
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,278
I'm going crazy.

484
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,312
Everyone's yelling at me.

485
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:10,312
They're getting all pissed off.

486
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:11,647
Why is your face shiny?

487
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,583
I had my skin
peeled off wh chemicals.

488
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,250
Yeah?

489
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,718
Want to know why?

490
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,753
Not really.

491
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:19,122
Well, it's just, uh, you
know, I've created a level of

492
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:22,025
success for myself that, uh, I
just don't know if I can live up

493
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:22,826
to it anymore, man.

494
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:26,527
My level of excellence is so high
that I'm feeling the pressures, man.

495
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:28,881
Dude, I'm operating at
such an excellent level.

496
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:29,549
It's insane.

497
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:32,251
You know, I'm running at of ten
of excellence, and I'm used to

498
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,285
being at whatever number.

499
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,921
I-I don't even want to be at a--
like, somewhere lower, but whatever.

500
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,956
The point is that I'm not
going to let the bar down.

501
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,790
You know what I mean?

502
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:42,927
He being on the tipping point is
about working hard and caring

503
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,065
about that work and really
giving it your all.

504
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:46,617
Let's get high in the back office.

505
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,118
Let's get high and
drop all this, right?

506
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,424
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

507
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,460
Deandra, you got to-- all you
have to do is hold the pigeon,

508
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,062
and I stick the M80 under
its wing, I blow it up.

509
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:28,914
No, Frank.

510
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,650
I'm not going to help
you detonate a pigeon.

511
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,818
That would be terrible publicity
for a young comedienne.

512
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,620
Well, you-you don't
have to do anything.

513
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:37,489
I just-- we stick the pigeon
in there, we run, the flock

514
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,023
blows up, we got a lot of tasty meat.

515
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:39,691
Hold on, hold on.

516
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:40,358
Shut up.

517
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,025
We have a pigeon feast.

518
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:41,793
Shut up. What's going on?

519
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:42,460
Where is everyone?

520
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,495
I have all kinds of new
bits and no audience.

521
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:45,662
Oh, shit.

522
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:46,630
Maybe we tipped too soon.

523
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:47,798
No. No.

524
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,633
I was just starting to
get a taste of success.

525
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,067
I need more.

526
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:51,735
What's that?

527
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:52,402
Music.

528
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:53,270
Coming from in the back.

529
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:55,005
Back here?

530
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,076
What?

531
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,078
Hey! What the hell are you
ck bags doing back here?

532
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,647
The bar is completely empty.

533
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,917
I'm watching Charlie do his
thing, and it's good, man.

534
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,118
It's, like, good.

535
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,554
It looks like we did tip, Deandra.

536
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,090
We might as well sin and get high.

537
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,092
I mean, I'm a sinner, too, right?

538
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:14,093
Oh, ho, ho.

539
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:16,796
Oh, Mac's the best.

540
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:17,796
Oh, I love him.

541
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:18,797
Isn't he?

542
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
Also, I'm pro-abortion, so I'm
probably going straight to hell.

543
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,001
Oh, oh, and I got fat.

544
00:17:23,003 --> 00:17:24,001
I'm much fatter than Mac.

545
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:27,071
You're so fat, and, uh...
♪ Oh, big, fat, big, fat Big, fat titties

546
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,005
Big, fat ass. ♪

547
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,007
You got big, fat titties.

548
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,008
♪ Mm-hmm, over here... ♪

549
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,310
And I like to kill
babies, unborn babies.

550
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm not exactly sure how that
conversation went, but I imagine

551
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:37,715
it was along those lines.

552
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:41,052
The point is, six weeks later,
they dropped a bomb on me.

553
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,055
We're not idiots.

554
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,824
Of course, I'm going to take the
precaution of boiling the blood

555
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:45,758
before I use it.

556
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,593
Yeah, now, that goes without saying.

557
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:48,595
No, no, no.

558
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,431
It does not matter if
you boil it, Charlie.

559
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,199
You can't... you can't replace
Frank's blood with bags of blood

560
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,134
that you found behind a hospital.

561
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:55,135
But... wait, wait.

562
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:56,136
It just won't work.

563
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:57,971
Dennis, he's not going
to replace my blood.

564
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:59,807
He's going to add to it
to make me more virile.

565
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:00,641
I'm just pumping more in.

566
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:01,642
Yeah.

567
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:04,379
So you're just going to be
bursting at the seams with blood?

568
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,380
Yeah.

569
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:06,381
Oh, yeah.

570
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:07,382
Hey-o. What's up, bitches?

571
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,383
I did it.

572
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,052
I'm 200 pounds.

573
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,052
I'm as big as my avatar.

574
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:12,587
What's an avatar?

575
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,656
You know the avatar that we're
going to get to do all of

576
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,791
our work for us, so I can go
sailing, and-and Dee can tell

577
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,461
her stupid jokes, and Dennis can
pour more acid on his face.

578
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,461
Are we still doing that?

579
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,463
No. We-We gave that plan
up a really long time ago.

580
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,932
Is that why you've been stuffing
your face for six weeks?

581
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,634
Yeah. I've been trying to get as
big as my avatar, so we don't tip.

582
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,861
Dude, that was, like,
a million plans ago.

583
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,005
All of us, including you-- we've
been engaged in many other plans

584
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:35,939
and schemes since then.

585
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:36,940
Wh-Where have you been?

586
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,468
You guys dropped the tipping plan?

587
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:39,148
Yeah.

588
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,545
I thought we were just putting it on
the back burner until I hit two hundo.

589
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,593
Why do you think we've been
calling you fat this entire time?

590
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:48,141
Wh... Why wouldn't somebody
tell me that we dropped the plan?

591
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,398
Stop chewing on food and
start thinking about what's

592
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:52,700
going on in the bar, and then you...

593
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:53,866
Don't-Don't make fun of me, okay?

594
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,639
I'm-I'm busting my ass out
there trying to do the avatar

595
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,201
plan, and-and now you
guys are laughing at me.

596
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:01,154
But you have candy
coming out of your pocket.

597
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:03,523
I was hungry.

598
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:04,558
I was hungry.

599
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,093
Don't laugh at me.

600
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,094
Don't laugh at me!

601
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,195
Don't laugh at me.

602
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,199
Is he trying to rip his shirt off?

603
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,200
What are you doing?

604
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,202
You guys are going to hell, okay?

605
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,204
You guys are going to hell.

606
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,205
Don't laugh at me.

607
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:18,206
What are you doing?

608
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,207
"Don't laugh at me."

609
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,838
And that's it.

610
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,146
So, now you understand.

611
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:24,647
I understand none of it.

612
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,416
Father, my friends totally boned me.

613
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:30,085
They became successful,
egotistical monsters.

614
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,454
They forced me into this avatar
thing, and now they're totally

615
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:33,388
ditching the plan.

616
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,790
But it's all about the avatar.

617
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:35,858
The beefcake avatar.

618
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,894
But you weren't going to understand
that unless I told you the whole story.

619
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,897
I'm going to be perfectly honest.

620
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,165
I still don't know what
you want me to do.

621
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,368
Okay, um, let me start at the
beginning, because clearly,

622
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,303
you didn't understand it.

623
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:50,074
No, no, no, no, no, no
,hat won't be necessary.

624
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:53,878
Uh, if, uh... if I smite your friends
and absolve you, will you leave?

625
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,879
Yeah.

626
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,082
You're absolved, and
your friends are smited.

627
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,050
In the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Spirit, please leave.

628
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:00,753
Okay, great.

629
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:03,089
Oh, um, when should I see the results?

630
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,973
What are you talking about?

631
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:06,326
Well, when does the spell kick in?

632
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,795
Wh-When is God going to shed
some of this weight for me?

633
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:09,896
Six weeks.

634
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:10,897
Great.

635
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,232
Not hard. Perfect.

636
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:16,047
Uh, glory unto you, ghost man in
the sky, that created us all and

637
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,099
pre-determines everything.

638
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:19,123
I'll see you in six weeks.
