1
00:00:01,427 --> 00:00:03,825
My God, for the love of God,
there's two more of 'em.

2
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:05,653
I mean, it's giving me indigestion.

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,220
- Yeah, man.
- I'm tired of looking at it.

4
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:09,004
And where are they
even coming from, dude?

5
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:10,702
It's that new salon that
opened up down the street.

6
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:12,007
I thought it was gonna
be good for business,

7
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,748
- but this is hard to look at.
- I don't even understand

8
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:16,142
- why you guys give a shit.
- Why do we give a shit?

9
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:17,796
- Yeah.
- These women have mutilated themselves, Dee.

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,232
It's an abomination.

11
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:20,625
Once you go down that road, it's,

12
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:22,714
you... there's no turning back.

13
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,064
It's just, like,
the dumbest hat, too, like...

14
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:27,240
A hat? Are you talking about their hair?

15
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:29,590
That's hair? Oh, my...
I thought that was, like,

16
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:30,722
a little comedy hat or something.

17
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,072
That's their actual hair...
Why would anyone do that?

18
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:35,596
Wait a second. Poppins?

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,206
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God, it's Poppins!

20
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,078
Poppins! He came back!

21
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,862
My dog came back!

22
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,081
How the hell is that dog still alive?

23
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:43,299
Yeah, Mac, why don't you just

24
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,823
put that poor thing out of its misery?

25
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,302
Put him down? What, are you crazy?

26
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,869
This is my dog, Dee. I love him.

27
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:49,479
Well, he doesn't love you.

28
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:50,655
Comes around every three or four years,

29
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:52,308
eats a bunch of batteries or whatever,

30
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,610
takes a giant dump on the floor,
and then leaves again.

31
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:56,748
Dee, Poppins comes and goes
as he pleases

32
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,623
'cause that's his right as a male.

33
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,664
- Mm.
- Right?

34
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,709
- Women are never gonna get that.
- They'll never get it.

35
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:03,015
Yep. We are hunter-gatherers, Dee.

36
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:04,669
And if we decide to leave,
we're gonna leave.

37
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:07,672
- Yeah, 'cause that's nature. That's tradition.
- That's bullshit.

38
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:08,803
Traditional roles are ridiculous,

39
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,326
and they're made up by men.

40
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,562
If I want to have a baby
and then abandon that baby,

41
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:13,808
I have the right to do that.

42
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:16,898
- Oh...
- A woman abandoning her child?

43
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,421
- Yeah, that's awful, Dee.
- That's cheap.

44
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:19,858
And it's not natural.
You know what I mean?

45
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:20,902
Like those haircuts. I mean, they...

46
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:22,904
that's traditionally a man's look.

47
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,558
Women can't just adopt it.

48
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:25,820
You know? I mean, look, it's one thing

49
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,692
for, like,
a 60-year-old art critic to do it,

50
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:29,781
but, I mean, these are young,
sexually viable women

51
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,913
making themselves no longer
sexually attractive to me,

52
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,524
and that upsets the
natural balance of things.

53
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:35,874
- Mm.
- What? No.

54
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,093
If women want to get short,
ugly, lesbian haircuts,

55
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:40,792
then they deserve to do that
because it's their body

56
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,445
and, therefore, their choice.

57
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,751
Oh, you're gonna make it about that?

58
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,710
You know what?
Killing babies is wrong, Dee,

59
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:46,928
and God forbids it.

60
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:49,104
Oh, God.

61
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:50,236
Here comes another one.

62
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,455
It's too much!

63
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:55,212
_

64
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,307
I'm telling you, man,
something is wrong with Poppins.

65
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,832
His belly's all big.
I've never seen him so run-down.

66
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,181
I mean, it's not like he's
never been sick before.

67
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,704
You remember the time he
drank an entire pot of coffee?

68
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:25,706
- That wasn't good.
- No, this is different, dude.

69
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,577
- Yeah.
- This is... Look, check this out.

70
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,973
- Oh, yeah. That's not good.
- Nothing. Nothing.

71
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:33,085
I mean, it's just like...

72
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,585
Where'd you get the air horn?

73
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,413
Oh, I-I picked it up
at the hardware store

74
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,806
- when you were grabbing coffee.
- Yeah.

75
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,920
Yeah. Why?

76
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:42,288
I want to jump-start Poppins's system.

77
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,942
You know? But it's not working.
Maybe if I do it longer?

78
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:45,770
- I'll do it super long, huh?
- Uh, you know what?

79
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,859
- What if I feed him my coffee, right?
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

80
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,296
You blast him with the air horn,
a-and that might wake him up.

81
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,298
Oh, and maybe
I'll scream into the other ear.

82
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,516
Okay, yeah. Give it a whirl.

83
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,866
Please don't.

84
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,737
Oh, uh, am I not doing it right?

85
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,869
Do you want to give it a go?

86
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,132
Uh, no, I don't.
And, yes, you're doing it correctly,

87
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:02,787
I just prefer you not
feed your dog coffee

88
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,730
and blow an air horn
repeatedly into its ear canal.

89
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,139
Hey, look, if that doesn't
make this dog less sleepy,

90
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,881
- nothing's gonna.
- Well, to be clear,

91
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:13,014
uh, sleepiness is not Poppins' problem.

92
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,922
Oh, no. Is it a tumor?

93
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,018
If it's not, could you say it
in that really funny

94
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:19,238
Arnold Schwarzenegger voice
that's, like, so funny?

95
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,674
- "It's not a tumor."
- You know what I mean? And that always, like... Yeah.

96
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,110
- "It's not a tumor."
- It's funny when he says it, too.

97
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,329
Unless it is a tumor,

98
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,679
- and then it's not gonna be funny.
- Is it?

99
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:28,464
Well, uh, there's good news
and there's bad news. Right?

100
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,251
Uh, the good news is
that Poppins is pregnant.

101
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:34,035
Wait. Poppins is a girl?

102
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,647
Oh, you didn't know
your dog was a female?

103
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,346
Oh, nah, I-I could never
get underneath that hind leg

104
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,609
- to check.
- You don't want to try to get under Poppins.

105
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:44,611
I mean, one time I tried
to give him a belly scratch

106
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:47,396
- and he bit my thumbnail clean off.
- He's a monster.

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,963
- Uh, "she."
- Say what now? - Huh?

108
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:50,704
"She-She's a monster."

109
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,446
I can't believe that Poppins
is gonna be a father.

110
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,143
- A mother.
- What?

111
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,624
- A mother?
- He is?

112
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:02,455
Hmm... Okay.
Uh, do you two not understand gender?

113
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:04,587
- No, I mean...
- Well,

114
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,025
- we don't really do gender at our bar anymore.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:08,940
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, gender's so, like, old school.

116
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,724
- Like, I-I don't identify...
- Um, I'm so sorry

117
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,944
to tell you, uh, the bad news,

118
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,643
is that given Poppins' advanced age,

119
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:21,822
I'm afraid that she most likely
will not survive the delivery.

120
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,085
- He won't?
- Again, she.

121
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,044
And, uh, yeah.

122
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,611
I-I don't think
I've ever seen a dog this old.

123
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:32,615
It's a miracle that she was
even able to get pregnant,

124
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,662
so when she gives birth,

125
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:38,970
she will most likely die.

126
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,626
Well, you got to kill
those babies, then.

127
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:45,454
- Uh...
- What? Dude, what the hell?

128
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,065
I thought you were all
pro-life and everything.

129
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,503
I am, but this is different.
This affects me.

130
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:53,854
Uh, I'm so sorry, but we don't
perform that procedure here.

131
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:55,725
We can talk to a, like,
a doctor, not a nurse.

132
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,510
That's a good idea.
Do you have any doctors here?

133
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:58,728
- Let's go.
- I'm a...

134
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,121
Let's go. We'll go find a man.

135
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,949
Okay.

136
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:04,135
Got some information for you.

137
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:05,692
- You're gonna want this information.
- Great hair. Keep the hair

138
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:07,041
- the way it is.
- Very important information, honestly.

139
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,217
- Keep your hair the way it is. It's really great.
- Yeah.

140
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,697
- Oh. Oh... Hi!
- Hi... G-Going the wrong way.

141
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,220
- You going in here to get the... Yeah.
- I was.

142
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,135
Check this out: um, uh, did you know

143
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,137
that hair only grows about six inches

144
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,573
over the course of an entire year?

145
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,924
Did you realize that?
Isn't that mind-blowing?

146
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,229
- Think about that for a second. You know?
- Mm.

147
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:23,231
Here. Grab that for me, if you will.

148
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,929
- Oh, my.
- Yeah, it's something else.

149
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:26,931
- You can't get your hair cut. You don't want to do that.
- Um, now I'll tell you something.

150
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:29,237
With luxurious locks like yours,
it could take, oh,

151
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,936
- three, four years to grow back to its current length. Yeah.
- Yeah, if it ever grows back.

152
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,894
- Okay. Thanks.
- Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.

153
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:36,462
If that doesn't convince you,
there's more. Um...

154
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,943
Listen, are you familiar with
the television series Felicity,

155
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:41,032
- starring Keri Russell? Yeah.
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

156
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,164
- Well, this is Keri Russell right here.
- Beautiful.

157
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,732
- Look at her.Beautiful. Gorgeous.
- Beautiful girl. Yeah, gorgeous.

158
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:46,951
- Yep.
- Millions of adoring fans,

159
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,779
hit television show, you know,
and then she went and did this.

160
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,999
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

161
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,479
- Look at that. Oh, God.
- What a mess.

162
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:55,133
- Shocking, isn't it?
- Still pretty.

163
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,744
With this one tragic decision,
Keri Russell a-alienated

164
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,964
all of her fans,
she got her show canceled,

165
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,183
and, man, she was never
heard of ever again.

166
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,403
Yeah, but Keri Russell
works all the time.

167
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:06,187
Yeah, now, does she still play women?

168
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,797
Look, leave me alone, creep.

169
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,799
- Probably in a cape or something.
- Well, no, no, hold on.

170
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,192
You're about to make
a huge mistake, lady.

171
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:13,107
- You don't want to do this. Man.
- Hey. - She got in.

172
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,588
- What is this? What are you guys doing?
- One got away.

173
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:18,156
- We let her go.
- Well, Dee, we are educating the public is what we're doing.

174
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,548
- We're trying to help these women.
- Oh, my God.

175
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,115
Will you please leave
these poor women alone?

176
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,988
They're clearly bored and
lonely and-and-and needing

177
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,599
to do something extreme in order
to make themselves feel special.

178
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,514
Listen. Take this one for example.

179
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,950
You don't get a monkey cut like that

180
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,430
unless you're broken inside.

181
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,954
I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?

182
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,173
No, sweetie, I'm talking about you.

183
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,609
I'm using you as an example.

184
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:39,438
I support your choice to look
like whatever kind of primate

185
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:42,397
or simian species you choose,
because it is your choice.

186
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,095
Okay? You know what?

187
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,835
Go full baboon, girl. I support you.

188
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,270
No. Dee, Dee, you're not being rational.

189
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:49,574
Can you at least acknowledge

190
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,667
the fact that men should have
some say in what women do

191
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,104
with their hair?
I mean, for Christ's sakes,

192
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,583
we're the ones that have
to look at it all day!

193
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,585
No, Dennis. I won't acknowledge that.

194
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,023
You have no say. In fact, you know what?

195
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:00,909
I'm gonna get the haircut.

196
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,853
Don't do it, Dee. You're gonna,
you're gonna look hideous.

197
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,247
I know I will. I don't have
the face or the body to support

198
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,814
a haircut like that,
but I'm gonna do it anyway,

199
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,033
because I can.

200
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,035
Because I choose to,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

201
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:12,471
- You don't do it.
- Excuse me.

202
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,255
You do not do it.
You go back to the bar.

203
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,313
I command you!

204
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:17,432
Dee.

205
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,782
You're not being serious enough.

206
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,436
- Oh...
- One monkey cut, please!

207
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,655
Oh, God.

208
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,266
You... you bitch.

209
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,616
Yeah, so,

210
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,663
what we'd like you to do is kill
the dog puppies, if you could.

211
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:32,056
Hey. Don't-don't say "kill," though.

212
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,275
Uh, sorry, murder them, if possible?

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,408
- Say, uh... Uh, no, say, uh...
- Uh, sorry, my friend has a...

214
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,019
- "...terminate the embryos."
- To terminate...

215
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,848
- Yeah, so if you could terminate the puppies' embryos?
- Yeah.

216
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:43,415
- Yeah. You know what? Come on. Let me just-let me...
- Uh-huh. Sorry.

217
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,504
- Hang on one second. My friend wants to talk to you.
- Yeah. I'll do it.

218
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:48,594
Yes, hi. Yes, we-we need you
to perform this dog abortion,

219
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,031
and if you don't, my dog is gonna die.

220
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,860
And he-he-he's not gonna
be able to survive the...

221
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:57,201
Yes, I'm-I'm aware that a
boy dog can't have puppies.

222
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:59,083
- What's with this? I...
- I... Yes. Look,

223
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,954
it's a little bit confusing
because he used to be...

224
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:02,390
Look, there was a transition
at some point, all right?

225
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,871
- He had a sex change.
- We see past gender at our bar.

226
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,264
And I don't... They hung up.

227
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:08,092
- That's the tenth one.
- You know what?

228
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,658
The problem is we-we can't
get any doctors on the phone.

229
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,530
- I know.
- You know? You're always talking to a secretary.

230
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,532
- I know, it's just...
- Puts you on the phone with some other female secretary,

231
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,621
- and it's like...
- And honestly, I tune them out,

232
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,623
because I can't...
they get so high up in the register.

233
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,885
Yeah.

234
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:21,627
She's gone too far! She has no idea

235
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,309
of the ramifications of what
her actions...

236
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,327
Whoa. Frankie.

237
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:29,461
Take it easy, buddy.
Your valve's getting all worked up.

238
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,332
That's not good.

239
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:32,768
Hey, your valve's acting up...
You know what?

240
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,205
Here, here... eat some cat food.

241
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,579
Come on, settle down.

242
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,339
You-you got to get that valve down, man.

243
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,732
- You got to calm that down, all right?
- Okay...

244
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,473
- Neutralize it out with the cat food.
- Let me have it.

245
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:43,475
All right, walk me
through what's happening here.

246
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:44,867
- It's Dee.
- Yeah?

247
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,956
Yeah, she's gonna do it.
She's gonna cut her hair off.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,524
Dennis... put me in charge...

249
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:53,876
of making sure she doesn't
go through with this madness.

250
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,357
Ooh, Frankie, that valve is bad, man.
That is backed up.

251
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,230
- You-you drinking enough beer, bud?
- No.

252
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,753
Okay. Let-Let's get you another beer

253
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,189
- or something.
- Let me have a brew,

254
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,464
and pop me another can of this cat food.

255
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:04,583
- It's working.
- Yeah.

256
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,280
We got to settle that valve down, buddy.

257
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,327
Hey, Frank,

258
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,068
you know anybody
that'll do a dog abortion?

259
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,767
Yeah, I got a guy.

260
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,513
Yeah. There you go. Take a look.

261
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,515
You seriously want to buy me a car

262
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:24,907
as long as I don't cut my hair?

263
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:27,127
Yeah, and we should look
at the convertibles.

264
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:28,259
I want the wind blowing through

265
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,913
those long, beautiful locks of yours.

266
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,132
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

267
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:33,394
This has nothing to do with a haircut

268
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:35,918
and everything to do with
you controlling my body.

269
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:38,225
It's got everything to do
with a haircut, Deandra.

270
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,227
Look at this.

271
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,402
What is this?

272
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,013
That's me when I was young.

273
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,232
I was like Samson.

274
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,408
I had hair down to my butt crack.

275
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,410
I looked like a Greek god.

276
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:50,542
You look like a bridge troll.

277
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,761
Well, the point is, I cut it all off.

278
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,286
I-I needed the money and I read an ad...

279
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,811
for a toupee company that said
they would give good money

280
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:01,030
for real hair, so I bought in.

281
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:04,425
But I shaved it all off to the nub.
It never grew back.

282
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:05,992
And-and, plus, when I think about it,

283
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:08,429
I get a... pain in my stomach

284
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,649
and I... gastronomical.

285
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,433
- Oh, God.
- And I burp.

286
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:15,567
That's not how hair works.
Or gastrointestinal tracts.

287
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,265
I want to show you something else.

288
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:20,659
What?

289
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,356
There it is.

290
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,445
There what is, Frank?

291
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:27,231
That's my old hair.

292
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:29,015
He-He's given it a good home.

293
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,799
He takes care of it.

294
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,237
Probably better than I would've
taken care of it myself.

295
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,108
- Wha...?
- I come by time to time

296
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,458
to check it out, see how it's doing.

297
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,025
Oh, my God.

298
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,244
Ah, here he comes.

299
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:41,332
Don't-don't say anything,

300
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,464
because I don't want
to make it feel bad.

301
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,031
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, here's my guy.

302
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,380
- Hi. How you doing?
- How you doing, Frankie?

303
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:48,034
- Good to see you.
- Very nice to see you.

304
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:50,819
I love this guy.
He's bought, like, five cars off of me.

305
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:52,386
- You know?
- I hope you're using that money

306
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,997
for high-end shampoos and conditioners.

307
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,696
S... Always with the shampoo jokes.

308
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,829
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

309
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,484
Uh, so, anyway,
you here to buy something today?

310
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:04,877
- Yes. Yeah.
- No! No.

311
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,313
I-I...
you're not buying me a car, Frank.

312
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,445
You can't control me

313
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:10,274
with your cars and your threats
of male pattern baldness.

314
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:12,101
That-that was an unrelated burp.

315
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:14,278
I had four beers on the way here,
I'll have you know.

316
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:15,627
I'm getting the haircut. I'm getting it.

317
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,846
Don't do it, Deandra. You'll regret it!

318
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,326
I'm telling you!

319
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,067
What was that all about?

320
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:23,069
Just trying to save a life.

321
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,245
Oh. The wind's kicking up.

322
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,813
You better get inside.
I don't like to see her struggle.

323
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:29,206
Okay.

324
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:34,515
You sure this is the place?

325
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,865
Yeah. This is where Frank
said to meet the guy, so...

326
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,519
- What up?
- Oh, hey, Z.

327
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,738
- Hey.
- How you doing, man?

328
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,522
- What you boys up to?
- Uh, we're waiting

329
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,524
on a doctor that Frank's
hooking us up with.

330
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,091
Yeah, that's me, homie.

331
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,962
- Oh.
- You're a doctor?

332
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,355
Straight up.

333
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,922
Come on. No, you're not.

334
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:51,880
Bitch, you don't think I'm a doctor?

335
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,753
I was a medic in Desert Storm.

336
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:58,452
I did Doctors Without Borders,
I saved mad lives.

337
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,889
See, you racist.
That's what the problem is.

338
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,224
I'm so sorry, Z. I didn't have any idea.

339
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,893
- That's impressive, yeah.
- Sorry. Sorry.

340
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,679
Bitch, I'm just playing with you.

341
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:08,984
I ain't no motherfucking doctor.

342
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,249
Oh!

343
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,293
- Okay. All right.
- Are you serious?

344
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,121
I do still feel bad, though.

345
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:16,340
- I feel terrible.
- I feel bad, too, because I feel

346
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,080
- like I was exposed.
- Lesson learned.

347
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:20,561
- Lesson learned. That was good.
- I was... My racism was exposed.

348
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:21,736
But I do fuck with dogs,

349
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,477
- so tell me what's up.
- Oh, okay. Good.

350
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:26,175
- So, uh, Poppins is sick.
- Right.

351
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,352
Yeah, and there's
a bunch of babies in there.

352
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,919
Oh, snap. Okay. Right.

353
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,400
Now, the vet said that if he gives
birth, he's gonna die.

354
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:35,533
Oh, so you want me
to scoop them babies out

355
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,708
so your dog can die.

356
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,928
- Uh, n-no. The, the opposite, actually.
- Okay.

357
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,975
You want me to scoop them
puppies out and chuck 'em

358
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,978
and then put your dog out its misery.

359
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:47,501
- Uh, no. No.
- No. Uh-uh.

360
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:49,547
No, uh, we want you to kill the babies

361
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,418
and keep this dog alive.

362
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:53,377
Okay, word. I can get with that.

363
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,205
Yeah, is there a version,
like, where no dog dies?

364
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:57,555
Yo, son, that's hard to tell.

365
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:59,339
I made dogs make babies,

366
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,820
but I ain't never taken
no babies out the dog.

367
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:03,169
Oh, you're a breeder.

368
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,519
- Right.
- That's why Frank hooked us up.

369
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:08,174
- Yeah, yeah. I breed dogs.
- Nice.

370
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:10,002
- I groom dogs. I fight dogs.
- Nice.

371
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:11,351
- Oh. Mm.
- I ain't never abort

372
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,397
no dog, but we can get it done.

373
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,486
Poke around in one of them trash cans,

374
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,662
try to find an Allen wrench.

375
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,188
Yeah, I'm starting to think
this is a mistake, man.

376
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:23,972
I don't think he's qualified to do this.

377
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,496
- But...
- Yeah, I-I don't know.

378
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,932
I don't know what
else we're gonna do, man.

379
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,412
I mean, we got to save Poppins.

380
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:30,544
Oh, shit. Wait. Who's this?

381
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,067
Oh... Oh, my God.

382
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,852
Wait a second. Charlie...

383
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,070
I think this is the real Poppins!

384
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,594
That's Poppins, isn't it?

385
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:37,943
I was wondering why I didn't have

386
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,510
to pop this dog's eye
back in its socket.

387
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,381
That dog has a very solid eye.
It was very mysterious why...

388
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:43,209
Oh, my God. Yeah, look how dirty he is.

389
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,211
Oh, look. Oh, look at this.
He came back.

390
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:46,647
He's getting all nose-deep

391
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,215
- in, uh... in her goodies there, so...
- Oh, my God. Wait a second.

392
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:50,608
Charlie,

393
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:53,219
maybe the puppies inside
of this dog are Poppins's!

394
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,221
Oh, my God. Poppins is the dad?

395
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:56,440
Yes!

396
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:57,658
- Uh...
- That is so cute.

397
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:58,790
- Yeah.
- He came back

398
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,226
- to take care of his family.
- He did.

399
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,967
He likes to take... Oh, no, he did not.
He did not.

400
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,490
- There he goes.
- He wanted the blanket.

401
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,405
Yeah, he's a survivor. He's gonna

402
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:06,467
take what he needs.

403
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,943
He's gonna do what he's gonna do. Wow.

404
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,583
- Bye, buddy.
- Bye, Poppins!

405
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,063
All right. See you in a few years.

406
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,197
Mm-hmm.

407
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:13,457
All right. What are we gonna do

408
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,241
- with this piece of shit?
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,342
Listen here, you monster.

410
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:32,301
Okay, well, if you see her,
can you call me? I'm just really

411
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:34,826
freaking out. It's not like her at all.

412
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:36,871
Um...

413
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,612
I'm so sorry. Um, can I help you?

414
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,424
Yeah.

415
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,704
Yes. I'm sorry, the...

416
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,837
Your tears were unexpected. I, uh...

417
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,708
Yeah.

418
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,318
Sometimes I find it
very arousing, tears,

419
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:50,537
but this time, I wasn't...

420
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:51,669
I-I wasn't coming in-in that zone.

421
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:53,932
You know what I mean? So, I, uh, was...

422
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:56,282
I just wasn't ready for it.
I was... I was gonna do a th...

423
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:57,936
I could switch gears, though.
You want to do...?

424
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,634
We could do a...
This could be an arousing thing. I...

425
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:02,288
What is happening?

426
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,638
Right. Sorry. Uh...

427
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:07,467
Yeah, so, no. I...
No, I came here with a plan, and, um...

428
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:10,339
Yes, I'm gonna stick
to that plan, so... Sorry.

429
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,691
- I'd like a haircut, please.
- Oh.

430
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,867
Yeah, sure. Um, if you can just
leave your name and number.

431
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,085
What do you mean "yes"?

432
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,696
- I can...
- Sorry. What?

433
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:21,394
I can make you an appointment if
you leave your name and number.

434
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:22,395
- Right on.
- And I can

435
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,311
- give you...
- You cut men's hair?

436
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,531
Yeah. We cut anyone's hair who needs it.

437
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,664
Good. As it should be.

438
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,711
- Good.
- Yeah.

439
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,150
- So...
- Are you okay?

440
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:42,589
You won't outsmart me.

441
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,722
Sorry. I-I...

442
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:46,767
I thought you were gonna
say that you only cut

443
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,769
women's hair,
and I was gonna claim discrimination

444
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:51,424
to get you shut... it doesn't matter.

445
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,558
I have to admit, you've-you've
put me a bit out of sorts. I...

446
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,734
With the, with the, the tears and the...

447
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:59,650
arousal and your face and words. I...

448
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,129
Can we start over? Uh...

449
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:02,391
Do you want an appointment?

450
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,785
No! No.

451
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,745
I-I... Because I don't want
a-a-a haircut from a butcher.

452
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,920
All right? I'm not gonna get butchered

453
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:10,574
like you've butchered
these poor women's hairs.

454
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:11,705
- Are you insane?
- No.

455
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:13,359
Look, I can be reasonable, okay?

456
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:14,926
I don't expect to save
everybody from this,

457
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,319
but I can save one person, all right?

458
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:18,525
My sister Deandra Reynolds.

459
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:19,583
She-she has an appointment here,

460
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,193
and I want it stricken from the record.

461
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:22,803
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
- Look,

462
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:26,459
you don't understand, okay? She's...
she's my twin sister, all right?

463
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:28,374
Fr-From a genetic standpoint,
I mean, her hair is just

464
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,202
as much mine as it is hers,
you know what I mean?

465
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,726
I-I-I... I have every right
to stop her from killing it.

466
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,728
Okay, I don't know what's going on here,

467
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:36,382
but I don't have time for this.

468
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,731
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're very busy

469
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,907
destroying young people's lives,
aren't you?

470
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,954
Yeah. Doesn't surprise me
it's reduced you to tears.

471
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:46,827
I'm crying because
my dog is lost, asshole.

472
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,177
What's your dog look like?

473
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,968
Oh, shit.

474
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:03,757
Well, this all worked out

475
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,803
- pretty well, didn't it?
- Yeah, yeah. - Well, yeah.

476
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:07,979
I can't believe how quick
you gave up Poppins's puppies,

477
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:09,676
though, you know?
You didn't even think about keeping 'em.

478
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,286
Well, that's a lot of responsibility,

479
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,853
- Charlie, right?
- Yeah, that's true.

480
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,203
And plus, there's no doggy
paternity test to actually prove

481
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,770
that they were Poppy's
puppies in the first place.

482
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:17,871
That's true, too.

483
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,425
You know? But, hey,

484
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:21,383
if Poppins wants to stop by
and say, "What's up?"

485
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:22,646
and, like, be a dad for while...

486
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:23,864
- Right.
- ...he's gonna.

487
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,300
- Exactly.
- Or he won't.

488
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,606
Yeah, that's how I do. That's how I do.

489
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,608
But, guys, seriously,
we got to stay vigilant, okay?

490
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,175
I mean, yes, we were able to stop Dee

491
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,655
from doing something horrible.

492
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,745
But, you know, we can't rest
until every single woman is free

493
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,443
from the choice of ruining
their lives forever.

494
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:38,705
- Mm.
- So what are we gonna do?

495
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:39,750
I was thinking we use shame.

496
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,881
It's a great motivator.

497
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,231
Hello... oh, my God!

498
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,668
- Oh!
- Oh!

499
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:47,496
- Oh! Aah!
- Oh, my God!

500
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,411
- Dee, what have you done?!
- Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:50,891
I told you I was gonna get the cut!

502
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,110
- Goddamn it!
- Oh.

503
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,852
But then I went into the salon,
and the woman refused to see me.

504
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:55,983
She refused, she said,

505
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,550
'cause she was-she was
doing some sort of trade

506
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:59,334
in a dog-kidnapped situation.
I don't know.

507
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,250
I ended up having to do it
all by myself! That's right!

508
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:03,329
Listen, l-listen.

509
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,471
- It looks... terrible.
- I...

510
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:06,907
- So bad.
- I mean, really, really bad.

511
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:09,649
I know it looks terrible!
The scissors were dirty,

512
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:10,868
and they weren't even sharp.

513
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:12,304
But now it's done. It's done now.

514
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:13,827
There's no turning back.

515
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,089
What have I done? What have I done?

516
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,918
I've-I've forced my sister
into a back-alley chop.

517
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:20,051
Guys, I think we-we need
to realize something.

518
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:21,530
We're never gonna be able to stop women

519
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:23,315
from doing whatever the hell
they want with their own bodies.

520
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,925
- Thank you!
- Okay?

521
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,666
And if we can't stop
them from making stupid

522
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,712
and selfish choices,
then we need to give them a place

523
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,887
to go to be stupid and selfish.

524
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,366
- Thank you.
- Where it's safe.

525
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,803
- Yes!
- Where they won't do bullshit like this.

526
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,935
- It's bullshit!
- This is a bullshit haircut!

527
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:35,936
I know!

528
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,809
Okay, guys, here's something else, too.

529
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,898
I don't care about any of this,
really, you know?

530
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,943
If I'm being honest,
I don't care that much, either.

531
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:43,901
- Right?
- Oh...

532
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,293
- Like, who gives a shit?
- Yeah.

533
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:46,817
Yeah, I guess I don't really
care that much, either.

534
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,905
- What?! No, you... No.
- I don't know,

535
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:49,776
it just...
it's annoying, but I don't care.

536
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,952
We don't really care.

537
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,301
Why did you guys make such
a big deal about it, then?

538
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,739
Well, uh, you know,
that's, like, a guy thing.

539
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:56,740
Well, 'cause we're-we're
used to being in charge,

540
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:57,958
and we want to make sure that...

541
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,786
You did! You cared! You cared so much,

542
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,571
and then I did it,
and now what am I supposed to do?

543
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:05,183
- I care. I know what to do.
- You do?

544
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:06,793
I got a guy.

545
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,754
- Hey.
- Oh.

546
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,756
How that wig feel, Dee?

547
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,192
- Really good.
- Oh.

548
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:15,628
It feels great. Thank you, Z.

549
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:18,892
Now, Dee, just remember that
one day you may get a call

550
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:20,981
from the woman who gave
birth to that hair.

551
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:25,594
And, uh,
I would consider some visitations.

552
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,335
Nah, she ain't got to worry about that.

553
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,642
I groomed that shit off a border collie.

554
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,078
Well, then you're good.

555
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,690
Hey. Might be some fleas
up in there, but she good.
