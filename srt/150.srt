1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:03,977
101.3 WNFY weather report.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,675
It's a scorcher out there,
already 102 degrees.

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,113
Residents are being asked
to keep their thermostats

4
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:11,808
at 76 degrees to conserve energy.

5
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:14,792
Ah, man, global warming.
It's out of control.

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,010
Yeah. It's hot, baby.

7
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:18,665
Guys, we don't really have to
worry about global warming,

8
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:21,276
because... yes,
is the Earth getting unbearably hot?

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,627
Of course it is.
But it's all a part of God's plan.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,367
Look, if God wants
to roast us like turkeys,

11
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,760
there's got to be a good reason for it.

12
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:29,154
That's easy for you to say;
you're young.

13
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,373
You know who's gonna get hurt the worst?

14
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,375
- Old people.
- Old people?

15
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:34,812
- Yeah.
- No, it's the younger generation that's gonna suffer

16
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:36,422
- from global warming the most.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

17
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:37,989
Listen,
there's no reason to fight, okay?

18
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,426
We're actually living at a
very exciting time right now.

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,862
I mean, we're all finally in agreement

20
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,821
that climate change is real.

21
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:45,866
Well, yes,
the 25 years of climate science

22
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,781
finally caught up with my opinions,
and, Dennis,

23
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,828
when opinions meet facts,
that's when you get truth.

24
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:52,046
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

25
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,874
Yeah, yeah. But the good news is, hey,

26
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:55,223
for the first time I can remember,

27
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:57,225
we all have the same truth.

28
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:59,097
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

29
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,881
- That's nice, right? Yeah.
- How 'bout that?

30
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:01,969
And, look, while some people are saying,

31
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,536
"Look, we're staring down the barrel

32
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,973
of a global catastrophe here,"
that is true, but I think

33
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:08,497
if we all work together,
we can solve this problem.

34
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,691
Guys, we can beat the heat.

35
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,546

Guys?

48
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:49,843
Feeling that? Nice and cool, huh?

49
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,715
Turned the AC way down.

50
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:55,283
Yeah, I don't know why
we're wasting our AC on strangers.

51
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:56,894
No, Frank, we're not wasting it.

52
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:58,896
No-no-no-no.
We're adapting to climate change.

53
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,767
People are animals.

54
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,551
When push comes to shove,

55
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:04,815
- there's no "together."
- No-no-no, see, listen.

56
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,513
By-by-by cranking the AC
down below the recommended,

57
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:09,384
uh, settings, and getting the word out

58
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,125
that Paddy's has the best AC in town,

59
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,910
we're actually helping our business

60
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:14,738
and helping the environment.

61
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:15,956
No, that doesn't work. Shame's better.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,828
Like I do with my shoes,
you know what I mean?

63
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,960
How would I know what you mean?

64
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,136
My shoes that are made out
of recyclable materials.

65
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,747
I did a whole Instagram Story about it.

66
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,357
Talking about how great the shoes are,

67
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,880
making people feel stupid
for not having them.

68
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:28,316
You know, you remember.

69
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,755
Who the fuck do you think
is watching your... What?!

70
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,800
- Not-not one person on Earth is...
- Get out of here.

71
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:35,933
What are you talking about?
Plus, how is there any plastic

72
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:37,325
left in the ocean after they used it

73
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:39,327
to cover your gargantuan feet?

74
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,373
Yeah, big feet. Hey, guys, though,

75
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,809
we got a little bit of a problem.

76
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,290
Uh, there's, like, a,
I don't know, like, a backup

77
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,944
of the water lines or something.
The ice machine's broken.

78
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,162
We don't have any ice.

79
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:49,990
Oh, shit. Okay, well,
just, uh, call the store

80
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,557
and have them deliver some ice.

81
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,995
And make more waste by having
a big smoke-spewing truck

82
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,432
deliver ice to us when we could
just simply get off our asses

83
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,870
and go get it ourselves? Hey, guys,

84
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,350
listen, I just wanted to
talk about the importance

85
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:06,354
of not only talking the talk,
but also walking the walk.

86
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:08,966
Oh. As I'm saying that,
it's reminding me

87
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,012
I'm loving my new eco-friendly shoes.

88
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:15,125
See there? Not only
am I helping the environment,

89
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,169
I could also get some free swag

90
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:18,105
- if I keep it up, play my cards right.
- That's awesome.

91
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,454
You're such an awesome eco-warrior.

92
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:20,760
And since you want to walk the walk,

93
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:23,545
why don't you walk to the
store and pick us up some ice?

94
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:25,809
- I just might.
- Okay, then do it.

95
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,334
- Maybe I will.
- Get out and go!

96
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,467
Could even do an Instagram
Story about it on my way there.

97
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:33,991
Oh, super cool!

98
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:36,820
- Go!
- Fine. - Go, go and go

99
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,996
- and go and go and go and go and go, go, go and go.
- Fine!

100
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,215
Charlie, come with me;
I need someone to video me

101
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,651
so I look more professional.

102
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:44,001
I don't want to do that.

103
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:45,698
We'll do a Story about Purina,

104
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,831
tag them, and get you
a free case of cat food.

105
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,789
- Done.
- Hmm.

106
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,052
Did you see that, Frank?

107
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:54,054
If you incentivize somebody
to make the right decision,

108
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:56,056
you can get them to do
whatever you need them to do.

109
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,189
All right, what about me?
Where's my incentive?

110
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:00,931
Well, uh, how about
we lower that AC even more

111
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,802
and see if that helps you?

112
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:05,065
How would that help me?

113
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,068
Frank, what's the temperature
at which a certain body part's

114
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:11,463
small, smooth muscle cells contract,
thereby decreasing

115
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:14,858
the surface area of the skin,
causing that certain body part

116
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:18,078
to protrude in an unusual fashion?

117
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,080
65.7 degrees Fahrenheit.

118
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,822
- Make it so.
- I'll do it.

119
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,824
What are you guys talking about?

120
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:27,305
Nipples, Mac. Uh, nipples.

121
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,437
Hi.

122
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,833
Son of a bitch charged me $40
for a bag of ice, Charlie.

123
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:35,671
They... he's taking advantage
of this heat wave,

124
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,428
- jacking up the prices.
- Yeah, he's smart.

125
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:38,571
So what's going on with the feet?

126
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:39,593
- I see you limping here.
- Ah!

127
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,188
Yeah, you know what?
These shoes, they are,

128
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,450
they're the worst.

129
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:43,930
Well, my feet
are all blistered and swollen.

130
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:47,238
- Yeah?
- But they're so cute and totally on-brand.

131
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:49,022
- Uh-huh.
- What are you doing? Don't do the Story now.

132
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,328
Well, you told me
to shoot candid moments

133
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:52,330
- that seemed honest.
- I said staged moments

134
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:54,549
that looked candid and seemed honest.

135
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,900
All right, well, can we just
walk back to the bar? Let's go.

136
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,076
I-I don't know.
I honestly don't think I can walk back.

137
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,338
My feet are killing me.

138
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:02,035
Let's take the bus, then.

139
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,298
Do you have any idea how
much pollution a bus causes?

140
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:06,039
I don't know. Uh, three?

141
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:08,868
Three?

142
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,916
- Three what?
- Pollutions?

143
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,482
- All right, we're not...
- I-I'm not a scient...

144
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:15,636
- I'm not a scientist.
- We're not... You're not a scientist.

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,421
I get it.
We're not taking the bus, though,

146
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,640
because buses are wasteful and
more importantly disgusting.

147
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,773
You're just all crammed on
there with a bunch of mongrels

148
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:23,992
breathing directly into your mouth.
There's no room. No.

149
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,429
Plus it's the future, Charlie.

150
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,325
- We can just take a rideshare.
- Rideshare? Why... What?

151
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,390
Yeah. It's when a bunch of people
get the app,

152
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,784
and then y'all take the same
vehicle to different places.

153
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:34,829
Same vehicle, diff... so, like a bus.

154
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:37,092
Fine, but it's not a bus, it's a car.

155
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,834
- So less room.
- Okay. Uh-huh.

156
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,445
'Cause if we just take the bus...

157
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,272
- We're not taking a bus, Charlie!
- Okay.

158
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:45,449
- Taking the rideshare. Come on.
- All right. Well...

159
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:52,522
_

160
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,461
What the hell is this?
Hey, Frank, Frank, Frank.

161
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,753
- Hold on. What's-what's going on, man?
- What?

162
00:05:58,797 --> 00:05:59,888
I thought you turned the AC up?

163
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:00,889
- It's getting hot as hell.
- I did. I did,

164
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,204
but there's too many people here.

165
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,989
I can't offset the body heat.

166
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:06,470
- Hey, we got a problem.
- Yeah, I... yeah, I saw that.

167
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,515
What's with all the water, man?
What's going on here?

168
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,430
Oh, that is probably from

169
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,084
the ice machine breaking down.

170
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:14,303
The water got backed up and
maybe diverted over here.

171
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:15,609
But that's not what I'm talking about.

172
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,611
- What?
- Look.

173
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,422
The fish factory guys
heard about the AC.

174
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:21,461
Now they're hanging out.

175
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:24,009
- Nobody wants to go near them.
- Yeah, well, they're covered in fish parts.

176
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,865
They probably smell like shit.
Go kick them out, Mac.

177
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,708
Uh, well, they go to my church.

178
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:30,798
And if I kick them out,
then they'll tattle on me to God.

179
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:34,019
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

180
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,786
You know, Dennis,

181
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,544
I'm not very incentivized here.

182
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,590
These are not the nips I wanted.

183
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,505
Whoa, Frank. Come on, man.

184
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,624
Now is not the time for your racism.
This affects us all.

185
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:44,738
We're all in this together.

186
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:47,511
Talking about the nipples.
I don't see any.

187
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,947
- Oh. Right, right. Sorry. Your, um...
- Not... people.

188
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,601
Yeah, no, your track record
in that department

189
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,254
is, uh, it's not great.

190
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:54,082
Yeah, it's just that
his misogyny is stronger

191
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,693
- than his racism.
- In this case.

192
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:57,738
- In this case.
- All right, well, sorry for, uh, sorry

193
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,740
for jumping on you like that.
Um, we can figure this out.

194
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:02,569
- Of course. God will provide.
- Well, we will provide.

195
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,702
I'm looking for answers right now.
We will provide.

196
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,083
- I got an answer. God created us.
- Okay.

197
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:09,707
All right, you know what?
Look, um, I have an idea.

198
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,491
We'll adapt.

199
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,107
Hey, guys. Hey, why create an
even bigger carbon footprint

200
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:21,762
by taking stinky buses all
over town when you can just hop

201
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:24,765
in a, in a, in a rideshare,
in an electric vehicle?

202
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,668
I'm loving this ride, y'all.

203
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,334
And cut.

204
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,857
Stop saying "and cut," Charlie.
Just take your finger

205
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,642
off the button.
You don't have to say that.

206
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,513
Christ. Might as well be in a bus.

207
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:34,993
I am eating this guy's breath.

208
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:36,603
- Yeah.
- I mean, just straight up eating it.

209
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,431
- It's super hot in here, too.
- It's so hot.

210
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,781
- I'm boiling.
- Guy? Can you turn the AC up, please?

211
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,131
- We're dying back here.
- Uh, sorry, electric car.

212
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,916
AC kills the battery.

213
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,787
Okay, then just turn it on for a minute

214
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:48,354
and then turn it right back off.

215
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,747
Want me to open a window?

216
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,445
No. No, I actually don't
want hot air from the outside

217
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,534
blowing all over the place,
but thank you.

218
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:56,754
You want a breath mint or some gum?

219
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:58,103
I want some goddamn air conditioning.

220
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,626
What's some gum gonna do?

221
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,977
Well, when someone offers you gum,
it's usually a hint.

222
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:04,762
- That's him! That's not me.
- Uh, well,

223
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,199
- it's both of you. It's both of you.
- Uh...

224
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:10,811
I'm gonna give you one star, jerk!

225
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,684
Maybe consider getting
some gum for those pits!

226
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,337
What an ass... Hey, everybody.

227
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,818
Just coming back from a real quick trip.

228
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:18,993
We walked to the store

229
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:21,213
and then we took a
fantastic rideshare home.

230
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:23,391
And we got a really awesome
bag of ice to show for it.

231
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,197
- And stop!
- What? What are you doing?

232
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:26,261
Well, you don't want me to say "cut,"

233
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,611
- so I'll say "stop." It's better.
- Well, I wanted

234
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,177
to bring the ice up into the
frame so I could show them...

235
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,745
- and don't say, don't say "cut" or "stop," just stop.
- Oh, okay.

236
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:33,617
All right? Let's do it again.
Where is the ice?

237
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,619
- Uh, the ice is melted. Yeah, not much left.
- Uh...

238
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,273
- What?!
- It was super hot in that car, Dee.

239
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,492
Oh, Christ!

240
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,059
- Cat food, please?
- Not...

241
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,281
We're not gonna get the cat food
'cause we...

242
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,454
- I can't go back in there without d... Hey!
- And go!

243
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:46,804
We're just getting ice out here.

244
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,917
- And stop.
- Beating the heat.

245
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,155
Hey...

246
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,722
- fans.
- And stop!

247
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,202
I'm going to murder you.

248
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,639
- Whoa, you're freaking out.
- Yes.

249
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,380
I am freaking out.
Film when I say "film."

250
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,543
Hey, everybody.

251
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,600
- You said "film."
- All good. It's just hot.

252
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:03,168
It's just so hot. And cut.

253
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,649
- You saying "cut" now?
- I say "cut," not you!

254
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,303
- All right, I got a plan.
- It's hard to follow all your rules, Dee.

255
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,741
- Just shut up! We're gonna call a car.
- Uh-huh.

256
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,699
We're gonna get in the car.
We're gonna go get ice.

257
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,222
We're gonna come back with a bag of ice,

258
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,659
and we're gonna shove
it in their face...

259
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,269
So we're taking two cars when
we could've taken one car

260
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,531
or called the truck and this whole thing

261
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:19,967
could've been done, like, hours ago.

262
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,666
- Okay. We'll walk. But stop talking to me!
- Okay, we'll walk.

263
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,760
- And I'm rolling.
- Hi. We're just gonna walk to get some more ice.

264
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,734
_

265
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:45,993
Hey, Frank.

266
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:48,822
Global warming is the fucking best.

267
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,781
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

268
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,478
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Over here.

269
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,697
Ah.

270
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,220
- Yeah.
- All right, guys.

271
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:56,874
Listen, we got another problem,
all right?

272
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,789
We're running out of glasses
and I can't run the dishwasher

273
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,268
'cause it's too big of a power suck.

274
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,530
It's gonna kill the AC.

275
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:03,097
I got a fix. We got this stuff

276
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:05,665
back when we were gonna
have the Memorial Day party,

277
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,494
but then we had to cancel
it because of the blizzard.

278
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,496
- Oh! You bought the... yeah!
- Yeah!

279
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,324
- That's working together, baby.
- It's plastic.

280
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,718
- Nice work.
- The Lord provideth again!

281
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,807
No, Mac! No. The Lord not provideth.

282
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,809
Frank provideth.
He's the one who bought the cups.

283
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,853
Frank provideth.

284
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:22,682
That... well, the Lord
provideth the snowstorm in May

285
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,553
that allowed us to get the cups now.

286
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:27,687
- Uh-huh.
- See? It's all a part of his divine plan, Dennis.

287
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,733
And that's locked in, so we're good.

288
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,109
Okay, so all we have to do is nothing?

289
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,519
No. No, because, uh,
we have free will, Dennis,

290
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:36,130
which means that, um,
we have to take the necessary steps

291
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:38,785
to make sure that that
plan comes to fruition.

292
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,047
- Which is predetermined.
- Yes.

293
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,875
But it doesn't matter what we
do if it's all predetermined.

294
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,269
You see how your argument
doesn't make any sense?

295
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,706
Uh, that's correct.
But it doesn't have to make sense,

296
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,926
because that's where the faith comes in.

297
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:52,059
Right? I have faith that
what I'm saying makes sense.

298
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,931
Okay, so even if it doesn't make sense,

299
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,280
your faith makes it make sense.

300
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,108
- Correct.
- Got it. Okay, so there's no way

301
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,849
to have a rational
conversation with you.

302
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,851
- No.
- Climate change affects us all.

303
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,374
Okay? We're all in this together.
All right?

304
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,593
We need to work together,
and we can still make a profit, okay?

305
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,987
Don't worry. Just let me think
about how to make this work.

306
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,163
Well, think fast,
because it's getting hotter in here

307
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:10,774
and people are gonna start dying.

308
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,210
I got an idea. I got an idea.

309
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:13,994
Look, the-the music,
it's very, very up-tempo.

310
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:16,344
What if we throw a couple
slow jams in here, all right?

311
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,346
Drop the body heat down a notch.

312
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,913
- Let's do it.
- That's an excellent idea.

313
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:22,350
And don't you see how
God came through you

314
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,743
to come up with that idea?

315
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:25,571
Go turn... change the music.

316
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,791
- Change the music.
- I'll go change the music. I'm-a change the music.

317
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:29,793
Son of a bitch.

318
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:31,969
Charged me 20 extra bucks for this one.

319
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,579
- Want me to film this rant?
- No!

320
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:35,581
Obviously I don't. What is this?
What have you done?

321
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,583
Well, I got a nice little trash bag...
that's keeping me

322
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,585
a little bit cooler...
and then this totally creates shade.

323
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:40,760
You want me to make you a hat?

324
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:43,154
No, thanks. I don't want
to wear trash on my head.

325
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:44,764
You're wearing it on your feet.

326
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,592
I paid 90 bucks for these things.

327
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:47,828
Well, I can charge you for the hat if it

328
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:48,942
- makes you feel better.
- No, that's not the point

329
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,770
- I was making, but the...
- Oh, all right.

330
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:52,424
My shoes do suck. My feet are dead.

331
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:53,817
Let's just call another car and get back

332
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,776
to the bar before this ice melts again.

333
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,604
Oh, goddamn it.

334
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,432
- What's wrong?
- My account's been suspended.

335
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,826
That driver gave me one star,
citing "verbal abuse"

336
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,219
and saying I urinated all
over the backseat of his car.

337
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:07,004
That was melted ice.

338
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,049
Actually, I did pee
back there a little bit.

339
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:11,573
- I did, too. It was a very long ride.
- You did? I thought you did.

340
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:13,401
- I did. Yeah. But that's not the point.
- Ah, all right.

341
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,664
The point is we're stuck now.

342
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,884
Unless we take the bus.

343
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,500
Goddamn it.

344
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:31,424
_

345
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,074
How did it get hotter?

346
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,207
I don't know, man.
I think the slow jams backfired.

347
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,209
It's like all the friction
from the grinding,

348
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,950
like, created a closed system.

349
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,083
I didn't account for all
the increased sexiness.

350
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,693
There's a lot of rumblings coming from

351
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,521
- the water section, too, there.
- Well, that's 'cause

352
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,306
they're not reusing the cups.
You know what I mean?

353
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,047
They don't have any cups left.
They're throwing all the trash

354
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,049
- in the water.
- And they want more booze.

355
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:54,442
Which, by the way, we don't have any.

356
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,835
We didn't have enough
to accommodate the people

357
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,098
that were here before,
and now it seems like

358
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,971
we've doubled in size and
we just don't have enough.

359
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,886
- Where is your God now?
- Yeah, Mac.

360
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,279
- He will reveal himself at some point.
- Oh.

361
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:08,326
Well, is he gonna do it
before all these people revolt

362
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,110
- and destroy the place?
- All right...

363
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,720
I don't know, Frank.
I don't question God's will.

364
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:13,113
If he wants to destroy the Earth,
that's on him.

365
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,462
- I support it!
- What are you talking about?

366
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:15,986
Guys-guys, stop... Okay, stop bickering.

367
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,291
We can't be bickering. Okay, look.

368
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,206
We said we were gonna
beat the heat together.

369
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,555
As a team, as a community.

370
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,905
And that's what we're gonna do,
goddamn it.

371
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,863
I got it. I got it.

372
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:24,995
Hey, uh, everybody,
if I could get your attention, please.

373
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,213
I got a quick announcement.

374
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:28,041
If everybody could just
listen up real quick.

375
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,782
- Dennis has an announcement.
- Yeah, I have an annou...

376
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,131
You don't need to
announce my announcement.

377
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,350
Okay.

378
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,743
Idiot. Um, okay, uh, so, guys,

379
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:36,310
uh, are you guys having a good time?

380
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:37,806
What a great party, huh?

381
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,099
That's right, that's right.
But check this out.

382
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:43,709
Check this out. Here's my announcement.

383
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:46,059
We do need to chill out
on the dancing a little bit,

384
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,105
'cause we-we're overworking
that AC, but...

385
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:50,455
Now, now, no, no, I get it,

386
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,978
I get it, I get it, I get it.

387
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,153
Listen, you think I want to be that guy?

388
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:55,721
I don't want to be that guy,
but I think if we just

389
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:58,115
stop dancing for just a second,
the AC can catch up,

390
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,943
this place can cool down.

391
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,031
I don't want to stop.

392
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,554
You don't want to stop? Yeah, I know.

393
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:03,947
Nobody wants to stop.

394
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,905
We're all having a good time.
But maybe we just, like...

395
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,167
Uh, you know what? Let's not stop.

396
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,039
Let's not stop at all.
Let's just chill out.

397
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,954
We'll chill out for a second,
you know what I mean?

398
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,564
We'll chill out. We'll slow things down.

399
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,740
- I don't want to slow down.
- Okay, listen,

400
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,176
I know you don't want
to slow down, I get it.

401
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,612
Nobody wants to slow down.

402
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,701
It's all good,
but we got to work together, right?

403
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:22,095
We got to, we got to work
together to keep this place cool

404
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,749
and to keep everything kosher,
all right?

405
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,620
One other announcement:
uh, we're running a little low

406
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,361
on tequila and other liquors.

407
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:30,538
All right, so...

408
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:32,149
I'm not talking crazy stuff here.

409
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,064
We got plenty to go around, all right?

410
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,153
Maybe instead of ten shots,
we do, like, five or six.

411
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,371
That's it. You know?

412
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,330
I... I-I want ten shots.

413
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:40,984
You want ten shots, but, you know,

414
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:43,595
ten shots is too much for you
and five to six is plenty.

415
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:44,701
Don't tell her what she needs.

416
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:48,078
Stop. Everybody st... O-Okay.
I get it. Look, l-let's not...

417
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,862
You're losing them, you're losing them!

418
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:52,125
All right, look, I'm not trying
to bring the mood down, guys.

419
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,562
This is... It's all good. Okay?
Just... let's just recognize

420
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,390
that just... whoa, pal.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

421
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,435
Okay, look, stop.

422
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,482
I'm just saying we're in
a little bit of a tricky situation here.

423
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,134
We can figure this out.

424
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,136
Just, it's getting real hot in here.

425
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,182
Okay? And we're running
a little low on resources.

426
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,659
It's fine. W-We... But if we adapt,
we'll keep the party going

427
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,058
for a long, long time. So who's with me?

428
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:28,327
I got the booze!

429
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,658
Oh, my God. That bus was hot as shit.

430
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,009
- The third bus was the hottest, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

431
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:52,011
It's those local buses.
We should've just gotten off

432
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,100
- at the express and walked, but that's...
- It's all the buses.

433
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:55,232
- They're bad.
- Whoo.

434
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,885
- Please tell me the ice didn't melt.
- Uh, no,

435
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,062
but somebody ripped a hole in the bag

436
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:00,280
- and stole it. Yeah.
- What?!

437
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,108
- How did you not notice that?
- Oh, I don't know.

438
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:04,415
My back must have gone numb
from the ice on my back.

439
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,286
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, no. No. I can't go all the way

440
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,088
- back to that store. I can't do it.
- Oh, no.

441
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,202
No, that's too many vehicles.

442
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:11,204
But how are your feet feeling, though?

443
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:12,640
Oh, I got to say, though,

444
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:14,294
Charlie, the feet are feeling real good.

445
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,904
- Whatever you made...
- I'm pretty proud of that shoe.

446
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:18,255
- Uh, you should be.
- Yeah. That's the medical sponge, which is...

447
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,300
- I don't want to hear any of the details, though.
- Oh, okay.

448
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:21,432
- I'll spare you.
- Okay? Thank you.

449
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:23,086
Whoo. So what's the plan now?

450
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,088
I got one last idea.

451
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:30,528
Hey, oh! Ice!

452
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,312
We got ice.

453
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,140
What's going on in here?
Who are these guys?

454
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:35,315
Uh, these are our friends

455
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,882
from the fish factory. What's up, guys?

456
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,449
They're actually pretty good
dudes once you get to know them.

457
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,386
Yeah, nice c... not like the
people we had in here before.

458
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:43,215
- They were terrible.
- Uh, well, what happened to the party, though?

459
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:45,294
People were animals, just like I said.

460
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,740
All right, well,
while you guys were in here

461
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,742
destroying the environment, I got ice,

462
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:50,744
with barely a carbon footprint.

463
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:52,964
And I also made a
pretty sweet Insta Story

464
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:56,035
to spread the word and
shame my followers.

465
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,708
- Mm-hmm.
- Check it out.

466
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,231
What up, Dee's Nuts?

467
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:01,625
Just another important
Insta message for you.

468
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,844
Don't forget to reduce, reuse and...

469
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,150
I'd rather drive six Hummers

470
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:07,195
than smell your shit breath, loser!

471
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,849
Well, these shoes suck.
They're terrible.

472
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,634
My feet are all blistered.
What are you doing? Don't...

473
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:12,810
- You're the stupid idiot! Okay?
- No. You put my ice bag down...

474
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:14,855
I'm not putting the ice down!
I'm taking the ice!

475
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,640
- I'll give your money this time.
- Get the hell out of my store.

476
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,859
But you try and gouge me again,
you son of a bitch,

477
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,078
I'll gouge your eyes out!

478
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,296
There you go.

479
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,646
Last time you get recycled.

480
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,822
Hope a bird chokes to death on you.

481
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,651
I hate the bus!
Oh, you're disgusting!

482
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:30,218
I can't stand being near
you low-life degenerates!

483
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,615
Ah. Yeah. Not tipping you either,
so don't even ask.

484
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,704
- And cut.
- Okay, stop saying "and cut."

485
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,709
Goddamn it, Charlie.

486
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,222
