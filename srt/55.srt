1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,838
[Mac] So, how many restraining orders
does the waitress have on you?

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,799
[Charlie] A lot, dude.
She's been irritated with me.

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,093
"You got me fired from the
Oldies Rock Café. Guys.

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,304
You're gonna get me fired from the coffee shop.
" This is incredible.

5
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:17,308
Listen to this message. Come here.
This chick is so in love with me, it's crazy.

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,310
[On Phone]
Hi, Dennis, it's Caylee.

7
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,522
I was just calling to let you
know that I hope you die!

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,525
You are obviously a terrible person
with no regard for anyone but yourself!

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,028
I never, ever want to see you again,
you steaming pile of horseshit!

10
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,197
Go to hell!
[Laughs]

11
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:35,118
Whoa, that's amazing. That's the best one yet.
Yeah, it's a really good one.

12
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,661
What?
She hates your guts.

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,330
Dee, this chick is so in love with
me, she doesn't even know it.

14
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,541
They don't get it because you
haven't explained it to them, bro.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,210
Oh, guys, I have a system,
a foolproof system...

16
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,172
for getting any chick's undying
love and devotion for life.

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,757
What the hell are you
talking about, dude?

18
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm talking about
the D.E.N.N.I.S. System.

19
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,337
Ladies and gentlemen,
the D.E.N.N.I.S. System...

20
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,425
is a comprehensive approach to seduction
that I have perfected over the years.

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,596
See, my success with women does not solely
stem from my good looks and my charm.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,599
There is a careful,
systemic approach...

23
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,560
that has allowed me to become
the playboy that I am today.

24
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,730
- A playboy?
Is that how you see yourself? - Yes.

25
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,025
He has banged a lot of chicks.
Just shut up, Dee. Shut up.

26
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,405
Now, the first step to any erotic conquest
is to "D"- demonstrate your value.

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,701
In this most recent case my subject
was Caylee, a cute pharmacist.

28
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,079
[Dennis] I demonstrated my value
to her by filling a prescription.

29
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,041
I told her, "It's for my grandmother.
She's quite ill."

30
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:10,338
Thus demonstrating my value as a loving
grandson and an all-around great guy.

31
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,299
- You're forging prescriptions now?
- That's the easy part, Dee.

32
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,844
I would've gone in and bought
a box of magnum condoms,

33
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,097
thus demonstrating that
I have a monster dong.

34
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,391
Right. That comes of
a little bit desperate, Frank.

35
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:26,771
Now, if you want to have a magnum condom
peeking out of your wallet when you go to pay,

36
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,564
that's a different story.

37
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,942
- [Frank] Oh, yeah.
- Now let's move on.

38
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:35,112
Once you've demonstrated your value,
you are going to want to ask her out.

39
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:39,158
Once you've asked her out,
you move on to "E."

40
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,160
"Engage physically."

41
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,163
I personally try to engage the girl
physically without ever going on the date,

42
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,624
which to me is really
just a waste of time and money.

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,961
[Dennis] I'll tell her I know this great little
restaurant that doesn't take reservations.

44
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,963
That makes it sound cool,
makes it sound exclusive.

45
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,465
And then when we get to the
restaurant, the restaurant is closed,

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,218
as, of course,
it always is on Sundays.

47
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,263
So I'll feign surprise and say
something along the lines of,

48
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,350
"I guess we could grab a pizza
and watch a movie at my place."

49
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,353
That's where I come in.
Oh, you're a part of this?

50
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,314
Oh, yeah. Mac has a very
special place in my system.

51
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,651
Yeah. You see, I'm on the couch when
they come in and ask to be alone.

52
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,696
- Then I say- - I can't go in my room.
I found a black widow spider in there.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,533
Dennis fires back that he wants some privacy so
that they can get to know each other better.

54
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,620
- [Dennis] And then I say- - Oh.
Well, I guess we could eat the pizza on my bed...

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,706
and watch the DVD in my room.

56
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,711
And once we're on my bed,
it is game over.

57
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,298
I engage her physically
and the sexual waltz begins.

58
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,801
Pizza's good.
You're the one that's good.

59
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,686
Smooth! Very- Very smooth stuff.
Very classy.

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,063
I'm learning a lot from
you right now, dude.

61
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,277
Okay. Now, once you've had sex with a woman, she
will naturally start to depend on you. Okay?

62
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,905
All women do this.

63
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,157
They certainly do.
You got that right. [Laughing]

64
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,825
Sex with women!

65
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,827
Once you bang 'em,
you know- Like that.

66
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,537
Right. Right.

67
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,916
Which brings me
to the first "N."

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,918
"Nurturing Dependence."

69
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,922
You're gonna want to nurture that dependence
that she's feeling on you now, guys.

70
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,090
Have her car towed.

71
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,092
Or you can slash her tires.

72
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,887
Either way, make her
depend on you for rides.

73
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,889
Or you can use
my personal go-to,

74
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,892
which is to create a fictional, angry
neighbor who is threatening her...

75
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,144
and tell her
you'll take care of him.

76
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,773
[Dennis] Hit up a pay phone so that she
can't trace the calls back to you.

77
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,108
Give her a call and say
something along the lines of...

78
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,446
[Sinister Voice] I'm watching you, you bitch.
You're gonna die tonight!

79
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,491
[Sobbing]

80
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,787
Oh, for Christ's sake!
You're a complete sociopath!

81
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,956
Don't interrupt. Okay?

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,500
Now, if you've completed all the other
steps properly up to this point,

83
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,752
she'll naturally want to take the
relationship to the next level.

84
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,879
But you're not gonna do that.
You're gonna do the exact opposite.

85
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,091
Pull back, guys. Pull back.

86
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,886
Which brings me to the second
"N," "Neglect Emotionally."

87
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,763
You stop
taking her phone calls.

88
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,640
Cancel all your plans.

89
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,893
Maybe that fictional, angry neighbor
that you've simulated comes back,

90
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,896
and this time you're not around
to cool him off.

91
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,607
[Rings] Hello?

92

[Sinister Laughing]

94
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,200
[Sinister Laughing]

95
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,286
This will frighten
the shit out of her.

96
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,623
Okay? And she'll start getting really mixed
up because you're not there to protect her.

97
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,667
She'll start questioning
her self-worth,

98
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,919
start questioning her-
her self-esteem.

99
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,296
And that's the perfect time
to "I"...

100
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,591
"Inspire Hope."

101
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,261
In Caylee's case, I went to
her window and I screamed...

102
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,472
Caylee, listen.
Listen. Wait.

103
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,892
I want to tell you that the reason
I was distant is because...

104
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,146
I was afraid that you were
gonna break my heart...

105
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,523
and I got scared.

106
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,694
But I'm not scared
anymore, baby.

107
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,156
I love you. I need you.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,075
And then, naturally, we bang.

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,092
♪ Watchin' every motion
in my foolish lover's gaze ♪♪.

111
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,554
And this is the best bang of all
because it's very emotional for her.

112
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,390
You see, she thinks she's broken
through my tough exterior...

113
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:35,561
and coerced affection from a
man who is afraid to love.

114
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,190
And then I slink out
into the night,

115
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,734
never to talk to her again.

116
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,323

The D.E.N.N.I.S. System.

122

That, my friends, is the key
to winning any girl's heart.

123

Yeah! All right!
Good stuff.

124
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,720
Better than I remember it.
Oh, good!

125
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,223
Are you kidding me?
You are not winning their hearts.

126
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,433
You're torturing them
and they end up hating you.

127
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,394
Actually, Dee, they end up loving me more
than they ever thought was possible.

128
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,064
And you set it up so you can get
these chicks back at any time?

129
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,651
That's exactly right, Charlie.
You're really picking up on this. I'm proud of you, bud.

130
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,113
There is no way that girl is gonna come back
to you after what you just put her through.

131
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,117
I could absolutely get that girl back
anytime I want. I just choose not to.

I 100% guarantee you
this girl's finished with you.

Dee, and I accept that challenge.

00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,727
That will provide the perfect setting
for all of our needs to be met.

290
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,105
You will demonstrate your value to the
waitress by winning a prize at her booth.

291
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,108
Good, dude! Then I give her
the prize and that's good!

292
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,860
No, that's dead wrong actually.

293
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,155
You're gonna take the prize and award it
to the bustiest woman you can find. Okay?

294
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,450
Your indifference to the waitress will
only make you more attractive to her.

295
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:56,330
Now, Dee, because of your ridiculous
missteps, you actually have no value.

296
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,124
Mm-hmm. So your only hope
is to lower Ben's value.

297
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,127
You're gonna do this by flirting
with a carney in front of him.

298
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,755
Oh, gosh, yeah, I don't know if
I want to deal with a carney.

299
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,425
No one likes dealing with carneys, and
that's why Frank will pose as one.

300
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,094
Now, Mac, you're
the final piece in this puzzle.

301
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:16,350
I need you to resume your role as the thoughtful
roommate and invite Caylee out to the fair.

302
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,728
There I shall be waiting
to win back her heart.

303
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,483
- How you gonna do that?
- I gotta get myself a grandmother.

304
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,035
What's happening?

305
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,537
What's happening is,
we're at the fair, Gladys,

306
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,665
and you're gonna act
like my grandma, okay?

307
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,960
My grandmother had an affair
with Susan B. Anthony.

308
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,089
I-I don't give a shit.
I'm paying you not to talk.

309
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,300
Well, hello!
This is a coincidence, huh?

310
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,595
No, it's not. No, it's not.
But it's exciting, isn't it?

311
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,682
So, what game do we have here?
What game is this?

312
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,520
Speed Pitch. That's all you do?
You throw a pitch?

313
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,230
I mean, what prizes are there?

314
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,190
There are no prizes, Charlie.

315
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,567
It's just to see "how
fast can you throw." Oh!

316
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:12,155
Then I guess I'll demonstrate my value to you
by firing off a wicked hot fastball, huh?

317
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,200
[Chuckles] You know this
game is for children, right?

318
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,912
I don't care that it's for kids. All right?
Let me demonstrate my value to you. Please!

319
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,082
When I was little, all the kids would
beat me up and call me Bookworm.

320
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,960
- Right this way, Nana.
- Kids are so brutal.

321
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,462
Oh. Hi, Mac, Caylee.
I didn't see you there.

322
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,965
- What are you doing here?
- This is my nana.

323
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,467
She's on the mend, so I wanted
to get her out of the house.

324
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:37,139
- This is your grandmother? - Oh, yeah. Yeah.
This is Nana. Yeah. Isn't she precious?

325
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,600
My grandmother was a lesbian.

326
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,607
Well?
How does it look?

327
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,901
It's great.
You look like a lizard.

Okay.

I'm breaking her down.
I'm making her feel worthless. You see?

She thinks she's got the H.
