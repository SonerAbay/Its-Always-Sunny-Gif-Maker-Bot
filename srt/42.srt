1
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:18,247
What the shit is this?

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,930
Uh, Cheech over here
bought himself a bong.

3
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,619
Deandra, this is wacky.

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,382
Go download me
a hoagie off the Internet.

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,319
I'm sorry?

6
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:31,261
Those words don't make any
s- sense.

7
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:34,378
Oh, God, you guys.
Oh, weird, I feel weird.

8
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,767
- Rip another one.
- Yeah, say something else stupid, too.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,544
My arm's kind of numb.
Dennis, can you feel my head? Am I hot?

10
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:42,408
- I'm not touching you.
- We're enjoying ourselves over here.

11
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,152
I'm serious, you guys.
Something's not right.

12
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:46,394
- There's pigeons in the bar.
- I feel...

13
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:47,495
Pigeons in the bar.

14
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,968
I'm being really serious,
you guys, I need some he...

15
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,250
Good one.

16
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:53,926
- What is her problem?
- I don't know.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,778
Synchro : Criztian and Sososeries

18
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:29,013
- So... heart attack.
- Yeah, yikes.

19
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:30,859
Yeah, that's what I was
trying to say.

20
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:33,202
And the EMT says basically
I'm like a ticking time bomb

21
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,678
at this point 'cause
it was just a little one.

22
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,287
I didn't know women could
have heart attacks.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,732
You know, what's scary about
this whole thing, really, is

24
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,718
that I have the same genes as her.

25
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:41,690
I'm concerned for
myself and Charlie as well.

26
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,439
We lead a very
rock-and-roll lifestyle.

27
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:44,059
I know.

28
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,694
I just had a heart attack. Can we
focus on me for two minutes here?

29
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,576
- I feel like we did talk about you.
- Dee, your ship has sailed.

30
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,022
Okay, it's time to move on to us,
the people who are going to live on.

31
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:54,049
Guys, we got to make sure that
this does not happen to us.

32
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:56,388
That's the important thing here.
We need to focus on ourselves...

33
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,368
- Ms. Reynolds?
- Doctor, thank God. Listen,

34
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,276
let's just do all the
tests you've got, okay?

35
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,056
I feel like the big one's right
around the corner.

36
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:04,761
Well, actually, Ms. Reynolds,
first we need to discuss

37
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,186
how you'll be paying for your stay.

38
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,104
Paying?
This is a hospital.

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,975
- Since when do you pay to stay in a hospital?
- Since always.

40
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,153
Uh, no, I believe that is
what taxes are for.

41
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,073
Yeah, you don't pay a fireman
to put out a fire.

42
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:18,468
Or a cop to shoot a guy or...

43
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,755
How do you not know how this works?
You've been in a hospital before.

44
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,869
I guess I must have slipped
through the cracks.

45
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:25,832
I do always give a fake name
'cause I like to stay off the grid.

46
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,621
They usually just give me a
bunch of antibiotics,

47
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,552
- the sores go away, and I walk out.
- Shut up.

48
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,723
- Doctor, I have health insurance.
- Yeah, we're on our father's policy.

49
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,120
You guys, check out this cool gown.

50
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,625
Really lets your ass breathe.

51
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:40,947
- Oh, my God.
- Son of a bitch.

52
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,296
Why are you wearing that
thing, dude?

53
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,549
I'm getting a full-body scan.
I've been partying real hard lately.

54
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,739
Whatever. She needs to
see the insurance card.

55
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,086
I canceled that shit when you
were nine.

56
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,625
- You canceled our insurance policy?
- What?

57
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,760
What, am I gonna carry that
burden around?

58
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:57,210
You couldn't have given us a
heads-up about that a long time ago?

59
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:58,849
Okay, let me get this
straight.

60
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:02,533
Ms. Reynolds, you have no health
insurance?

61
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,806
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

62
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,745
Well, get out.

63
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,517
Harsh.

64
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:18,907
Why is the government not
providing us with health insurance?

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,533
I mean, what is this, like some
kind of socialist country

66
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,683
or some kind of communist
dictatorship? This is insane,

67
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:28,521
this is un American. You don't pay
for health insurance. That's crazy.

68
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,572
All I know is we need to find
insurance ASAP.

69
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,029
Oh, my God, we're going to
get sick eventually.

70
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,519
So we just find a couple of
side jobs, right?

71
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:37,176
That way we'll have insurance, and when
disaster inevitably occurs, we'll be covered.

72
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,151
- We'll be covered.
- Okay, here we go.

73
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,952
"Position available.
Major sales corporation.

74
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:44,346
Motivated individuals.
Good interpersonal skills".

75
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,782
You don't have to say anymore.
That's us, that is us.

76
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,823
"Salary and benefits".

77
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:50,463
Jesus.

78
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,234
Why are you still wearing
that thing, dude?

79
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,823
- Did you wear that all the way here?
- I let my ass breathe.

80
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,596
You keep saying that, but I
don't know what it means.

81
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,309
Yeah, how does an ass breathe?
Explain that to me.

82
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:01,753
- How does a...?
- Just leave me alone, okay?!

83
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,780
I can't get worked up.
My doctor told me not to get worked up.

84
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,916
I'm under too much stress.

85
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,328
Yeah...

86
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:09,921
That's a lot of pills, dude.

87
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:11,960
Yeah, that's the beauty of
having insurance.

88
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:15,569
You can get the top-quality
anti-anxiety drugs.

89
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:17,841
Wow, you got a lot of 'em, huh?

90
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:20,673
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking 'em because

91
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,694
I can't sift through the duds.

92
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:25,980
I got to take 'em all because I
got to get healthy really fast.

93
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,256
- You're taking 'em all at once?
- Yeah.

94
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,743
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- It seems a bit aggressive to me.

95
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,565
I know what I'm doing!

96
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,059
Oh, this is great, Dee.
This is perfect.

97
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,574
I mean, getting in shape is like the
best health insurance you can get.

98
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:40,096
Yeah, you take care of your body,
you don't need a doctor. I want that.

99
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,132
That's exactly right, yeah.
You look good, you feel good.

100
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,116
- It's all connected, baby.
- It's connected. You're talking about

101
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,615
the mind- body-abs connection.
I would personally like to

102
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,737
- get some side abs going.
- You want to get some side abs?

103
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,422
That's a good idea. You know
what I'm concerned about?

104
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:51,757
- I don't want to get too bulky.
- Right.

105
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,266
I want to stay nice and lean
and tight.

106
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,574
I want to get that
Jesus-on-the-cross look.

107
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:58,878
I think that crucifixion must have been
really good for your core because...

108
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,321
Absolutely. Jesus had, like,
the best abs. He had the right idea.

109
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,883
- Hey, he knew: no pain, no gain.
- He had good messages.

110
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,074
I'm sure he started that.

111
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,864
All right, well, let's do
some cardio since we're here.

112
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:09,287
Yeah, here we are.
Let's, uh, let's get our blood pumping.

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,153
Let's hop on these treadmills and,
uh, you know, let's do this thing.

114
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,754
- Let's do it.
- All right.

115
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,956
- I don't know if I'm ready.
- I'm not feeling ready.

116
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,474
Uh, I'll tell you why.
I feel a little low-energy.

117
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,252
That's what it is.
We need to fuel up.

118
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:24,107
Now, I see people utilizing a lot
of shakes and powders around here.

119
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,727
- We should probably look into that.
- We should do that.

120
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,786
You know what else we should do?
Get some new outfits.

121
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,909
Let's get some new outfits.
That's a great idea.

122
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,313
You decided to rock jeans,
for instance. I'm confused by that.

123
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:35,602
Yeah, uh, I chose jeans. I'm not
seeing a lot of other jeans...

124
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:38,326
- I've never seen jeans in a gym.
- Okay, well, look, that's fine.

125
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,856
This is what we'll do.
We'll dial it back.

126
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,065
We'll get fueled up, we'll get
some sick new outfits,

127
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:43,514
and then we'll come back
and work out.

128
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,167
Let's go.

129
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,415
"Official résumé***
of Mac and Charlie".

130
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:50,358
So both of you are...

131
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:54,100
Well, gentlemen, I've never seen
two people share a resume before.

132
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:57,058
Well, we thought we'd save paper.
You know, go green.

133
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:00,832
Uh, "Work experience: Paddy's
Pub management"?

134
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,436
And duties that include

135
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:05,023
"ordering supplies
and taking care of business".

136
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:06,525
T.C.O.B.

137
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:10,086
Uh, "Business coordinator for several
year"-- I don't know who this is.

138
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,334
- Coordinator.
- Okay.

139
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:15,472
"For several years, I've been in complete
charge of pretty much everything in my life."

140
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,232
- I don't miss a beat.
- That would actually be him.

141
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:19,487
Uh, not-- pretty much
everything.

142
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,466
There's certain things that you
just can't have control of, sir.

143
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,360
I think you'll find that what
we lack in formal education,

144
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,608
we more than make up
for in street smarts.

145
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,014
Okay, so we can wheel, we can deal,
we can oversee hostile takeovers.

146
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:32,314
- Whatever you need, bud.
- You name it.

147
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:36,243
It's a mailroom gig, and
there's only one spot available.

148
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,120
Kind of a package deal.

149
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,855
We sort of work as a team.
I'll tell you what.

150
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,755
What if we split the pay right
down the middle?

151
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,266
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,023
Yeah, this has nothing to do
with money.

153
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:50,850
This is sort of a health
insurance situation for us...

154
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:53,398
...so, you know, frankly, you don't
even really have to pay us at all.

155
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:56,655
Legally, I have to pay you
something, but, uh,

156
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:59,119
- minimum wage maybe?
- Minimum wage?

157
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,202
Are you kidding me?

158
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:01,711
- That's great.
- Absolutely.

159
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,960
That's a government salary
right there, yeah.

160
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:07,259
Well, you drive a hard bargain.
The job is both of yours.

161
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,600
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you.

162
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,540
- Bro.
- Minimum wage.

163
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,206
Minimum wage.

164
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,808
Fat burner?

165
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,099
Well, I'm already on a
nitric oxide energy stack,

166
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,661
but yeah, sure, I'll take some fat
burner-- why not?

167
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:27,631
All right, everybody.
Before we begin today,

168
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,861
are there any physical ailments
that I should know about first?

169
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:33,895
- Uh, yeah, I just had a heart attack.
- Excuse me?

170
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:36,787
I just had a heart attack. Maybe you
should turn this techno music down.

171
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,539
Yeah, I got to be honest, buddy,
I'm not really feeling these tunes.

172
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:43,230
- Boom, there we go.
- Hey, what are you doing?

173
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:46,703
I'm rifling through your music,
and it's pretty terrible.

174
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,781
- Yeah, you know what, put it down.
- Does he have any '80s?

175
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,490
Doesn't appear to.

176
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,485
No, it seems like he's got a
bunch of goddamn dance mixes.

177
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,773
Hang on. It's all good.

178
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,335
I got a Steve Winwood CD in my car.
I'll just go out and grab that.

179
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,293
Okay, listen, don't do that.
Please don't do that.

180
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,352
- Why, what's wrong with Steve Winwood?
- Yeah, man,

181
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,620
"Higher Love"?
It's a classic.

182
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,049
Listen, I pick the music in
this class, okay?

183
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:07,714
Oh, no, no, no.
I apologize.

184
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:09,994
I had no idea that this was all
about you.

185
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:12,635
First of all, I don't think you should even
be here if you just had a heart attack, ma'am.

186
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,387
Well, maybe you shouldn't
dress like a bumblebee, bitch.

187
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,264
You just dogged, bro.

188
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:19,456
You just got dogged.

189
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,291
Guys, please leave my class.

190
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:23,570
Spin class.

191
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:24,991
A bunch of hamsters
on a wheel.

192
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:26,869
I'm gonna ride a bike hard,
I'm gonna ride a bike fast

193
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,677
and oh, yeah, I'm not
gonna go anywhere.

194
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,349
And then when I walk
out, I'm gonna put a bunch of metal

195
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:33,402
onto a metal bar and lift that metal
over and over like a metal jerk.

196
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:34,529
You know, I got
to be honest with you.

197
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,534
I feel like these supplements
are doing a great job on their own,

198
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,194
you know what I mean?

199
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:38,422
I've got tons of energy.

200
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,338
My heart rate's up.
Things are going great.

201
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:41,616
Absolutely.
I feel good, too.

202
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:44,304
Look how vascular I am.
Look at how my veins are popping.

203
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,748
I look good,
and I feel good.

204
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,648
I feel good, too, apart from the recent
bouts of explosive diarrhea.

205
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,529
Been having diarrhea?

206
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:52,392
- Oh, God, all over the place.
- Really?

207
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:53,169
You know what that is?

208
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,794
That's probably your body
flushing out all the toxins.

209
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:56,117
- You think so?
- I do think so.

210
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,588
I, on the other hand,
have not taken a shit in days.

211
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,723
- Days?
- Days.

212
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,527
- That doesn't sound good.
- Oh, no, it's good.

213
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,735
My body's working at 100%
efficiency, yeah.

214
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:05,742
My body is absorbing
every single nutrient,

215
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,213
and it's not wasting
a single thing.

216
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,496
Your body's taking
its job very seriously.

217
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:10,757
My body is doing its job like
it's never done before.

218
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,946
Okay, we're gonna start
climbing just a little more.

219
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,720
30% more resistance.

220
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,018
Why don't we up the
supplements, which we know work,

221
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,768
and eliminate working out,
which we know blows?

222
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,095
That sounds like
a pretty good plan.

223
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:22,596
You know what, I'm gonna take it
one step further and propose

224
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,404
that we start working on a
muscle that we've been

225
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:25,778
neglecting this entire time.

226
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:28,032
And it's the most important
muscle in the entire body.

227
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,019
Which muscle?

228
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,076
The face.

229
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,140
That's a gift for you,
bumblebee.

230
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,873
- Come on.
- Enjoy it, Coach Dick and Balls.

231
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,673
Mr. Taylor whose
grandpa was a sailor.

232
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,092
There you go, Mr. Scott
who drinks his coffee hot.

233
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:51,820
There it is.

234
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:54,919
Mr. White whose wife is not
too bright, there you go.

235
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,620
Come on, dude, I'm trying to
network by the water cooler.

236
00:09:57,703 --> 00:10:00,016
Yeah, and I'm doing both of our
jobs here, so you want to help out?

237
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,608
Okay, the mail doesn't stop
down there, Mac.

238
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:02,360
I need help.

239
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:03,898
All right, this is Felix's pile.

240
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,730
He receives for Eric.
He receives for Janet.

241
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,559
Don't ever look Janet in the eye
because she's a horrible devil woman.

242
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,685
I feel like you are taking
this shit way too seriously.

243
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:13,341
Will you just help me out, man?
This is Johnson's mail, okay?

244
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,901
Now, Johnson's gone AWOL for the
week with the wife and kids down

245
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,096
in Orlando, so I want you to
keep a pile in a neat stack

246
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,725
somewhere that's
all Johnson's mail.

247
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:21,016
Oh, wait a second.

248
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,579
This guy's in Orlando
for the week?

249
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,210
Yeah, man, come on,
help me out here.

250
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:25,936
Oh, hold on a second, bro.

251
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,028
This is the perfect opportunity.

252
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,586
I'm gonna hang out in his office
and pretend I'm the new guy.

253
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,922
I don't think that's
gonna work, dude.

254
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,341
Have you seen The Secret
of My Success?

255
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,343
They're gonna catch on to you.

256
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,886
Yeah, but before they do,
I will come up with an idea

257
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:41,640
that will save the company millions,
and they'll be forced to promote me.

258
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,476
Are you sure?
How does that movie end, dude?

259
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:48,501
I can't rember.

260
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:52,343
He bangs that old lady, and
then they play that song from the '80s.

261
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,443
"Day Bow Bow."

262
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,194
What the hell is "Day Bow Bow"?

263
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,590
No, Mac, seriously...

264
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,034
Beautiful.

265
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:19,511
At least give him his mail.

266
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,580
Jesus Christ, dude,
what's going on in here?

267
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,529
I'm really behind the
eight ball, Mac.

268
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:46,750
The mail doesn't stop, bud.

269
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,776
- You're smoking now?
- Yeah, I'm smoking now.

270
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:50,844
You kidding me?
My nerves are like...

271
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:51,603
So I'm trying to smoke.

272
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:53,575
I'm trying to calm myself down,
and hey, we got insurance,

273
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:54,925
so what the hell, I can smoke.

274
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:57,215
Maybe you're right 'cause I need
to calm my nerves a bit, dude.

275
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,460
It's a shark tank up there.

276
00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,786
Oh, yeah, is it?
I bet.

277
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,040
Have some coffee, too.
That will calm you down.

278
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:04,447
What's your system here, bro?

279
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,598
It's pretty complicated.

280
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,383
The mail goes into three
sections according

281
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,156
to how important I think
the thing looks, okay?

282
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,504
Now, the least important stuff,
I'm gonna burn that.

283
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:13,159
If it's important, they're
gonna send it again, right?

284
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,401
The middle important stuff,
I put that back in the mail

285
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,527
addressed to me so I buy
myself a couple more days.

286
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,482
And the most important stuff,
that gets delivered, although,

287
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,991
you know something, Mac, I actually
burn that, too, most of the time.

288
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,529
Okay, well, it looks like
you've got this under control.

289
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:28,911
I'm gonna get back to my office.

290
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:30,477
- All right, bud, all right.
- Yeah, no, I'm just... I'm...

291
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,179
- The mail doesn't stop!
- Okay, sorry, buddy.

292
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:34,434
All right, I'm gonna get back to
my office, and then...

293
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:35,455
You know, I'll see you later.

294
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:36,348
All right, man.

295
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:37,710
Okay, bud.

296
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:39,174
You're not gonna stop, are you?

297
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,761
Come on, man, hit me.

298
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,849
Come on, hit me again.
Come on.

299
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,072
Look.

300
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:51,416
I found him wandering
the streets.

301
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,330
No ID, no nothing.

302
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,502
Figure we turn him over to you
until someone claimed him.

303
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,104
- Poor thing.
- Careful.

304
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,520
I think he crapped himself.

305
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:02,550
This way.

306
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,338
Right through here.

307
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,528
Hit me, hit me again.

308
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,623
Hit me.

309
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:26,235
Hello?

310
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:28,372
Hi.

311
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,016
<i>Who is this?</i>

312
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,185
This is Mac.
I'm the new guy.

313
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,345
<i>What are you doing in my
office?</i>

314
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,488
<i>Who are you, and why
are you in my office?</i>

315
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:40,673
Who is this?

316
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:42,320
<i>This is Johnson.</i>

317
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,861
I thought you were in Orlando.

318
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,754
<i>I am in Orlando. I'm trying
to check my voicemail.</i>

319
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,190
I can check it for you.

320
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:55,491
<i>No, don't... just...
What is your name, sir?</i>

321
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:00,794
Why don't you just
give me your name?

322
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:02,826
Your full name, sir.

323
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,475
Oh, this is going to be
great, sis.

324
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,737
I mean, we already got the mind,
body and soul going.

325
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,792
Now all we need is to get
our faces nice and tight,

326
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,193
and we'll be healthy as all hell.

327
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,073
I know.

328
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:22,393
Now, you're clear on
these instructions, right?

329
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:23,732
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

330
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:25,348
You know what you're doing?
They're in Spanish.

331
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,951
Yeah, but you know, if you know Latin,
you know, like, three languages, so...

332
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,289
As far as I know,
you don't speak Latin.

333
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,456
I don't speak Latin, but there's
pictures in here, so I think we're good.

334
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,807
So you're good with
the pictures then?

335
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,017
Can we get going with this,
though?

336
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,672
'Cause those supplements are giving me
the squirts like you would not believe.

337
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,243
Oh, man, I would kill for
your bowel movements right now.

338
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,394
I am so blocked up.

339
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:43,474
I'm gonna do your eyes first,

340
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:44,674
- so hold really still.
- Easy, easy.

341
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:46,328
Seriously, do not move.

342
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,691
- It's in?
- It's out.

343
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:51,952
- It's out?
- I did it.

344
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,334
- It's out, and it's in.
- Pretty good, right?

345
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:53,808
Painless.

346
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,304
Great. Let's just let that
settle for a minute, and I'll...

347
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:57,915
Think about what
I would like to do.

348
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,827
Number one, I'd like to get rid
of these crow's feet that I have

349
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,734
been noticing coming in, which I
do not appreciate.

350
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,600
And hear me out on this one.
It's a little weird.

351
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,889
I'm thinking about doing
something to my earlobes.

352
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,590
I've never really liked
my earlobes. Jesus!

353
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:10,473
What?

354
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,512
How's that eye feel?

355
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:14,432
Oh, it feels a little weird.

356
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,109
I'm having a little trouble
seeing out of it.

357
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,550
- That's normal, right?
- I don't think so.

358
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,878
It's not? Really?

359
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:22,236
God, now that you mention it, sis, I do
feel a fair amount of pain coming on.

360
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,767
God, it stings.

361
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,055
Shit, Dennis, I think maybe
I switched these up.

362
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:28,528
You switched 'em up?

363
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,826
- I don't know. I'm thinking...
- What the hell!

364
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,024
Maybe I put some
collagen in your eye.

365
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,181
You injected Mexican
collagen in my eye?!

366
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,155
Sorry. I can't handle the
stress you're giving me right now.

367
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,473
My heart is very weak.
It's a lot of pressure.

368
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:39,270
Oh, God, I think I'm
going blind in one eye.

369
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:40,985
Well, hold on a second.
I feel very weird.

370
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,041
I'm going blind.

371
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,249
I feel like my heart
might explode.

372
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:52,248
Are you feeling better today?

373
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,995
I like to hear that.

374
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,191
Now take your medication.

375
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:02,964
Good.

376
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:07,508
That's good.

377
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,081
Hello, Chief.

378
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,378
They're onto me, dude.

379
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:15,756
Those guys are sharp
as nails up there.

380
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,259
You can't put
anything past them.

381
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,895
Oh, my God, dude,
I'm freaking out.

382
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,101
I am so stressed out. I feel like
I'm having a panic attack.

383
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,938
You want to talk about stress?
You want to talk about stress?!

384
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,014
Okay? I've stumbled onto a major
company conspiracy, Mac.

385
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,247
How about that for stress?

386
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,433
What the hell
are you talking about?

387
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,998
This company is being bled
like a stuck pig, Mac,

388
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,407
and I got a paper
trail to prove it.

389
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,499
Check this out.

390
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,535
Take a look at this.

391
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,810
- Jesus Christ, Charlie.
- That right there is the mail.

392
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:38,867
Now, let's talk about the mail.

393
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,229
Can we talk about
the mail, please, Mac?

394
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:42,459
I've been dying to talk about
the mail with you all day, okay?

395
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,765
Pepe Silvia... This name keeps
coming up over and over again.

396
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:46,826
Every day, Pepe's mail's
getting sent back to me.

397
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:50,383
I look in the mail.
This whole box is Pepe Silvia.

398
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,215
So, I say to myself,
I got to find this guy.

399
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:53,366
I got to go up to his office.

400
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,060
I got to put his mail in the
guy's goddamn hands.

401
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,046
Otherwise he's never
gonna get it.

402
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:57,291
He's gonna keep coming
back down here,

403
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:00,543
so I go up to Pepe's office, and what
do I find out? What do I find out?!

404
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,865
There is no Pepe Silvia.

405
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:04,286
The man does not exist, okay?

406
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,449
So, I decide,

407
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,163
"Oh, shit, buddy.
I got to dig a little deeper."

408
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:08,255
There's no Pepe Silvia.

409
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,357
You got to be kidding me.
I got boxes full of Pepe!

410
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,997
All right, so I start marching
my way down to Carol in HR,

411
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,841
and I knock on her door,
and I say,

412
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,275
Carol, I got to talk
to you about Pepe."

413
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,142
And when I open the door,
what do I find?

414
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,925
There's not a single,
goddamn desk in that office.

415
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:27,624
There is no Carol in HR.

416
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:31,232
Mac, half the employees in this
building have been made up.

417
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,834
This office is
a goddamn ghost town.

418
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,805
Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna have
to stop you right there.

419
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:41,255
Not only do all of these people
exist, but they have been asking

420
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,043
for their mail on a daily basis.

421
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,390
It's all they're talking
about up there.

422
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:46,293
Jesus Christ, dude, we are going
to lose our jobs.

423
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:48,791
Well, calm down, 'cause here's
one thing that's not gonna happen.

424
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:49,636
What?

425
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,198
We're not gonna get fired.

426
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,008
We're not?

427
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:53,851
'Cause we've already been fired.

428
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,776
We've lost our jobs?!

429
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,537
About three days ago, a couple
of pink slips came in the mail.

430
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,123
One for you and one for
me. So what did I do?

431
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,755
I mailed them halfway
to Siberia, okay?

432
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:03,729
Charlie, if we've lost our jobs,
that means we've lost

433
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,324
our health insurance, which
means all of this was for nothing.

434
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,378
Goddamn it, dude.
I'm having a panic attack.

435
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:09,764
I am actually having
a panic attack.

436
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,589
Oh, will you settle down and
have another cup of coffee?

437
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,782
I am, bro.

438
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,379
- All right, well, fine.
- You know what, Barney?

439
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:16,164
Give this guy a cigarette.
He's freaking out.

440
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,244
Who?

441
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:20,646
Barney. He's the guy who
tipped me off to Pepe Silvia.

442
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,559
Barney?! Who
the hell is Barney?!

443
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,534
You don't see Bar...?

444
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,234
Oh, shit, where
the hell did he...?

445
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,843
You've lost your mind.

446
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:30,259
You've lost your
goddamn mind, Charlie.

447
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,068
Jesus Christ, dude, will you
forget the mail, all right?

448
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,418
Forget the mail?

449
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,332
The mail's the most important
thing in the world now.

450
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:42,307
Dude, you're gonna give me
another panic attack.

451
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,540
- You have a cigarette?
- I hear Barney.

452
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,735
Where's Barney, huh?

453
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:46,719
How long is the wait
at this place?!

454
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:48,575
We have been here
for hours and hours.

455
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,089
Goddamn Frank.

456
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,475
Where the hell is he?

457
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,032
Shit!
Where am I?

458
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,419
Tonto...
Come here.

459
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,740
Come on, bub, let's go.

460
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,959
Get up. You got
to help me out here.

461
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:35,252
Pick this up and throw it
through this window.

462
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,973
Pick... throw.

463
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,021
That's it.

464
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:55,765
That's it.

465
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:57,348
One...

466
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,481
Two...

467
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,998
and three.

468
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:04,048
Beautiful.

469
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,871
Come on. Let's get
the hell out of here.

470
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,873
Come on.
You go first.
