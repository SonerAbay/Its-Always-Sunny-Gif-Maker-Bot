00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:03,478
MAC: A reading from the Holy
Bible.

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:06,714
Genesis, chapter one.
"God created the heaven and the

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,940
earth, and the earth was without
form and void, and darkness was

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,148
upon the face of the deep..."
DENNIS: Hey, buddy, do we

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:12,546
have to be kneeling this entire
time?

6
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,498
DEE: Yeah, this is not
comfortable.

7
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:14,615
I mean, it's gonna get
uncomfortable.

8
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,818
Yes, you need to be kneeling.
It's 11:58, and Mac Day's about

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,343
to officially start.
I want there to be ceremony.

10
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:21,429
FRANK: Are we gonna be in the
dark the whole time?

11
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,598
My goodness, this is a lot of
complaining.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,534
Charlie, can you please remind
everyone of the rules?

13
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:27,502
CHARLIE: We are about to
officially begin Mac Day.

14
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,471
For the entirety of this day, we
will forced to do everything Mac

15
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:31,439
wants us to do.
And if anyone is caught

16
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,575
complaining?
An extra day is added to Mac

17
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,744
Day.
If you cannot resist the urge to

18
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,679
complain, you are allowed one
scream a day to the ceremonial

19
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,881
screaming pillow.
That's right.

20
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,850
Charlie, when it was your day,
did I complain about searching

21
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:43,985
for goblins for ten hours
straight?

22
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:45,954
Well, ghouls, and, no, they
didn't complain, 'cause we found

23
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:47,923
three. It was pretty sweet.
We found none.

24
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,858
Yeah?
We found no ghouls, we found

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,995
no goblins, we found no gremlins,
because they don't exist. Well...

26
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,931
Guys, this whole thing was
meant to bring us closer

27
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,899
together, and by the end of it,
you're gonna feel a little bit

28
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:02,237
closer to me, and if I've done my job
right, a little bit closer to God. Yes.

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,205
Because I've modeled my day
after the seven days of God's

30
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,541
creation, making my one day feel
like an entire week.

31
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:08,677
Oh!
Come on, man. Really?

32
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,645
Oh, come on, will you?
For crying out loud, my knees

33
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:13,014
are...
(overlapping chatter)

34
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:18,913
Three, two, one, begin! On the first
day, God said, "Let there be...

35
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:22,648
Mac."

36

37
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:48,203
Seven straight hours
of lecturing?

38
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:51,410
Yeah, and five hours alone dedicated to
the evils of homosexuality... from him?

39
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,713
Did anyone else notice that he
had an erection the entire time?

40
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:54,380
Of course.

41
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,147
How could you miss it?

42
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,049
I mean, it was, like, shooting...
It was right there.

43
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,468
Shh, shh, shh-- here he comes.

44
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:01,755
Okay, guys, I want to introduce
a new theme to the day.

45
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:05,559
So I'd like to infuse the religious
angle with the theme of badass.

46
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:08,228
And I quote once
again from Genesis.

47
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,230
"And God said, 'Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the

48
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:13,620
waters, and let it divide the
waters from the waters.'

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,707
And God made the firmament and
divided the waters which were

50
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,910
under the firmament from the
waters which were above the

51
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,245
firmament.
And it was so."

52
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,614
There you have it.
There we have what?

53
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:25,016
Uh, the what...?
What are you saying?

54
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,152
It's water.
I'm saying "water," 'cause it

55
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:29,287
said water, like, eight times.
So, it's water.

56
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,489
That's what the whole thing is--
water.

57
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:36,027
Water what? Water and badass,
badass and water. Ah.

58
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,196
Yes!
We're doing a <i>Project Badass</i>

59
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:40,598
<i>video over the Schuylkill River.</i>
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,934
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Yes!</i>

61
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,303
<i>Ah.</i>
<i>All right! Hey!</i>

62
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,539
<i>Do you guys hear the</i>
<i>motorcycle?</i>

63
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,507
<i>I have another special surprise.</i>
<i>We will be joined by my cousin</i>

64
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,843
<i>all day!</i>
<i>Your cousin?</i>

65
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,012
<i>Yeah, my cousin from the</i>
<i>country.</i>

66
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,980
<i>I haven't seen him in, like,</i>
<i>forever, but, guys, trust me.</i>

67
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,949
<i>He's, like, the second biggest</i>
<i>badass I know, so it's gonna</i>

68
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,118
<i>be awesome.</i>
<i>Country Mac coming to the big</i>

<i>(Frank groans)</i>

00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:04,856
<i>Country Mac!</i>
<i>COUNTRY MAC: Hey, City Mac!</i>

71
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:08,626
<i>(laughter)</i>
<i>(both make wind-whipping sounds)</i>

72
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:14,432
<i>(wind-whipping sounds continue)</i>

73
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:21,906
<i>Holy shit, there's two of them.</i>

74
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:26,578
<i>Okay, I think I like this</i>
<i>framing.</i>

75
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,680
<i>I don't even know what it is</i>
<i>you want us to do.</i>

76
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,582
<i>Well, I'm gonna jump from the</i>
<i>Strawberry Mansion Bridge.</i>

77
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,917
<i>What?!</i>
<i>Yes!</i>

78
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,086
<i>Holy shit!</i>
<i>What do you mean, from it?</i>

79
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,488
<i>To the water?</i>
<i>What?!</i>

80
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,490
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna jump from the</i>
<i>top of the bridge to the water.</i>

81
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:41,159
<i>Okay, I need you to act like</i>
<i>concerned citizens, but I need</i>

82
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:43,094
<i>this to feel real, okay, guys?</i>
<i>So, I need you to be neutral</i>

83
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:45,096
<i>about the jumper prior to the</i>
<i>jump, 'cause you don't know me.</i>

84
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,898
<i>You don't know this man.</i>
<i>But I need you to react at the</i>

85
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,766
<i>same time because I need to draw</i>
<i>the jump in later to match your</i>

86
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,802
<i>reaction.</i>
<i>You lost me there.</i>

87
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,237
<i>What do you mean, "Draw the</i>
<i>jump?"</i>

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,038
<i>You're not jumping?</i>
<i>No, I'm not gonna jump.</i>

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,007
<i>Of course I wouldn't jump.</i>
<i>I draw it in later because it's</i>

90
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,176
<i>like a post effect.</i>
<i>Well, what's badass about</i>

91
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:00,378
<i>that?</i>
<i>Your reaction is badass, you</i>

92
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,513
<i>know?</i>
<i>I want you to scream, "Badass!</i>

93
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,482
<i>You know, that dude is badass!</i>
<i>I've never seen anything as</i>

94
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:06,351
<i>badass as that." You know?</i>
<i>Oh...</i>

95
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:08,620
<i>But don't say my name, 'cause</i>
<i>you don't know this man.</i>

96
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,989
<i>That's why it feels real, you</i>
<i>know?</i>

97
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:12,991
<i>Now, later, if you want to do,</i>
<i>like, a Rudy-type situation</i>

98
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:14,959
<i>where you carry me through the</i>
<i>streets of Philadelphia, you</i>

99
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,328
<i>know, that's cool.</i>
<i>We won't.</i>

100
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,697
<i>I can put that in the schedule.</i>

101
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,866
<i>It's not a post effect?</i>
<i>No, that's a practical</i>

102
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:23,835
<i>fect, that would happen real,</i>
<i>but only if it's organic, you</i>

103
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,970
<i>know?</i>
<i>This is a goddamn mess, this</i>

104
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,872
<i>whole thing's a goddamn mess.</i>
<i>I'm lost, I'm lost.</i>

105
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:30,008
<i>You guys lost?</i>
<i>You're not gonna be badass,</i>

106
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,943
<i>but you're gonna...</i>
<i>And we're not gonna react?</i>

107
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,811
<i>This is all sounding a little</i>
<i>bit like a complaint from you</i>

108
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:36,014
<i>guys.</i>
<i>Who's complaining?!</i>

109
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,016
<i>We don't know what's going on!</i>
<i>We don't know you.</i>

<i>(chanting): Mac! Mac! Mac!</i>
<i>Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!</i>

<i>Badass! Badass! Badass!</i>
<i>ALL: Badass! Badass!</i>

<i>All right, Country Mac, let's</i>

<i>Keep it going. Keep it going.</i>

<i>Let's do this! Let's do this!</i>
<i>Badass.</i>

<i>It's excellent, it's gonna be</i>

117
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,935
<i>great.</i>
<i>You better jump quick before</i>

118
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:59,871
<i>somebody tries to stop you.</i>
<i>Trust me, no one's gonna try</i>

119
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:02,273
<i>and stop me.</i>
<i>Jump, asshole!</i>

120
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,142
<i>Yep. See, in the big city,</i>
<i>nobody cares whether you live or</i>

<i>All right, have a nice day.</i>
<i>Okay, so, I'm gonna run to the</i>

<i>end, book as fast as I can to</i>
<i>the fence, climb up to the top,</i>

00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:15,420
<i>stop, climb back down to safety.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

125
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:21,225
<i>So, you're not gonna jump?</i>
<i>I don't jump, okay?</i>

126
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,394
<i>Why does everybody think I jump?</i>
<i>Nobody jumps.</i>

127

<i>Evel Knievel didn't jump.</i>
<i>Johnny Knoxville doesn't jump.</i>

128
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,532
<i>Okay, this is big Hollywood</i>
<i>stuff, okay? Just stand back.</i>

129
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:32,870
<i>I don't want you to get hurt.</i>
<i>Let me handle it.</i>

130
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,839
<i>Oh, wow! Oh, there's a man</i>
<i>standing on the bridge.</i>

131
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,175
<i>What?!</i>
<i>Yes, he looks like...</i>

132
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:39,544
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>His name is Mac.</i>

133
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:41,746
<i>No, we don't know his name.</i>
<i>We don't know it.</i>

134
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:43,881
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>His name is Rudy, I believe,</i>

135
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:46,050
<i>you guys.</i>
<i>That's what it was-- Rudy.</i>

136
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:48,019
<i>We don't know what his</i>
<i>name is, and that's okay, but we</i>

137
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:50,154
<i>don't know each other. Hi.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

138
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,290
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>Oh, hi, hi, but it looks like</i>

139
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,325
<i>he may commit suicide.</i>
<i>Ah!</i>

140
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:55,393
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>Suicide is badass.</i>

141
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:56,894
<i>Right!</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, Rudy's not</i>

142
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,429
<i>trying to kill himself.</i>
<i>We don't know his name.</i>

143
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,631
<i>He just likes to jump, I guess.</i>

144
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:01,332
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</i>
<i>Mac is the one who's the</i>

145
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,433
<i>badass, remember that.</i>
<i>Badass.</i>

146
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:03,668
<i>No, we don't... Will you</i>
<i>stop, stop, stop?</i>

147
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,869
<i>Everybody stop. Come on, guys.</i>
<i>What are we doing?</i>

148
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,170
<i>I don't know what we're doing.</i>

149
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,538
<i>We got to get on the same page.</i>

150
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,740
<i>It's so unclear.</i>
<i>He gave us, like...</i>

151
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,308
<i>Don't know what we're doing.</i>
<i>Maybe just you talk.</i>

152
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,909
<i>Well, whatever it is, we got</i>
<i>to get on the same page.</i>

153
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,611
<i>Otherwise, we're gonna have to</i>
<i>do it over and over and over...</i>

154
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:14,979
<i>(water splashing)</i>
<i>Did someone just go plop?</i>

155
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,748
<i>Looked like it.</i>
<i>Someone just jumped.</i>

156
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,816
<i>Someone jumped.</i>
<i>He jumped! That's it!</i>

157
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:22,053
<i>He jumped, guys! He jumped!</i>
<i>The day's over, the day's over.</i>

158
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,921
<i>Country Mac is gone, he's dead.</i>
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

159
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,823
<i>Look! Look, look, look!</i>
<i>What? What? Oh.</i>

160
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,892
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>Oh, holy shit! Oh, my God!</i>

161
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:30,762
<i>Oh, wow! Wow!</i>
<i>Whoa!</i>

162
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:32,730
<i>Well, how'd that look?</i>
<i>Oh, amazing! All right!</i>

163
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,565
<i>How did it look?</i>
<i>How'd it look? Badass!</i>

164
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,534
<i>It looked badass, dude.</i>
<i>I cannot believe you jumped.</i>

165
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,469
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>No, that's not really</i>

166
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:40,438
<i>badass, guys. That's dangerous.</i>
<i>Um, can we put him on our</i>

167
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,607
<i>shoulders and parade him around</i>
<i>like Rudy?</i>

168
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,509
<i>I'm feeling that now.</i>
<i>I want to do that.</i>

169
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,577
<i>I'm feeling that now.</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah...</i>

170
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,446
<i>(overlapping chatter)</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no, I don't</i>

171
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:50,415
<i>think that's gonna work anymore.</i>
<i>That's not gonna fit into our</i>

172
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,316
<i>schedule, you know? I mean...</i>
<i>I mean, it was your idea...</i>

173
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,152
<i>(overlapping chatter)</i>
<i>No, we're very full.</i>

174
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,920
<i>We're very full now.</i>
<i>This is not gonna play.</i>

175
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,055
<i>We're gonna move on to day four</i>
<i>now.</i>

176
00:06:58,057 --> 00:06:59,891
<i>Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>You skipped day three.</i>

177
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,826
<i>Uh, day three is when God</i>
<i>created trees and grass and</i>

178
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,995
<i>nature.</i>
<i>You know, kind of a bullshit</i>

179
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,930
<i>day, so we're gonna move on to</i>
<i>day four where God created the</i>

180
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:09,534
<i>stars.</i>

181
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:15,606
<i>If you look at the Orion</i>
<i>constellation and then track</i>

182
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:19,210
<i>across to the Big Dipper, you'll</i>
<i>see a gaseous, cloud-like area.</i>

183
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:21,813
<i>(quietly): Okay, I'm gonna</i>
<i>need you guys to go ahead and</i>

184
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:25,049
<i>ignore everything that this</i>
<i>clown is saying.</i>

185
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:27,752
<i>God created the stars 5,000</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

186
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,754
<i>Uh, who has the pillow?</i>
<i>I need a pillow.</i>

187
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:32,123
<i>(can clicks open)</i>
<i>I think I thought of a way</i>

188
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,158
<i>that we can work day three into</i>
<i>this experience.</i>

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,128
<i>No, we're on day four.</i>
<i>And, besides, there's no trees</i>

190
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,730
<i>or herbs in the planetarium.</i>
<i>But there's herb.</i>

191
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:42,099
<i>Hmm?</i>
<i>Who wants to smoke a "J"?</i>

192
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,902
<i>Oh, shit. You brought weed?</i>
<i>No, no, no, we're not smoking</i>

193
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:46,971
<i>weed, okay?</i>
<i>It's still illegal in the state</i>

194
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:48,973
<i>of Pennsylvania.</i>
<i>Puff, puff, pass, bitches.</i>

195
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,942
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah, come on, Mac, shut up.</i>

196
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:53,244
<i>I thought you were a badass.</i>
<i>(sighs) There's nothing</i>

197
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:55,446
<i>badass about breaking the law,</i>
<i>Charlie.</i>

198
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:58,249
<i>(coughs) This is gonna make</i>
<i>it way more fun, dude.</i>

199
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:01,552
<i>This isn't about fun.</i>
<i>It's about fearing God, okay?</i>

200
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,521
<i>I'm trying to convert you guys.</i>
<i>Oh, my God, is that what this</i>

201
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,523
<i>is about?</i>
<i>You're not gonna convert me in</i>

202
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,492
<i>one day.</i>
<i>I don't believe in God.</i>

203
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,594
<i>Well, you should.</i>
<i>Because if you don't, God will</i>

204
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:13,331
<i>make a flood or a famine, okay?</i>
<i>He will destroy you with</i>

205
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,967
<i>tornadoes and earthquakes and</i>
<i>AIDS.</i>

206
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,935
<i>Where do you think AIDS came</i>
<i>from?</i>

207
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:19,937
<i>Uh, hello, God's gift to the</i>
<i>gays.</i>

208
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,906
<i>Oh...</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

209
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:23,875
<i>You're gonna ruin this high,</i>
<i>dude.</i>

210
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,043
<i>Mac, I think you're a little</i>
<i>confused there.</i>

211
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:29,213
<i>I mean, yeah, sure, bad things</i>
<i>do happen.</i>

212
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:35,253
<i>But what about sunsets? Oh...
French kisses. Oh...</i>

213
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,555
<i>The smell of rain.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

214
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:41,058
<i>That's why I believe in God.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

215
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,161
<i>Not because of the things</i>
<i>that he takes away from us but</i>

216
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:46,464
<i>because of the things that he</i>
<i>gives to us.</i>

217
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,766
<i>Oh... dude.</i>
<i>Shit, dude.</i>

218
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,768
<i>You just ripped a hole in my</i>
<i>mind.</i>

219
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,737
<i>See, that's the God I l...</i>
<i>I like that.</i>

220
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,605
<i>I'm choosing that one.</i>
<i>Excuse me, who's talking back</i>

221
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,241
<i>there?</i>
<i>Shut up, science bitch.</i>

222
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:01,112
<i>(Charlie, Dennis, Dee laugh)</i>
<i>Yeah. Yeah, shut up, science</i>

223
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,080
<i>bitch!</i>
<i>Aw, dude, dude, dude.</i>

224
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,882
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>He just said it.</i>

225
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:09,120
<i>He just said it.</i>
<i>He just did it.</i>

226
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:16,427
<i>(whirring)</i>
<i>Oh. What the hell?</i>

227
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:19,630
<i>(machine bangs)</i>
<i>Carbs-wise, this is gonna set</i>

228
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,666
<i>me back, but I don't even give a</i>
<i>shit.</i>

229
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,734
<i>(machine bangs)</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

230
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:25,536
<i>Country Mac's awesome.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

231
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,505
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>This weed that he gave us is</i>

232
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:31,676
<i>awesome. It's... Yes. Yeah.</i>

233
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:35,947
<i>All these years I've been</i>
<i>feeling like I hate karate.</i>

234
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:42,019
<i>And, like, I hate Project</i>
<i>Badass</i> and, like... I hate God.

235
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:51,629
Yes. But, like... I realize... you
know what I really hate... is Mac.

236
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:57,768
Yes. Like, he's made all those cool things suck.
Not only is he, like,

237
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,973
rui... ning my life...
but with all this God shit that

238
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:08,145
he's into... he could be
ruining my afterlife. Yes.

239
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,557
(Mac grunts) I thought that
one was gonna... Let me try.

240
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:21,668
So...
Yeah, I get that.

241
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,715
Okay, I feel like we got a
little bit off the rails back

242
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:31,235
there, but I'm ready to get back
on.

243
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,225
Dude, did you guys see the
way Country Mac was riding his

244
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:35,060
motorcycle?
Badass, dude!

245
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:37,028
No, it was reckless once again.

246
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,830
I thought it was awesome!
He was like Batman, just

247
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,799
zipping through the cars.
He beat us here by, like, an

248
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,436
hour. Oh, I want to get a motorcycle, man.
Dude, we should all get

249
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:46,404
motorcycles!
Okay, that's enough! Okay?

250
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,206
Enough about Country Mac.
It's still my day.

251
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,041
Yeah.
Thank you.

252
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:52,010
On the fifth day, God made fish,
so we'll just skip right past

253
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,812
that.
Yeah, we'll skip that.

254
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,614
You're skipping a lot of days,
dude.

255
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:57,616
Well, you can't fit it all
into one day.

256
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,417
That's preposterous.
You're the one who came up

257
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,586
with the structure, so... that's
preposterous.

258
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:04,389
All right, on the sixth day,
God created the beasts of the

259
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:08,226
earth and he made man in his own
image.

260
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:13,098
And beholdeth... the image of
God.

261
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,970
(techno music playing)
Oh, shit.

262
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,806
Okay, everybody grab some
grease.

263
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:27,579
Why? Because we're gonna grease up these beefcakes.
No! No! Come on! No!

264
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:30,081
Easy, Frank.
Frank, you better take it easy!

265
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,984
Listen! These guys work off
their beautiful glutes for our

266
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:35,320
enjoyment, okay?
The least we can do is pay them

267
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,355
back in tan and grease.
(sighs) Greasing dudes.

268
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,424
Yep.
That's why we're here today.

269
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:41,660
I ain't doing this!
About time you guys got here.

270
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,095
Hey, there you are.
Country Mac, man. Hey, bro.

271
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,064
Listen, dude, can you get us out
of here?

272
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,033
Yeah, you got to get us out
of here, man.

273
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:50,001
Get out of here?
I'm lovin' it.

274
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:52,037
I've been gettin' phone numbers
left and right.

275
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,272
Oh, sweet, there's chicks here?

276
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:57,209
Chicks? No.
Dudes.

277
00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:01,246
I'm into dudes.
Oh... you're gay.

278

grease them, you know?

It doe... Right.
He wants them for himself.

when someone's gay and open

And, like, I know we've never

Mac's gay.

I'm gonna freak out, and I'm

No, no, no. We'll grease,

We're gonna watch you fight?

304

No, day seven is God's day of

So I'm gonna sit back and watch

tournament.

00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,807
<i>We would become more like</i>
<i>Country Mac, which'd be great.</i>

422
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,642
<i>We have a lot to learn from</i>
<i>him.</i>

423
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:56,344
<i>We should all get motorcycles.</i>
<i>And drink much more beer.</i>

424
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:57,712
<i>And smoke more weed, you guys.</i>

425
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,080
<i>And get in fights and do all</i>
<i>those things.</i>

426
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:00,482
<i>Can we make this happen</i>
<i>before he comes back out...?</i>

427
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,517
<i>Let's talk to him, let's talk</i>
<i>to him.</i>

428
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,786
<i>Hey, um... hey, Country Mac, can</i>
<i>we just talk to you for one</i>

429
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,754
<i>quick second, buddy?</i>
<i>Um, listen, we were just talking</i>

430
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,891
<i>and, man, we sure would like for</i>
<i>you to stay with us.</i>

431
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,160
<i>I mean, like-like, stay with us</i>
<i>forever.</i>

432
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,696
<i>Will you be part of our gang?</i>
<i>Yep.</i>

433
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:17,866
<i>Uh... just "yep"?</i>
<i>Just, like... That's it?</i>

434
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,834
<i>You're not gonna give a speech</i>
<i>or lecture us or anything like</i>

435
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:21,836
<i>that?</i>
<i>No bossiness?</i>

436
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:25,173
<i>No pontificating?</i>
<i>It's not my style.</i>

437
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:28,109
<i>I just go with the flow.</i>
<i>Let the wind blow through my</i>

438
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:30,078
<i>hair.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

439
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,280
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>(starts engine)</i>

440
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:35,250
<i>Oh, wow.</i>
<i>I love that guy.</i>

441
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:39,320
<i>Aw, look at him go.</i>
<i>Where's he even going?</i>

442
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:41,289
<i>I mean, the fact that we</i>
<i>don't know where he's going</i>

443
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,925
<i>makes him all the more badass.</i>
<i>Uh-oh. Whoops.</i>

444
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,927
<i>Whoopsie.</i>
<i>He fell, huh?</i>

445
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,729
<i>Tipped over a little bit.</i>
<i>Ooh.</i>

446
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,731
<i>He's probably okay, though,</i>
<i>right?</i>

447
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,699
<i>Well, yeah, he just... popped</i>
<i>over.</i>

448
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,902
<i>A little-little bump.</i>
<i>He's fine. He's good, he's good,</i>

449
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:56,804
<i>he's good, he's good.</i>
<i>(bagpipes playing)</i>

450
00:18:56,806 --> 00:19:02,944
<i>Country Mac lived a reckless</i>
<i>life.</i>

451
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:08,049
<i>He wasn't the kind of guy that</i>
<i>could score a point in a black</i>

452
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:12,053
<i>belt karate contest.</i>
<i>And it turns out, he was totally</i>

453
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:16,324
<i>queer.</i>
<i>Which, as we all know, is a sin.</i>

454
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:18,993
<i>And that, coupled with his</i>
<i>radical religious beliefs, has</i>

455
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:24,666
<i>most likely landed him in Hell,</i>
<i>where he will burn for all</i>

456
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,869
<i>eternity.</i>
<i>So I will ask for a moment of</i>

457
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,407
<i>silence, in which I will beg</i>
<i>God's forgiveness for Country</i>

458
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:38,146
<i>Mac's evil, homo ways, while</i>
<i>simultaneously doing a series of</i>

459
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:44,452
<i>karate moves that I know Country</i>
<i>Mac would've enjoyed so much.</i>

460
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:48,356
<i>(exhaling)</i>
<i>Well, guys, I think the real</i>

461
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,358
<i>lesson here is that there's</i>
<i>nothing badass about riding a</i>

462
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,327
<i>motorcycle without a helmet.</i>
<i>Right.</i>

463
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,329
<i>Plus, he was drunk all the</i>
<i>time.</i>

464
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,297
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>You know what's badass?</i>

465
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,266
<i>Being alive.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

466
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:01,502
<i>So, uh, what do we do about this</i>
<i>guy?</i>

467
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:08,009
<i>(Mac exhaling)</i>
<i>>> Namaste. Namaste.</i>

468
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:10,912
<i>Okay, we will now pile into the</i>
<i>car, where we will go to the</i>

469
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,815
<i>countryside to leave Country</i>
<i>Mac's ashes in a place that he</i>

470
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:16,451
<i>loved so well.</i>
<i>Actually, we won't.</i>

471
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:21,256
<i>Because it's officially Frank</i>
<i>Day, so...</i>

472
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:27,244
<i>(toilet flushing)</i>
<i>All right, Pee Country Mac.</i>
