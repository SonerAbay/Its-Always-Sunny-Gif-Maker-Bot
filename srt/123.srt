1
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:03,124
<i>Okay, so there we were.</i>

2
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:04,426
<i>We're in the brig
and the whole ship just,</i>

3
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:05,894
you know, bumps; we get
thrown against the the wall.

4
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:07,195
Yeah. You know, the-the
lights are going off.

5
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,097
The sirens are blaring.
Whoa, whoa.

6
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

7
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,467
How did we get in the
brig in the first place?

8
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:14,063
What do you mean, Frank?
You were there.

9
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,464
I'm very cloudy
about the beginning.

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,832
I think I need a recap.

11
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,617
Recap?
A recap would be good, you know?

12
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:20,169
Just to kind of brush up
on everything that happened.

13
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:21,604
A recap...
Now, see, I forgot that.

14
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:22,938
...honestly might be good
because, you know,

15
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:23,973
we want him
to be completely clear

16
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:25,141
before the final judgment.

17
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:26,525
All right, you know,
Right, yeah.

18
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:27,743
the amount of energy
we're using talking

19
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:28,978
about whether
or not we should recap,

20
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,479
we may as well just recap,
so fine, fine.

21
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:31,914
So there we were.
We're on a Christian cruise.

22
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:33,015
Yeah, we're all thrown
in the brig

23
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:34,183
for various sins
that we committed.

24
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:36,085
Me, admittedly,
for a little bit of lust.

25
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:37,420
Um, and in summation,
we're all good people,

26
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:38,554
asking for forgiveness.

27
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:39,789
My thing, not a rape.

28
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:41,424
Move on; you're
losing him.

29
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,792
Move on; you're losing him.
I just want to be clear.

30
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:44,564
Okay, yeah, yeah.
I just wanted to be clear.

31
00:00:53,084 --> 00:01:03,751

32
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,209
What the hell is that?

33
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,577
What're those sirens for?

34
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,646
Oh, God.
Oh, my God, see, I knew

35
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,281
I shouldn't have
come on this cruise.

36
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:19,384
I knew it! I mean, it used to be
I would never even leave Philly!

37
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:20,986
And then, you know,
you guys drag me to this,

38
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:23,221
you drag me to that,
and next thing I know,

39
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,957
I-I'm stuck in a box
on a sinking ship!

40
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,792
Hold on, the boat's not sinking.
How do you know that?

41
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:28,894
How do you know it's not...?

42
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:31,229
Well... Oh.

43
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:32,831
There you go. It stopped.

44
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,532
All right, uh,
I guess that's good.

45
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,868
I mean, like...
like, if something went wrong,

46
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:38,970
they-they'd come down here,
they'd get us, right?

47
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,205
You know what, guys,
what difference does it make?

48
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,206
You know?

49
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,924
Life is just a series of events

50
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,327
with no meaning or plan,
you know?

51
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:47,078
It's like, we live, we die,

52
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:50,348
we're gay, we're straight,
we're tops, we're bottoms.

53
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,250
Wait, wait, wait.
Calm down, everybody.

54
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,619
We're gonna be
in the Bahamas in an hour.

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,255
Well, you sure? Like, I...
I don't think we're moving.

56
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:59,991
We're moving. I can hear
the engine buzzing like crazy.

57
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,993
No, I think Charlie's right.

58
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,162
I-I don't think that we're
moving, and-and besides,

59
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,398
the buzzing would be,
like, an electrical system.

60
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,233
You know?
The engine sounds more like...

61
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,037
Yeah, maybe on a speedboat.
This is a big cruise ship.

62
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:14,072
It's got like a big,
deep sound; it's like a...

63
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:18,710
Yeah, if you're starting
the engine, but, like,

64
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:20,578
we would be hearing a steady...

65
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,047
Gah, gah, gah, gah,
gah, gah, gah, gah...

66
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:23,515
No, no, you
guys are all wrong.

67
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,650
No, boats are mostly
computerized these days,

68
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,319
so the engine barely
makes any noise at all.

69
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,254
I mean, they-they make
a fake noise

70
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:32,290
to-to make people feel better,
but it's like...

71
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,059
But it's fake, it's not...
it's not real, you know?

72
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,493
It's kind of like how I carry
a little piece of onion

73
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:36,995
around with me to elicit tears,
you know,

74
00:02:37,064 --> 00:02:38,630
in case someone needs me
to feel something

75
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:40,932
about what they said or
are doing, you know what I mean?

76
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,501
Do you have an onion in
your pocket right now? No.

77
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:46,004
No, I'm taking
a vacation from myself.

78
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,689
W-Was it a vacation
from hearing, okay?

79
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:50,141
'Cause if the engine was going,
we would hear a gah, gah, gah,

80
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,043
gah, gah, gah, gah...
Are you deaf, Charlie?

81
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:54,946
I was like...

82
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,208
I mean, that's ridiculous! All right, okay,
all right. All right, all right, all right!

83
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:08,994
Goddamn! Okay, look.

84
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:10,829
Let's just, let's all agree

85
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,347
that it doesn't sound
like a speedboat,

86
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:13,665
or something
that's off-roading, all right?

87
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,100
It does make a little
bit of a buzz.

88
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:16,735
Yeah?

89
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,902
But most modern ships
these days, their engines,

90
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:19,337
they don't make a lot of noise,

91
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,572
that they do make
a little bit of noise.

92
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:21,824
Can we all just agree on this?

93
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,808
Yeah.
Fine, I can live with that.

94
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,860
I can live with it.
Fine.

95
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,778
Okay, all right.

96
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:27,812
How long have we been
talking about this?

97
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,498
Four hours, six minutes.

98
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:35,120
Well, there's some pros
and some cons, guys.

99
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,972
Pro: We've cut our conflict
resolution time in half.

100
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:40,058
Four hours, that's good for us.

101
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:41,826
That's-that's huge,
that's huge.

102
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,562
Con: Charlie's right,
the ship is probably not moving

103
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,981
because we definitely would've
been in the Bahamas by now.

104
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,366
What?

105
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,435
Yep.
Oh.

106
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:52,303
Well, that's not good, right?
I mean...

107
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:53,354
No. It's not good.

108
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,907
I mean, f-four hours?

109
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,308
Well...
The-the boat not moving!

110
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,060
No one comes down
to say anything like,

111
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,812
"Hey, guys, there's something
wrong with the ship!"

112
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,381
No, they've forgotten about us!

113
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,749
And we're gonna die in here!
Oh, my God, I'm freaking out.

114
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,384
We got to get out of here.
Help! Help!

115
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:07,619
Calm down, Charlie.

116
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:08,953
Help us!
Charlie!

117
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:10,455
You got to help!
Hey! Hey!

118
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:12,791
Oi, oi, oi, oi,
oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

119
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,759
Mm, yep, yep, yep. Mm.

120
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,927
Whoa.
Yeah?

121
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,028
Yep.
Oi, oi, oi.

122
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:18,229
What-what was that, dude?

123
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:19,998
You sound like
a soccer hooligan.

124
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,583
Uh, yeah, that's just something
I've been doing

125
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:22,934
with Charlie lately
when he gets a little wound up.

126
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,536
You know, it seems to work.

127
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:25,970
- Say yup, yup, yup.
- Oh, that's good.

128
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,572
The most important thing
for us to do now

129
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,174
is to keep our wits together.

130
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,408
We got to occupy ourselves.
Mm-hmm.

131
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,761
Why don't we play a few games?

132
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:34,446
No, no! I just wanted to
get away from you guys,

133
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:36,047
just for a few days.

134
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,482
Now we're stuck in a box,

135
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:38,633
and you're gonna play
some games now?

136
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,219
You know what? I'm out.

137
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:42,637
What?

138
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,162
What the hell
do you mean you're out?

139
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:46,224
- I'm out. Nobody talk to me.
- No, Dee.

140
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:47,659
That's not a very good idea.

141
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,394
You know when my dad was
in solitary confinement,

142
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,930
I used to write to him
every day to see how it was.

143
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:54,349
He never wrote back, but if
he did, he would've said,

144
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,701
"Son, you've got to keep
your mind active.

145
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,736
Also, I love you."

146
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,138
Uh, are you
sure he wouldn't say,

147
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:02,991
"Remind me who you are again"?

148
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,876
Ho!

149
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,811
That was great!
That was Luther!

150
00:05:06,897 --> 00:05:08,480
My-my-my dad knows who I am.
Yeah-yeah.

151
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:09,948
Hey-hey do the voice again,
but this time say,

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,382
"I love you, son."
Nah.

153
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,667
Oh.
But, no, that's

154
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,786
a good distraction,
like, um, you know,

155
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,905
like any kind of impressions
you got, like any kind of...

156
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,339
You want to hear me do
a couple of impressions?

157
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:19,791
That'd be fun. Yeah,
okay, so let's see.

158
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,743
All right, so let me know
which ones you want to hear.

159
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:23,878
I'm sorry, Dee, I thought
you were sitting out.

160
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:25,997
Well, I was out, but then
these guys wanted to hear

161
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,333
some impressions, and since I'm
always wanting to be of service,

162
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,552
here I am, uh... They don't
want to hear your impressions.

163
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:31,636
They want to hear my impressions.
No.

164
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:32,620
Your impressions are terrible.

165
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:34,205
Are you out of your mind?
No.

166
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:35,607
My impressions are fantastic.

167
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:37,559
Give me somebody.
Anybody.

168
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:39,043
Do Obama.

169
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,979
Obama?
Well, I can't do that.

170
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,497
- Why not? Yeah.
- Why can't you do Obama?

171
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,149
'Cause he's a black man
and I'm a white woman.

172
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:45,667
Can you give me a white woman?

173
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,252
You think I can't
do a black woman?

174
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I mean...

175
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,320
No.

176
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:50,922
I... okay, give me, name one.

177
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:53,925
C.C.H. Pounder.

178
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,610
Who's that?
C.C.H. Poun...

179
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:56,945
Yeah. The actress
from<i> The Shield.</i>

180
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,029
Love that show.
Okay, yeah.

181
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:58,880
No, I can do that.
Yeah.

182
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,166
Let's see.

183
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:02,867
Goddamn it, Dutch!

184
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:06,287
What other errands do you
have us running for the D.A.?

185
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:07,622
- Wow!
- Holy shit!

186
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,524
That was great!

187
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:10,575
That was spot on!

188
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,776
Thanks, man.
"Spot on"?

189
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:13,511
You don't even know
who she is, Frank.

190
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,180
I just assumed
she's a no-nonsense

191
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:17,549
black broad from the precinct.

192
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:18,766
That's exactly who she is.
That's exactly who she is.

193
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,986
Fine, fine, fine.
I'll do Obama, okay?

194
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:22,987
Okay.

195
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,222
Okay, what do you got?

196
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,690
Hey, yo, what up, son?

197
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,958
What's up wit'
Congress bein' all

198
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,142
up in my ass and shit, brother?

199
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:29,277
Oh!
Oh!

200
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:30,428
- Oh, my God, Dee.
- That is bad!

201
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,596
What are you doing?

202
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:32,931
That was<i> so</i> racist.

203
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,200
- Are you kidding me?!
- Very racist!

204
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,851
Deandra, he is the President
of the United States.

205
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,169
- That's our president.
- Well, hold on a second.

206
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:40,872
Why was that racist,
but what he did was fine?

207
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:43,741
Because that's not what Obama
sounds like, Dee. That's why.

208
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:47,111
Uh... okay, well, you know,
I-I'm just warming up.

209
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,948
Let me, let me try again.
Um...

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,317
Hey, yo,
where my senators at, dawg?

211
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:53,518
Oh!
Oh!

212
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,267
Oi, oi, oi, oi!
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

213
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,194
Welcome to my first ever
dinner party.

214
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:03,414
I'm gonna have lots
of these types of functions

215
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,583
in the future, you know, with
my new lifestyle.

216
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,117
Wow, you're really just diving
right into that, huh?

217
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:09,019
Just, stereotypes and all.

218
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:11,255
Guys, we are gonna have
an imaginary meal. Mmm.

219
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:13,541
I read about this. Yes.

220
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:16,126
If you truly believe it, then it
will make you full. That's true.

221
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:18,295
Okay. Can I have a broad
with me with big tits?

222
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:19,897
No, because that's
gonna force us

223
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,432
to imagine things
that we don't want to imagine.

224
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:22,566
Ah, good point.
So get rid of my dog?

225
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,667
Yeah, no dogs.

226
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,152
Go! Go!
Hey, get out of here!

227
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,171
So kick it.
Get, get, get!

228
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:28,839
Kick it in the skull.
Kick it in the skull.

229
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,074
We do not allow dogs
in our house, right, Dennis?

230
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,125
Wh...? Our house?
Wh-Why's it our house?

231
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,343
Okay, let's get started.

232
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,144
Let me... let me set
the scene: the food.

233
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,263
The menu. Okay, all right. Ooh,
yeah, start with the food.

234
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:37,815
Yeah, yeah, let's get to it.
Okay, all right, here we go.

235
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:39,583
Paint a nice picture for us,
all right? I'm starving.

236
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:40,851
All right, now
you're gonna start

237
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:42,453
with, like, a big
hunk of chicken.

238
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,489
You know, like, boiled and
skinless, or-or whatever.

239
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:47,691
- Huh. Ugh.
- Okay.

240
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,427
And then, um, you're gonna want
brown with the white, right?

241
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:53,531
So, like, maybe, like, um,
some, like, brown rice.

242
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,166
No... no butter
or-or seasoning or...

243
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,301
Really?

244
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:59,069
I want mashed potatoes.

245
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:00,337
No, no mashed potatoes;
that's just empty carbs.

246
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,772
Why can't we just imagine
whatever we want?

247
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:03,123
Because this is my dinner party.

248
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,775
Well, then take us there!
Yeah!

249
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,110
All right! All right, okay.

250
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:07,044
Everybody's got
something to drink.

251
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,978
Is it a milkshake?

252
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:08,896
No!

253
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:10,347
No, not milkshakes.

254
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,765
Gatorade.

255
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:12,983
And it's gonna be

256
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,501
my favorite flavor: blue.

257
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,487
"Blue" is not a flavor.

258
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,422
How am I gonna taste blue?

259
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,574
Well, just imagine
what blue tastes like.

260
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,792
It does... It just
tastes like blue.

261
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,060
Let's just dig in.
Yeah, can we eat?

262
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,028
Yeah, can we eat?

263
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,313
All right.
Yes.

264
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,866
All right.

265
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,068
Mine's kind of tough.

266
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:32,636
D-Did you overcook this?

267
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:34,138
No, I didn't cook it at all.

268
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,623
Y-You...

269
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,658
Spit it out! It's raw!
You're gonna get sick!

270
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,043
Spit it out, man, spit it out!
No, no, don't spit it out!

271
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:41,195
What are you guys doing?
You don't need to spit it out.

272
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,746
For the love of God.

273
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:43,847
Look, just imagine
that it tastes good, okay?

274
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,282
Look at Dennis, see?

275
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:47,651
Oh, I'm not...
I'm not imagining your meal.

276
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,521
No, I'm imagining
a lovely coq au vin.

277
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:52,756
Braised with lardons
and mushrooms.

278
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,141
I want that!
Yeah.

279
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,626
Well, then have it--
it's right in front of you.

280
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:56,877
As is your buxom date, Frank.

281
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:58,178
Ah, come here, baby.

282
00:08:58,264 --> 00:08:59,597
Oh, hey!

283
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,749
She got her foot
in my raw chicken!

284
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,467
Get your hooker's foot out of my
chicken, man! No, no, no, no.

285
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,135
No dates, no coq au vin,
no hookers.

286
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:06,870
Stop ruining this!
We're not ruining this.

287
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,024
What the hell is that?!

288
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:11,508
Oh, this? It's the sound

289
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:12,843
of my blender
cranking milkshakes.

290
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,262
Anybody want one?

291
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,298
- Shit, I'll take a milkshake. Yeah.
- I'll have a milkshake.

292
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,266
I'll take one. That is not
what blenders sound like, Dee.

293
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,951
No! Don't leave my table! Crash!

294
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,386
Hey!
What are you doing?

295
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:25,022
I'm flipping the table!
Smash! Crash! Oh!

296
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,124
Now I'm breaking a plate!
Boom! Smash! Oh, man.

297
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,926
What the hell, dude?!

298
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:30,110
Oh, that was really uncalled for.
That's nice.

299
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,495
Nothing is working, all right?

300
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,696
You know what,
I want you guys to just...

301
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,231
Everybody just be quiet.

302
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,200
Why don't we just try
not talking for a while?

303
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,635
I'm fine with that.
Yeah.

304
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,069
Yeah.

305
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:40,804
Well, that'll be
the first time ever.

306
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:06,764
Shh!
Of course.

307
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,189
Yeah.

308
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,309
Okay.

309
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,321
Okay.

310
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,191
Okay.

311
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,463
Ha!

312
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,301
Well, that was lame.

313
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:45,636
So stupid.
So stu...

314
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,137
I hated that show,<i> Stomp.</i>

315
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,572
Ugh, I hate rhythm.
H-H-Hang on. Hang on.

316
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,840
D-Dee, what was that?

317
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,408
Well, I-I thought
we were all doing,

318
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,676
like, a<i> Stomp</i> thing.

319
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:53,961
That-that bench,
you opened that bench.

320
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,479
What's inside there?

321
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:56,747
Oh. That opens? Yes.

322
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,748
Maybe there's food in there.

323
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,749
Is there food in there?

324
00:10:58,818 --> 00:10:59,883
Uh, no, just...

325
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,568
Just this water gun.

326
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,537
That's not a water gun,
man, that's a flare gun,

327
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,755
which I'll hold onto
for safekeeping.

328
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,523
Uh...

329
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:08,692
Why?

330
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,594
Well, because I'm the most
responsible person.

331
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,513
Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think
any of us should have a gun.

332
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:13,598
Yeah.
Yeah.

333
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,468
Well, one of us does, so...

334
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:18,986
the end.

335
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,471
Charlie, Charlie,
let me have the gun.

336
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:21,839
Back up, Frank.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

337
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,574
Don't come close to me.
Whoa. Charlie, calm down.

338
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,875
"Calm down, Charlie"?

339
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:27,344
We're trapped
on a sinking ship, okay?

340
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:28,746
We're gonna die in here.

341
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,330
I don't know what you guys
are capable of.

342
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,349
I will hold the gun,
thank you very much.

343
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:35,335
Wait a second, Charlie, the...
the boat's not sinking, okay?

344
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,070
It's-it's just stopped.
Right. Right, it's okay.

345
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,906
Everything's gonna be all right

346
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,357
as long as everybody
remains calm.

347
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:41,692
What the hell is that?

348
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,273
Oh, my God!

349
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:49,492
What's going on?

350
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,060
Wh-What was that?

351
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:53,092
Oh, this is bad.

352
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,027
This is really bad.

353
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:56,528
Let's think.

354
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,263
If the room's on its side,

355
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,666
does that mean the boat's
on its side? Or...

356
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,768
Yeah, that's what it means!

357
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:04,637
I don't know how boats
this big work. All right.

358
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,192
Help us!
This is bad!

359
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:12,244
This is very bad!

360
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,979
All right, we got to get up
there and try that door again.

361
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,948
Maybe that lodged
something loose.

362
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,816
Get up there? How are
we supposed to reach?

363
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,652
Oh! What about
a human pyramid?

364
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,587
Yes. Yes, Mac, a
human pyramid.

365
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,022
All right, you and I
will be the bottoms.

366
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,623
Why? 'Cause I'm gay?

367
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,842
Not because
you're gay, dumb-ass!

368
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,777
Because we're the strongest.

369
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:30,262
Damn it. All right,
and, Frank, Charlie,

370
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:31,597
you'll be on us.

371
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,931
And, Dee, you'll be
on the very top.

372
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,566
Okay.
Okay, I'll be a bottom now,

373
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,652
but in real life, just to
be clear, I'm gonna be a top.

374
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:39,521
Okay, fine, when you're having
gay sex, you can be on the top.

375
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,040
But for now we're on the bottom.

376
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,375
Damn it, the door is locked!

377
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:45,361
- We're done for! We're gonna die in here!
- Hey, Frank.

378
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:46,712
Frank, get yourself together!
We're gonna die in here!

379
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,914
Stop losing your shit!
All right, relax!

380
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,516
- Nobody's dying!
- That's right.

381
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:51,767
Just listen to Charlie;
he seems to have

382
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:52,868
his head straight.
Calm down.

383
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,520
'Cause we're already dead.

384
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,372
Come again?

385
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:58,607
I figured it out.

386
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,726
We're dead. We died.

387
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,494
And I don't know
when it happened.

388
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:04,396
It might have... might have
happened on the cruise ship.

389
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,131
It might have happened on
the drive to the cruise ship.

390
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,616
You were going
awful fast, Dennis.

391
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,585
I don't know.

392
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,320
Maybe it happened
weeks ago in the bar,

393
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,039
in some sort of colossal and
awesome event, I would imagine,

394
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,674
but we're dead,
and we're in hell.

395
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,076
We're just being
toyed with here.

396
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:19,545
Or-or m-maybe we're not
in hell yet.

397
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,413
You know,
maybe this is purgatory,

398
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:23,282
and we're on our way
to be judged.

399
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,249
And soon, oh, boy.

400
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,886
Yeah, soon,
we'll really be in hell.

401
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:29,838
Won't that be something.

402
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:31,757
Charlie, calm down.
It's-it's gonna be fine, okay?

403
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:33,692
We can't be freaking out
every five minutes.

404
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:37,596
Now, look, if we work together,
everything's gonna be fine.

405
00:13:37,665 --> 00:13:38,947
We're gonna get out of here.

406
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,400
Nah, we're already dead.

407
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,202
I'll prove it.

408
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,937
No!

409
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,142
Oh, I think he's coming to.

410
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,744
Oh, shit, that hurt.

411
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,579
Oh, easy.

412
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:54,930
Well, I guess that means
we're alive, huh?

413
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:56,715
Yeah, guess we are.
Guess we are, Charlie.

414
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,400
Good, well, then maybe
everything's gonna be okay.

415
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:01,386
Uh, no, pal, we're
in deep shit here.

416
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,688
Oh, shit! Take it easy.
Okay, take it easy.

417
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:03,922
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

418
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,624
It's not good. It's not good.

419
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:06,725
- Oh.
- As long as, um,

420
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:08,894
we're not gonna
get out of here--

421
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,013
and it looks like that's
sort of where this is headed--

422
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:12,664
is it okay if I just
confess something,

423
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,117
get it off my chest
before we die?

424
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,718
That's a good idea.

425
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:18,103
We shouldn't die holding
things in about ourselves.

426
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,204
Go ahead, Dee.

427
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,074
Mac owns a Cowboys jersey.

428
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,719
I saw him wearing it
in the back office.

429
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:24,943
What? Uh... What?!

430
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:26,411
That's a secret, Dee!
What are you...

431
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,047
Don't say it's Romo.
Of course it's Romo!

432
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,282
Who else would it be?
Oh, my God!

433
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,450
I'm sorry.

434
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,055
You don't think
he deserves to be MVP?!

435
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,186
You son of a bitch.
He's constantly overlooked!

436
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,487
You are a traitor!

437
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:36,388
How many Super Bowls
have the Birds won?

438
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:37,389
Oh, shut up!

439
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,625
Go Birds!

440
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,059
Oi, oi, oi!
Okay, you know what?

441
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,111
I've got something
I want to confess.

442
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:45,063
Charlie changes Frank's
prescription on his glasses

443
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,132
to keep Frank dependent on him.

444
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:48,901
Whoa! Why the hell
you blowin' up my spot, man?!

445
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,035
Wow.
Uh, I'm sorry, Frank.

446
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,220
All right, fine.

447
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:52,488
Well, as long as
we're "tattling,"

448
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,139
uh, Dennis ripped
up all the letters

449
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,741
that your dad wrote from prison,

450
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,508
so... you know.

451
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:57,943
What?

452
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:59,144
My dad has been writing?

453
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:00,646
Dennis, is that true?

454
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:02,014
Yeah, man, but you were
just gonna be, like,

455
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,649
talking about it all the time,

456
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,050
and then your dad was probably
gonna come to our house

457
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,935
and, like, try to kill
us or eat our butts.

458
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:09,421
You know? I'm trying to
protect you, dude! And me.

459
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,324
Does he still write?

460
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:15,060
Well, no, pal, 'cause
you never wrote him back.

461
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:19,131
But, hey, if it makes
you feel any better,

462
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,449
I-I read all
those letters,

463
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:22,734
and he never once said
that he loved you.

464
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,286
He just mostly wanted
you to send him,

465
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,822
like, pornographic magazines
and put drugs in your butt hole.

466
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:31,210
I can't believe you're saying...

467
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:33,679
I could've had
a relationship with my dad.

468
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:34,880
But you ruined it.

469
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,366
Normally, I would
attack you, but...

470
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:39,885
I-I don't have any fight left.

471
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,693
Wow.

472
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:48,810
Well, shit, man. I...

473
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:52,297
I... I hurt ya.

474
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,116
I can see that.

475
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,500
And, uh...

476
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:58,487
you know, it was... it was wrong
of me.

477
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,240
Oh, God, I'll tell you...

478
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:04,576
I see how much pain
you're in right now.

479
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:06,311
It's just...

480
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,248
...it's tearing me up inside.

481
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,950
Jesus, Dennis, you're crying.

482
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:13,919
Well, yeah.

483
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:16,321
I mean, you've turned me
into a blubbering fool here,

484
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,757
because I've hurt...

485
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:20,359
not just my friend...

486
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:24,229
...but my brother.

487
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,731
I've hurt my brother.

488
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:29,534
Onion! I just saw it! Onion!

489
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,669
He's got an onion there!
Aw, I knew it!

490
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:32,020
He's got an onion!

491
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:33,488
You are such an asshole.
I...

492
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:34,873
Now I gotta tell you!

493
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,709
I got a confession.

494
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:38,844
What is it, Frank?

495
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:42,314
I was at Chappaquiddick.

496
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:45,183
The girl, Teddy Kennedy,

497
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:48,036
the bridge, the car...

498
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:50,105
I played a major role.

499
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,189
Jesus, Frank,
we're not doing confessions.

500
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,758
We're doing tattling.
Keep up.

501
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,825
You know what?
It's all right, it's okay.

502
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,093
Guys, let's just...

503
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:56,094
let's stop fighting, okay?

504
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,362
No more confessions,

505
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:58,630
no more tattling
on each other, all right?

506
00:16:58,699 --> 00:16:59,598
Look, guys,

507
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,066
let's just try to enjoy

508
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,501
these last moments
we've got together.

509
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,037
Okay? Or these last hours.

510
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:08,607
Or, hell...
it could even be days.

511
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,097
God, we're gonna drown.

512
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,449
I'm too young to drown!

513
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:18,867
We should die
thinking good thoughts.

514
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:20,369
Yeah.
For me,

515
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:21,586
that's Romo connecting
with Dez Bryant.

516
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:22,621
Oh, stop it!
You traitor!

517
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,755
You son of a bitch!

518
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:24,873
Shut your mouth!

519
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,791
Guys, guys, guys, don't fight.

520
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:26,959
Don't fight, come on.

521
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,067
Oh, we're not good people;

522
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:28,944
we can't even die peacefully.

523
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,029
Yeah.

Look, you gotta
get the words right,

529
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,056
otherwise Jesus is gonna know
we're trying to trick him.

530
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,774
Jesus isn't gonna listen to us.

531
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,743
He's just not,
'cause we're bad people.

532
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:47,446
But if he's gonna listen to
anybody, he might listen to Mac.

533
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:49,147
Mac, you've been talking
to him your whole life.

534
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:50,415
Mac...
He knows you!

535
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,684
He doesn't even know who I am.

536
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,884
Save us! Mac, save us.

there is no God.

Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

Okay, okay, okay.

541
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,927
One last shot.

542
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,462
Uh, dear Heavenly Father...

543
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,963
Yeah.

544
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,799
...if you do exist,
and you are listening,

545
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,501
if you could find it
in your heart

546
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,753
to send us a miracle...

547
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,205
Just send us
one miracle, please.

548
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:14,172
One miracle.

549
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,874
Our goose is cooked!

550
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,342
I'm going down.

551
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,478

00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,117

Whatever?!

Whatever?

557
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,993
Unbelievable!

558
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,863
Ah, whatever.

559
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,103
I can't believe
nobody came to save us.

560
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,922
Should we do this?

561
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,073
Let's go be with the gang.

562
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:49,142

and then we all got pulled up.

568
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,985
I mean, it was a miracle.
It was an actual miracle.

569
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,430
Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry,
can I stop...

570
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:02,271
Can you just move
that light a little bit?

571
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:04,006
It's really blasting me right in my face.
Yeah, it's been

572
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,775
blasting us this whole time.
It's kind of blasting all of us.

573
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,026
- Can you move the light, please?
- Just a little bit?

574
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:07,977
Sorry about that.
Oh, wow!

575
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,428
So much better.

576
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,646
Should've said something
earlier.

577
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:11,732
Well, harrowing stuff,

578
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,708
but I think I got
everything I need.

579
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:15,560
Could you mark down
in your report,

580
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:16,995
uh, that I'm not gay? Because I'm not.
What?

581
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:18,864
What do you mean, you're not gay?
Since when?

582
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:20,599
He's gay.
Oh, well, because

583
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,868
God answered my prayers
and saved us.

584
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,803
That means that there is,
of course, a God,

585
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:26,988
and if there is a God,
then in his infinite wisdom,

586
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:28,590
there's no way
he would have made me queer.

587
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:30,225
- Oh.
So I'm-I'm straight.

588
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,810
All righty. Okay. Look, look...

589
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,428
are we gonna get in trouble
because of this accident?

590
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:35,013
Uh, nope, you're good to go.

591
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:36,815
I just needed your report
for my insurance claim.

592
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,017
Insurance claim?
Y-You're not a cop?

593
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,786
Cop?
No, I'm an insurance adjustor.

594
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:43,171
I'm just collecting reports
of people's experiences

595
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:45,273
for insurance purposes.
Oh.

596
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,441
Whew.
I'm so relieved.

597
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:47,993
So, so... are we
gonna get a payout?

598
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:49,243
Well, you might have,

599
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,799
had you not just
admitted to breaking...

600
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,241
several laws.

601
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,485
What? Right, well...
hang on though.

602
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,233
I mean, we got
trapped in a room...

603
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,968
...by a drunk captain
who sunk the ship.

604
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,584
We almost died, man.
Yeah, man. Yeah.

605
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,763
No, no, it wasn't the
captain's fault. He was sober.

606
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:03,532
Well, what happened?
Whose fault was it?

607
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:07,110
Nobody's fault. The ship just hit
a massive wave during the storm.

608
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,561
In the insurance biz,
that is what we call

609
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:10,947
"an act of God."

610
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,961
Well, God is great.

611
