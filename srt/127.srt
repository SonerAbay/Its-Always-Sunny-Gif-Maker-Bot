00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:22,852
Well, somebody's chipper this morning.

9
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:25,071
Oh... you guys were there all this time?

10
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:26,752
I didn't see you.

11
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:27,886
Yeah, we just didn't want to interrupt

12
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,471
your morning routine.

13
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:32,224
Is doing cocaine every
morning your routine, Frank?

14
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:34,393
- Yeah.
- Hey, Frank,

15
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,727
how's Wolf Cola doing?

16
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:36,895
Funny you should ask.

17
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:39,848
I'm selling it to the
Jews in Boca Raton.

18
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:40,983
They're slurping it up

19
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,100
like candy. They're...

20
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:43,602
I'm telling you, they're addicted.

21
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:45,187
If I recall,
Wolf Cola used to just be, like,

22
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:46,822
a money laundering front.

23
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:49,858
Well, it was,
but I'm selling it now by the truckload.

24
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,526
I mean, they can't get enough of it.

25
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:54,746
It's become the official
drink of Boca Raton.

26
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:55,914
Why do you ask?

27
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,666
Well, just 'cause of this.

28
00:00:58,535 --> 00:00:59,701
The group released

29
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:01,203
another video today.

<i>Preliminary investigations</i>

35
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:17,986
have revealed that Wolf
Cola may in fact be

36
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:22,157
an American soda company,
although how and why Boko Haram

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,459
has adopted it as their
official soft drink

38
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,528
is unknown at this time.

39
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,165
We'll keep you updated on
this story as it develops.

40
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,484
Boca Raton, Frank?

41
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,621
Or the official soft
drink of Boko Haram?

42
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:39,074
Whoops.

43
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:04,180
How do you confuse a city in Florida

44
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,015
with a terrorist organization in Africa?

45
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,600
It's an easy misunderstanding.

46
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,102
It is if you're an elderly cokehead,

47
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:11,821
trying to launder money through
a dummy soda corporation.

48
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:13,273
This is bigger than cola, Dee.

49
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:15,024
This is gonna touch
all of Frank's Fluids.

50
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,526
My God, there are other fluids?

51
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,662
Yeah, Wolf Cola, some Nip boba drink...

52
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:20,780
Fight Milk.

53
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,031
- Fight Milk?!
- Fight Milk?!

54
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,032
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, dude, that's our drink.

55
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:24,033
You've been selling that?

56
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,034
It's selling like crazy

57
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,336
with the UFC guys.

58
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,288
- UFC fighters are drinking Fight Milk?
- What?!

59
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:29,289
Buying it like crazy.

60
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:30,540
Oh, my God, Charlie, this is huge.

61
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,342
- Yeah!
- Remember, we designed that

62
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:34,094
for bodyguards, by bodyguards.

63
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,795
And it makes total sense
because the-the best bodyguards

64
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,380
- are former UFC fighters.
- Well, of course.

65
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:38,798
And the best UFC fighters
are former bodyguards,

66
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,049
so bodyguards, UFC fighters,

67
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,434
- that's like...
- It's a revolving door.

68
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:41,903
- Absolutely.
- Of course.

69
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,204
We got to take control of the product.

70
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,687
L-let's get out there.

71
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,022
Let's-let's-let's
mingle with these dudes.

72
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,774
Let's expand the brand, baby.

73
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,007
Fight Milk's back.

74
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,860
- Fight Milk!
- Yeah! Yeah!

75
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,646
Found my go bag.

76
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:54,814
Dee, come over here
and dye my hair blond.

77
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:56,983
- Go bag?
- You're gonna go blond?

78
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,235
Yeah. This is not funny.

79
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,787
Oh, no, it's very funny to me, actually,

80
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:02,322
'cause your life's falling apart.

81
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:03,656
Yeah, you really screwed
yourself this time, Frank.

82
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:04,741
Hey, do you mind?

83
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:05,992
Yeah, go ahead. I'm screwed?

84
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,410
You're going down, too, buddy.

85
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,795
What?

86
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:09,996
Remember when you wanted all the power

87
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:10,997
so you could get the puss?

88
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,248
I made you executive

89
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,501
vice president of
worldwide distribution.

90
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,136
Shit, but nobody knows that, right?

91
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:17,887
I mean, dude,
I only wanted the illusion of power.

92
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:19,055
The-the illusion.

93
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:20,089
I never saw an ounce of puss.

94
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,724
Oh, this is a good day for me.

95
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,643
- You're going down, too? This is great.
- You're laughing?

96
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,728
You're executive vice
president of operations.

97
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:26,784
- Oh.
- What?

98
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:27,385
Yes.

99
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,482
Goddamn it, Frank,
why would you lump me into this?

100
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,401
It's a family business.
I wanted it to be wholesome.

101
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:32,735
- Okay, a-all right, all right.
- Oh, no.

102
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:33,820
- Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.
- Oh, no.

103
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,321
I got this, I got this.

104
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,606
We-we just need to face
this thing head-on.

105
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:38,241
And we need to do it right away, okay?

106
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,493
Because we only have...

107
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,913
...24 hours.

108
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:44,914
This is why we had to wait

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,032
for you to go to Bed Bath & Beyond?

110
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,201
Yes, bitch. Now, listen,

111
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:49,619
we live in the age of
the 24-hour news cycle,

112
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:50,920
which means we only have

113
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:52,338
24 hours to respond to this, okay?

114
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:53,540
If we don't, then Internet trolls

115
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,757
are gonna control the narrative.

116
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,959
I don't know how we're gonna come back

117
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,544
from dealing with terrorists.

118
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,262
Christ, Mercedes built Nazi tanks, okay?

119
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:00,880
And the Jews are still
driving their cars around.

120
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,265
Floyd Mayweather beat the shit

121
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,100
out of multiple women
and he's the highest paid

122
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:05,468
athlete of all time.

123
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:06,769
All right? There's only one thing

124
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,771
you can't come back from...
banging kids.

125
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,273
Well, what about the Catholic Church?

126
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:11,524
Hmm. That's a good point.

127
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:12,642
Yeah, no, they did sidestep

128
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,227
banging kids pretty masterfully,

129
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,862
but they've got billions of
dollars at their disposal

130
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,697
- and we do not, so...
- No.

131
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,115
here we go.

132
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,071
- Fight Milk!
- Fight Milk's in the house.

133
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:26,823
Fight Milk's in the house.

134
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,575
- Who needs some Fight Milk?
- Fight! Fight!

135
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,079
- Fight Milk's in the house.
- That's right.

136
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:34,497
Time to stop eating your crow

137
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:35,832
and start drinking your crow, everybody.

138
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,833
Hey, guys.

139
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:37,967
Turn off that Cancun,

140
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,969
pussy ass, techno bullshit.

141
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,504
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

142
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,972
- I said turn off the...
- That's what I was saying is...

143
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,340
Don't play the c... the...

144
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,592
the Cancun bullshit, Charlie,

145
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:46,893
- and he said...
- I said the same thing, yeah.

146
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,511
Got to go spring break. Well, anyway,

147
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:49,846
- let's tell you about ourselves.
- Yeah.

148
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,598
We're the founders and
creators of Fight Milk.

149
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,099
- Yeah.
- We wanted to come by and tell you

150
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:54,567
a little bit about what we do.

151
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:56,319
- Yeah.
- Now, I've always been very passionate

152
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:57,904
- about dominating other men.
- Uh-oh.

153
00:04:58,023 --> 00:04:59,188
There's nothing like the feeling

154
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:01,190
of another man submitting to your will.

155
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:02,442
Now that's power.

156
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:03,576
- Yeah.
- In a lot of ways, that's love.

157
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:04,527
What are you talking about?

158
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:06,029
Okay, he's a bodyguard, though.

159
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:07,413
- Yeah.
- I feel like you were being unclear.

160
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:08,998
- Did-did I not say that?
- Yeah, you should say...

161
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,283
- you should lead with that.
- I'm screwing up the pitch.

162
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,701
You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.

163
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:13,536
We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts

164
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:14,921
who wanted to take the power

165
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,213
and essence of a crow

166
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,258
and-and we packed that
into a delicious milk drink

167
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,959
- that we invented, thus Fight Milk.
- Yeah.

168
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,011
I don't know what you guys
are talking about right now,

169
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,513
but I have heard of your stuff

170
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,265
and Cerrone and Felder,
they actually love it.

171
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,799
- Are you kidding me, dude?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:28,551
Cowboy Cerrone and Paul
Felder drink Fight Milk?

173
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:29,552
Oh, they love it. They crush it.

174
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:30,720
- They crush it.
- They're crushing...

175
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:31,604
- That's...
- Fight Milk

176
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:32,855
is supposed to be crushed.

177
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,891
Uh, this is for wiping yourself down.

178
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:36,059
- Yeah, yeah, thanks, bro.
- Okay, man.

179
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,060
- All right, yeah, my man.
- All right, thanks, bro.

180
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,061
Yeah, thanks, guys.

181
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,362
- Hey, good luck with that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

182
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,897
- Hello?
- Hello?

183
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:42,398
Uh, Mr. Cowboy, Mr. Felder.

184
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,068
- Oh, Cowboy!
- Hey!

185
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,736
- Oh!
- Oh!

186
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,739
- It's us, the Fight Milk guys.
- Hey.

187
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:51,040
Oh, man, we love your drink.

188
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,408
We just had some.

189
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,410
Yeah, man,
I'd get up and shake your hands

190
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,996
if I wasn't shitting my
brains out right now.

191
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:59,832
- Oh, no.
- No, no, that's fine, yeah.

192
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,168
So, Fight Milk makes you sick?

193
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,470
Makes you expel all body fluids.

194
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,055
Sweat, piss,

195
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:07,473
and shit; we got
these weigh-ins coming up.

196
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,642
Nothing cuts weight like Fight Milk.

197
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:11,644
Oh, you're using it to cut weight, huh?

198
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:13,062
Yeah, they should
give you guys a Nobel...

199
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,484
Oh, I just puked on my dick!

200
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:19,435
Rock and roll.

201
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:20,520
All right, cool.

202
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:21,938
- Well, uh...
- Rock and roll, yeah.

203
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,324
- Yeah.
- We just got you some merch.

204
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,608
Um...

205
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,110
Yeah, water bottle.

206
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,362
For when you feel better, and...

207
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,697
- Um... yeah,
- We should, uh...

208
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:31,948
well, keep drinking the-the drinks

209
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,416
that makes you guys throw up and...

210
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,002
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, God!

211
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,923
All right, you guys ready?
This is our opportunity

212
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,842
to control our message to the public.

213
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,795
And I think how we do that
is soften their brand.

214
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,463
- Whose brand?
- Boko Haram.

215
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,349
- What?
- Wait, stop,

216
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,933
Fr-Frank, you want to change...

217
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,436
the perception of a global
terrorist organization?

218
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:56,139
- Yeah, and I've got many facts to do it.
- No. No, no, no, no.

219
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:58,441
Put your facts away.
We're just here to apologize, bozo.

220
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,109
No, hold on a second, Dee, no.
We're not here

221
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:02,228
to apologize, either, okay?
You never apologize.

222
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,696
We're just here to take responsibility,

223
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:04,981
but for nothing specific.

224
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:06,699
All that matters is that consumers feel

225
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,368
- their voices are being heard.
- No.

226
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,486
You say you're sorry,
and then you just move on.

227
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,071
No, Dee, actually,
<i>you</i> don't say anything.

228
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:13,990
But you do have a very important job...

229
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,908
to say nothing and stand behind me.

230
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,460
You see, audiences are gonna trust me

231
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,495
over you because you're a woman,

232
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:22,048
and, by definition, shrill.

233
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,417
No. Women identify with women in power.

234
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:26,919
Oh, no, Dee.
Women hate other women in power.

235
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:28,337
- I'm threatened by 'em.
- Everyone is.

236
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:31,224
Now, objectify yourself and humanize me.

237
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,059
Hmm.

238
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,398
And here to tell their side of the story

239
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,483
is the team from Wolf Cola.

240
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:41,601
Guys, thanks for coming in.

241
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,236
Oh, well, thank you for having us, Chet.

242
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,738
We at Wolf Cola were
as shocked and saddened

243
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,824
by this news as everyone else.

244
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,909
Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals

245
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,778
as a premium soda company.

246
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,362
We're a family-run business,

247
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,164
and we really care
about people's concerns.

248
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,282
Listen, the point is,

249
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,000
we have heard you all,

250
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:01,204
and we are working tirelessly
to remedy this situation.

251
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:02,422
Well, not an easy situation,

252
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,373
indeed, but handled
with grace and aplomb.

253
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,092
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.
And it looks like

254
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,844
you're already getting good feedback.

255
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:09,429
Oh, that's-that's great.
Well, uh, thank you, Chet.

256
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,264
And I want to say
thank you to America...

257
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,132
And also, we're sorry.

258
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,801
We accept full responsibility

259
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:17,103
for this heinous mistake,
and please know

260
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:19,972
that I am actively firing
people as we speak,

261
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:22,608
because<i> I</i> am the boss.

262
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,227
Bitch.

263
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,145
That's good to know.

264
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:26,979
Yes.

265
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,281
Next up, a heroic tale...

266
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,615
You know what, Chet,

267
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:30,700
can I say something?

268
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:31,784
I think we've said enough.

269
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,035
I think... you got to understand

270
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,121
that Boko Haram did not do 9/11.

271
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,956
- Yeah.
- That was... al-Qaeda.

272
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,241
Paris, that was done

273
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:39,325
by ISIS.

274
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,127
Boko Haram is just concentrating,

275
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:42,879
they're doing Africa. I mean...

276
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,380
I mean, there's mosquitos down there

277
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:48,084
that are bigger terrorists
than Boko Haram.

278
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,055
We're gonna take a break.

279
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:01,740
And the 24-hour news cycle starts again.

280
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:03,191
Way to go, assholes.

281
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,610
- I made good points.
- Jesus Christ,

282
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,495
I am just getting eviscerated online.

283
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,914
People calling me a bitch,
flat-chested bitch,

284
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,116
pretty much everybody
wanting to rape me.

285
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,951
You opened that door the
second you apologized, Dee.

286
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:14,836
You don't see this?
People need an outlet

287
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,588
to unleash their rage. Now social media

288
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,173
will come down on you

289
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,875
with the fury of a middle-aged man

290
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,376
who's accomplished nothing.

291
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,295
- Hi-yo!
- What's up, bitches?

292
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,713
What's that? What do you got?

293
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,715
Huh? Crow traps, baby. Look.

294
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,100
Fight Milk is boomin'. Apparently,

295
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:30,135
people are using it to lose weight.

296
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,771
Yeah. Now, we're gonna lean
into that new market

297
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,523
- and rebrand the product.
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,274
I like this rebranding idea.

299
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:39,061
That's what I got to do...
I got to rebrand my product.

300
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:42,147
You guys, the problem is,
I just ooze sexuality.

301
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:43,115
Well, you ooze.

302
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,399
A real woman of power,

303
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:46,652
she exudes no sexuality at all.

304
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:47,452
That's true.

305
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,003
I think we got to focus
on not losing Boko Haram.

306
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,290
That's a good business.
The fastest-growing marketplace

307
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,326
is Muslim extremists.

308
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,211
Frank, we're not going into
business with terrorists.

309
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,579
Are you crazy?

310
00:09:57,715 --> 00:10:00,048
Look, we need
to get back on TV immediately

311
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,800
and control the goddamn narrative.

312
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,885
Yeah, speaking of TV, we're
gonna be doing a little controlling

313
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,887
of our narrative,
so you guys mind clearing out?

314
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,673
Yeah, this is now our set.

315
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,007
All right, come on,
we got work to do, guys. Let's go.

316
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,392
Let's go. Don't forget your phone,

317
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,560
- stupid idiot.
- Yep.

318
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:17,182
- Three, two, one! What up!
- What up!

319
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:20,435
- Are you fat?
- You probably are, 'cause you're watching TV!

320
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:21,937
Or Internet.

321
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:25,407
Fight Milk! Rebrand!

322
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,996
Let's talk about<i> women's</i> bodies.

323
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,280
I<i> like</i> women.

324
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,832
It's easy for us men... we have four

325
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:35,283
acceptable body types.

326
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,819
<i>Skinny ripped, jack ripped, dad bod,</i>

327
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,588
and fat... if you're funny.

328
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,590
It's a landslide!

329
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,427
As we all know, women only have
one acceptable body type.

330
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,195
<i>Skinny, big tits!</i>

331
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,214
<i>New evidence is suggesting
that all this science</i>

332
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,682
<i>inside one crow's egg</i>

333
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,769
can scientifically make
your breasts larger.

334
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,638
Watch the enzymes
enlargify your breasts.

335
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,808
Want to hear more about it? The sci...

336
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:00,942
Aah!

337
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,311
No nerds! Fight Milk!

338
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:05,397
Finally there's a crow-based

339
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,282
protein alcoholic drink for<i> you.</i>

340
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,984
Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

341
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,656
- Well, what do you guys think?
- I don't get it.

342
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,074
That's 'cause you're a stupid ring girl.

343
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,409
- It couldn't be any simpler.
- Yeah, look,

344
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:19,211
take it easy. Basically, we're trying

345
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,379
to expand our product to
the world of UFC women,

346
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,715
and look, uh,
ring girls are the perfect combo.

347
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,250
- Really.
- Yeah. I mean, honestly, ladies,

348
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:27,085
you could afford to lose a<i> few</i> pounds,

349
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,253
maybe in this area...

350
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:30,589
- Well...
- or here.

351
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,141
Really, I mean, between the three
of you, we could be opening up

352
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,893
a bakery with all the
muffin tops I'm seeing.

353
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,344
- Yes.
- Now, Fight Milk will help you

354
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,846
lose those unwanted pounds

355
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,681
so you don't have to resort to surgery,

356
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:41,767
which could cause scarring and
make you even less attractive

357
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:43,852
- to men than you already are, okay?
- All right.

358
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,187
- Now, I feel like...
- No, no, look, I'm sorry,

359
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:46,905
my friend has really weird women issues.

360
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,657
I didn't realize he
brought a laser pointer.

361
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,193
But the point is,
you guys could look even better

362
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,661
if you drank Fight Milk.

363
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,530
We're not into your
weird diarrhea drink.

364
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,249
Right. Okay, it's not a diarrhea drink.

365
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,834
- It's...
- You know what, Charlie?

366
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,418
This isn't the dream that
I had for Fight Milk.

367
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,420
No! We're not the diarrhea guys.

368
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,256
- No!
- That's not what I want to be.

369
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:06,424
It's not for women!
It was never made for women!

370
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,627
But it'd be great if
women also drank it.

371
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,679
The dream was to create
a muscle-up energy drink

372
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,265
- Yeah.
- that gave you the power to fight like a crow!

373
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,766
- Yes!
- Men!

374
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,434
Or women. But yes. But definitely

375
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,386
- crow-power fighting skills.
- Either way,

376
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:21,306
- Absolutely.
- I think, dude, we got to get back to the lab.

377
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,608
I think we got to get some more crows.

378
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,898
From dog fighting to
finding a loving home.

379
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,733
Amazing.

380
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,985
Now, who wouldn't want to
adopt a little guy like this?

381
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,371
Well said, Mike.

382
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,990
Great story.

383
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:42,494
Now a local soda company
is back in hot water

384
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,830
with controversial remarks.

385
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:48,416
Returning to talk about it today
is the team from Wolf Cola.

386
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:51,503
Thank you so much for having us back,
Chet. Um,

387
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,222
we at Wolf Cola are not just
about making a satisfying soda.

388
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,808
We are about making satisfied customers.

389
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:58,560
We do acknowledge consumers' concerns.

390
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,979
Yes, but we are not apologizing.

391
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,349
- Right. Oh.
- Sorry.

392
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,351
I'm just here to humanize him.

393
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:07,769
- To support me.
- To-to support him.

394
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:09,187
Support me.

395
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:12,357
Uh, Chet, we would also like to announce

396
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:14,242
that for every can of Wolf Cola sold,

397
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,912
a portion of the proceeds
will be going to a charity

398
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,530
that supports African people.

399
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,998
All Africans,

400
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:22,033
even the... our friends at Boko Haram,

401
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,169
because they are people, too.

402
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:26,254
- We don't discriminate.
- Okay, right.

403
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,789
Uh, yeah, look, Chet, if I may

404
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,124
address the public directly?

405
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,375
- By all means.
- Okay.

406
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,793
Um, I assure you

407
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,378
that we have righted this ship,

408
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,430
and we are taking every step necessary

409
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,215
to address all of your concerns.

410
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,351
We at Wolf Cola hope to be a part

411
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,686
of your family's daily
refreshment for years to come.

412
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:45,799
And we can say that
without saying I'm sorry.

413
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:46,942
Well, Mr. Reynolds,

414
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,027
it sounds like Wolf Cola
has the right man in charge.

415
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,062
Yeah. Well, I appreciate that.

416
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:52,864
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.

417
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:54,399
I thought we were done
with the dog segment.

418
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,067
- What the hell's this?
- Oh. Looks like we got

419
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,819
a lovable little guy
loose in the studio here.

420
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:59,371
Yeah. Can we get him out of here?

421
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:00,789
- Great. Thanks.
- Not a dog

422
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,073
- lover, Mr. Reynolds?
- Yeah.

423
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,541
Well, if you're asking me

424
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,243
if I like wild animals
slobbering all over me,

425
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:06,711
then, yeah, I guess I'm not really a...

426
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,380
- not really a dog lover then.
- Wow. I have

427
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,382
never met a person who
does not like dogs before.

428
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,883
Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,668
There are plenty of us out there,

430
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:16,087
uh, Chet. Okay, trust me.
We're just afraid to admit it

431
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,723
because we feel like we're gonna
be judged by people like you.

432
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,259
- Well, let's take a break.
- You know what? Actually, I'm not done.

433
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:24,179
- Uh, Chet, are you a vegetarian by any chance?
- No.

434
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:25,597
Oh, so you're a hypocrite. Yeah.

435
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,065
See, I find that
most people that are whining

436
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:28,934
about dog fights are
actually the same people

437
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,685
going to football games and UFC fights,

438
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,737
watching human beings
beat the ever-loving shit

439
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,773
out of each other while eating,
uh, fried chicken.

440
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:37,442
So, wait. Are you saying you're
an animal rights activist?

441
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,244
No, I'm actually the opposite, pal.

442
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,413
I can't imagine a bigger waste
of peoples' time and energy.

443
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,914
I mean, Chet,
if you can eat fried chicken, then

444
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,532
I should be able to
eat me some fried dog.

445
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,251
Know what I'm saying?
I should be able to eat a bucket

446
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,702
of fried dog at a chicken fight.

447
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,587
Yeah. All I'm saying is,

448
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:53,008
look, let's just, you know,
let's be consistent.

449
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,374
How you feeling, boys?
You've been pounding

450
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,326
- that new formula?
- Yeah, I see you doing it.

451
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,711
Yeah, and we're not doing so good,
asshole,

452
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:13,129
'cause nothing's coming out of me.

453
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:15,415
My trash can's empty.

454
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,715
Yeah, we're scared to shit
we ain't gonna make weight.

455
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,416
- Oh, guys.
- Guys, just don't worry.

456
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,002
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
- No, guys, guys, guys.

457
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,420
Don't worry.
Okay, look, this is all a part

458
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:21,971
of our two-step process, all right?

459
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,339
See, right now, you're crow loading...

460
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,724
Yeah, you drank about, like,

461
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,342
four or five entire crows

462
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,178
'cause I'm grinding one up for
every bottle at this point.

463
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,146
Yes, and it is that crow
enzyme that's jacking you up,

464
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:32,600
and that's why you look
so beefy and so handsome.

465
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,767
And... All right, but then what's
gonna happen is, you start drinking

466
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,236
the Fight Milk Classic, right,

467
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,820
and-and that's gonna
make you really sick,

468
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:39,239
'cause that's just the crow eggs

469
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,657
and some of the crow's fecal matter.

470
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,075
So you start to puke everything out,

471
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,610
and then you'll be
fine for the weigh-in.

472
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:45,445
You're gonna be puking
on your dick in no time.

473
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,163
Yeah, yeah, that one's real nasty.
Don't worry about it.

474
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:48,581
- Yeah.
- You're gonna make weight at the weigh-in.

475
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah, all I know is,
we don't make weight,

476
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:51,751
I'm killing you both.

477
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,754
Yeah.

478
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,039
- All right.
- Uh, that's fine.

479
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,790
We're gonna be... We're good.

480
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,292
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right, guys, hey, go... go kick ass.

481
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:02,045
Remember, that's the nasty one.
Drink that one.

482
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,846
That one's got a real...

483
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,933
All right,

484
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:09,519
let's bring out the first fighter,
Cub Swanson.

485
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:15,942
- We got to get him on Fight Milk, man.
- Oh, yeah, we got to get him.

486
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,644
We got to get him.
We got to get him drinking it.

487
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,614
Up next, the challenger,
Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone.

488
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,567
Come on!

489
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:25,881
Yes!

490
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,742
This is it. If he makes weight,

491
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,078
this is gonna change Fight
Milk and our lives forever.

492
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,913
I know, but if he doesn't,
we're bolting, right?

493
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:38,748
Oh, yeah. I've already
scoped out every single exit.

494
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,166
155.

495
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:42,752
Yes!

496
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,337
Yeah. We did it!

497
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,755
- We're gonna be rich!
- We did it! We're gonna be rich!

498
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,473
- We're gonna be rich.
- Let's go.

499
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,175
All right, Cowboy,
how you feeling right now?

500
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,594
I'm feeling good. Ready to put
on a show for all these guys.

501
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:56,182
What the hell is going on?
Who are these guys?

502
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,434
Uh, just like to take the
opportunity to thank Fight Milk.

503
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,487
Yes, and thank you, Cowboy,
and thank you, Megan.

504
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:02,939
We'd also like to take this opportunity

505
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:04,440
to announce that Fight Milk is now

506
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,192
- the official drink of the UFC.
- Official drink.

507
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:07,610
Now if you're in...

508
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:08,710
No, no.

509
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,830
This is not the official
drink of the UFC.

510
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,615
And I don't know who these guys are.

511
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:15,451
- Security, get these assholes out of here!
- Fight Milk!

512
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,919
Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

513
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,706
Fight Milk! Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

514
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,591
Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

515
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,551
The nationwide hatred for Wolf Cola

516
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:27,687
continues to intensify
on an hourly basis...

517
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:30,557
Holy shit. We're getting hammered
worse than before.

518
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,892
Bye-bye, Frank's Fluids.

519
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:34,894
Turns out there are<i> two</i> things
that can't be forgiven...

520
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,729
raping children and disliking dogs.

521
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:39,649
Well, what am I gonna
do with all the merchandise, man?

522
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,734
Throw it in the garbage, burn it.
Who gives a shit.

523
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,653
Yeah, we're done.
Fight Milk shit the bed.

524
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:46,122
- What happened?
- Breaking news

525
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,373
from the sports world.

526
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:48,658
Fighters at a UFC

527
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:51,077
event in Philly tested positive

528
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,246
for several banned substances,

529
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:56,583
stemming from an energy
drink called Fight Milk.

530
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:58,350
We pumped it full of human
growth hormone, you know.

531
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:58,951
Yeah.

532
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,587
I mean, just nothing else was working.

533
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:02,388
It just... it was just
giving people diarrhea.

534
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:03,556
- Mm.
- Ugh.

535
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,974
Starting to become known

536
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,809
as the official drink of the UFC,

537
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,596
this Fight Milk is a serious
smudge for the group,

538
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:13,233
and a potential public
relations nightmare.

539
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,851
- Ooh.
- Holy shit. Holy shit.

540
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,436
- What?
- You guys, this is good.

541
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,188
This is good.
We're freed, and they are screwed.

542
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:19,739
See, this is actually the one<i> good</i> thing

543
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:21,524
about the 24-hour news cycle.

544
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,910
If you give it enough time,
something new will come along

545
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:26,579
to replace peoples'
old outrage with new outrage.

546
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:28,198
Not much is known about Fight Milk,

547
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,583
except that it's made
right here in Philadelphia

548
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,419
by a parent company
known as Frank's Fluids.

549
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:36,005
<i>Goddamn</i> it!

550
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,175
Start the clock.

551
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:40,510
Yeah.

552
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:43,797
