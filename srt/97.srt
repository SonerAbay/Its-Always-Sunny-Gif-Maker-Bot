1
00:00:02,106 --> 00:00:04,863
So sign up for the
Invigaron system today, and take

2
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:07,136
the first steps toward obtaining
financial freedom.

3
00:00:07,138 --> 00:00:10,673
Invigaron-- a business
opportunity as rare as the

4
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:15,645
- albani berries themselves.
- What's happening?

5
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:18,014
You're, like, a berry salesman
now or...?

6
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:20,216
No, I'm a distributor,
Charlie, for a revolutionary new

7
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:22,318
- product that changes lives.
- Right. Now explain

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,955
these to me. Oh, those are my new wrenches.
I got those free for sitting

9
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:27,523
through a 20-minute
presentation.

10
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:30,093
Oh, I get it now.
It's a scam.

11
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,662
No, no, no, no, no,
it's not a scam at all.

12
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,998
I also had reservations in the
beginning, but these super

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,133
berries grow in the Andes
mountains, okay?

14
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,736
Alpacas can survive entire
winters on this shit.

15
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:42,572
Oh, shit! So it's like a
super berry, huh?

16
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,274
Mm-hmm.
Now what kind of superpowers

17
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:47,310
are you talking about? Like, do you
survive the winter? Great question.

18
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:49,078
So is that the only super
power you get, surviving

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,580
winters?
Because I've survived many

20
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,982
winters without these berries.
No, I think I have an answer

21
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:54,450
for all of this stuff, okay?
Okay.

22
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,785
Charlie, allow me
to demonstrate.

23
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,787
Oh, you got a thing here.
Come over here and hold

24
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,956
on to these.
Now, this machine is gonna

25
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,225
measure the level of toxins
in your body caused by stress.

26
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:04,093
All right. Where do I put
my feet?

27
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,062
Wherever you want.
I'm gonna put them on

28
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,164
the stool.
Great. It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:13,770
Okay, here we go.
120, 140, 157.

30
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:17,173
Oh, shit, Charlie. 157?

31
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,409
Is that bad?
Yeah, it's not good.

32
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,544
Guys, I got 157.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

33
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:25,615
157 what?
Units.

34
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:27,717
Units, dude.
Units of what?

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,319
Units of stress!
Ah!

36
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,787
You're very, very high
in your...

37
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,422
That's a lot of units!
...in your stress unit.

38
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,157
But don't even worry, because
Invigaron can help you.

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,392
These berries are chock-full
of antioxidants and

40
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:37,894
phytonutrients.
Oh, thank God.

41
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,996
All right, I'm sold. I'm in.
Of course you're buying it,

42
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:42,065
because you're as big of an
idiot as she is.

43
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,500
You're getting scammed, Dee!
It's not a scam!

44
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:46,736
You walked into a room that
you could have walked out of

45
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:49,839
with a free set of golf club
but instead you got got.

46
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:53,009
Hey, I say we get ourselves
a new pair of golf clubs, huh?

47
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,777
Yeah, well, we won't get got
though.

48
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:59,215
We gonna get. See, Dee, people like
us, we don't get got. We go get.

49
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:03,386
That's right. You won't see us getting scammed.
No way.

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:23,749

51
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,885
Hey-oh! All right, Charlie, I
signed you up for the gold

52
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:31,986
member starter kit, okay?

53
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:32,654
Good. Yeah.

54
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:33,318
Yeah. You know what's
in here?

55
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:36,558
Two cases of the juice, four
packs of the energy gel.

56
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,559
Nice.

57
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,195
There's a box of shake mix,
and I think they threw in a

58
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:41,496
bunch of protein...
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

59
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,365
What are you doing, Charlie?!

60
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,100
What?
What are you doing?!

61
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:47,202
I'm drinking the berry juice
to save my life.

62
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:48,803
This is not about berries,
all right?

63
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,473
You sell it. This is a whole
moneymaking system, okay?

64
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,242
That's what Invigaron is.
It's-it's about money,

65
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:58,413
and it's about, you know,
"wealth creation through-through

66
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,982
the use of antioxidants,
powerful antioxidants."

67
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:03,017
Yeah, uh-huh.
And, you know, we're going

68
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,786
to "redefine success and-and
change the world."

69
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:06,755
You know what?
All those words are, like,

70
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:08,690
stressing me out, Dee.
And I can't get more str...

71
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,792
I'm at 157!
I'm gonna be honest.

72
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:13,228
I'm a little confused as well.
Uh, I don't have a firm grasp

73
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,729
on exactly how this...
It's confusing stuff.

74
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,464
Where the hell is Frank?
Where the hell is Frank?

75
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,233
He can help us.
He's, like, a business genius.

76
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,968
I don't know where he is.
He didn't come home this

77
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,436
morning.
He took off last night.

78
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:22,971
He said he had some dream
or something.

79
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:24,973
And, like, he woke up, he's
like, "Ah, Charlie, I got to

80
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,808
get to the playground."
And he shot out of here.

81
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,410
Why is he at the playground?
I don't know.

82
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:30,178
He told me not to come.
Well, we got to go

83
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,813
figure it out.
He can help explain all this.

84
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:33,381
Yeah, he's good with stuff
like this.

85
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:34,716
We're not.
All right, all right,

86
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,251
let's do it.
I'm drinking this one though.

87
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:39,921
Yeah, but don't open any more.

88
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:41,756
Frank?
Huh?

89
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:44,092
What is this? You're stuck?
Was this your plan?

90
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,127
No.
What is this?

91
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,896
How did this happen?
How does anything happen,

92
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,264
Charlie?
Move past it, will ya?

93
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,865
I'm afraid that's going
to be impossible.

94
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,534
Yeah. Where are your clothes?
Why are you naked and stuck

95
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,269
in a coil?
Just get me out of here.

96
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,737
All right, well, first
we should do the

97
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,539
thing because..
Yeah. Charlie and I have

98
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,674
a couple of business questions
we wanted to ask you first.

99
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,242
What? Deandra, don't
dick around.

100
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:03,545
Get me out of here!
Look, I'll be quick, okay?

101
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,880
Now, Charlie and I have recently
come into a rare business

102
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:08,149
opportunity, and we were hoping
you could clear a couple things

103
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:11,052
up for us.
Can you look at that?

104
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:14,155
It's a pyramid scheme.
It's not a pyramid scheme.

105
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:19,661
It's a reverse funnel system.
Turn it upside down.

106
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:21,796
Oh, shit!
Goddamn it! Shit!

107
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:23,565
All right, you've been duped,
suckers.

108
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,467
You're the sucker, okay?
You're naked and you're stuck

109
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,336
in a coil! All right, calm down, calm down.
Look, Frank is there any way,

110
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:30,071
you know, to get out of one
of these schemes?

111
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,273
All right, what you got to do
is round up a couple of suckers

112
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,075
and get 'em hooked.
Dummies with deep pockets

113
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,845
are the best.
What about Ben the Soldier?

114
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,480
Well, he's as dumb as
you can get.

115
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:41,216
Yeah. He's dumb as bricks, that guy.
He's so stupid.

116
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:42,717
All right, let's do it.
That's good.

117
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,652
We'll get him, and I'll get,
like, a pulley or a rope, and

118
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,521
we'll just yank you out of there
or something, all right?

119
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:48,223
Get me out of here.
Yeah. Hold on, hold on.

120
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:50,391
Charlie, whoa, think about this.
If we get him out of there,

121
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:52,026
how do we know he's gonna keep
helping us?

122
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:53,761
Well, what do you mean?
If we get him out of there,

123
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:55,196
he might scam us further.
We don't know.

124
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:57,065
He's a business mastermind.
I don't know what he's got

125
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,633
going on.
Shit, that's a good point.

126
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,235
I mean, what's he doing
in that coil, you know

127
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:01,936
what I mean? He wouldn't say.
He could be up to something.

128
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:04,005
I say we leave him stuck in
there just for a few more days

129
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,673
so we can leverage him for
business advice...

130
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,242
Right. We keep him contained.
That's right.

131
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:08,676
If we need questions,
we just go to him.

132
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,078
That's right.
All right, all right.

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,046
Hey, uh, Frank, we'll be
back in a couple days to help

134
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,481
you out, okay, buddy?
No, no, no, no!

135
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:14,916
Deandra, I don't have a
couple of days!

136
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,952
It's Saturday coming up.
There's gonna be kids here!

137
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:26,060
Hey, guys.
You here for the presentation?

138
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,595
I'm Harris Marder.
Save it, bozo.

139
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:29,163
We're here for the free
golf clubs.

140
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,099
You got exactly 20 minutes
to do your little song

141
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,834
and dance.
We're just gonna tune out, so

142
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:34,769
why don't you give us a wave
when you're finished.

143
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:36,304
Or don't.
What's the point?

144
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:38,273
I'd just be wasting my time.
I mean, obviously,

145
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:41,843
you two are smart. 19 minutes and 50
seconds, clown. Don't get me wrong.

146
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,212
Invigaron is great, but you got
to put in the hours.

147
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:46,214
You fellows strike me more as
men of leisure.

148
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,982
Obviously.

149
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:50,251
Well, we are.
Yeah, I mean, this guy's got

150
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,086
the Hawaiian shirt, you with
the killer tan.

151
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:54,856
Bet it's killing you guys
to be stuck indoors on a

152
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,958
beautiful day like today.
It is. So less yapping,

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,561
more golf clubs please.

154
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,662
Yeah, I get it.
And you know what?

155
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:03,264
Because you guys are such great
sports, I'm gonna throw in a

156
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:06,267
coupon for a free round of golf
at the Dusty Dunes Resort

157
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,803
in Orlando.
You guys been to Florida?

158
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:12,440
Been there? Not physically.
If you want, I can set you

159
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:15,009
up with one of their private
villas.

160
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:18,413
Private villa.
Whatever. That's pretty nice.

161
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,114
Look at that.
Oh, it is nice.

162
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,684
Did you know that the average
rate for a hotel room 30 years

163
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,687
ago was $19?
Today it's $237.

164
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,257
That's a 1,300% increase.
So it's not inconceivable to

165
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,527
think that in another 30 years,
a week at a hotel runs you

166
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,796
20 grand.
That's not inconceivable.

167
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:37,732
That's... crazy. That's very,
very conceivable. Really?

168
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:41,069
Okay, but not for you guys.
You'll be locked in at $1,400

169
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:44,238
annually.
Wait. We would be?

170
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,674
Yeah. I'm not talking about
taking a vacation, guys.

171
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,277
I'm talking about owning
a vacation.

172
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,746
And, look, if you're still not
comfortable with the numbers,

173
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,982
you just double down.
You get two weeks, sell

174
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,552
that second week, boom, you're
vacationing for free.

175
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:59,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

176
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,789
Mac, I think this guy just bent
himself over a barrel

177
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,157
a little bit.
He did?

178
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,093
Yeah, for our pleasure.
Follow me here.

179
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:07,996
Okay, so if we buy a second
week, and we sell that, we're

180
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:09,631
vacationing for free.
What happens if we buy

181
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,767
a third week and sell that?
We're getting paid

182
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,135
to vacation!

183
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,703
Oh, shit!
You guys, I... I've actually

184
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:17,405
never thought of it like that.
I know!

185
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,173
I'm not sure I can make that
deal.

186
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:20,808
The deal's locked in.
Deal's done.

187
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,543
I'm gonna write in "three..."
Write in "three weeks."

188
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,312
Three here... that's done!
Yeah, right?

189
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:25,913
Put three on...
You got got!

190
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:27,582
You thought we were a bunch of
suckers, but guess what?

191
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,217
Oh, God.
We're not.

192
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:30,818
We just bought three weeks of a
time-share.

193
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,754
So you did.

194
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,290
Not a great turnout.

195
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,460
No, not-not a great turnout.
You know why?

196
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,128
Nobody gives a shit about free
soup, Charlie.

197
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,696
People want golf clubs and
concert tickets.

198
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,565
Don't knock the soup, all
right? Da'Maniac's here.

199
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,300
He's sucked down, like, three
bowls of it.

200
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,935
Yeah, he is here.
And why is he here, Charlie?

201
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,670
Well...
Nobody wants to buy something

202
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,305
from a deranged wrestler.
Why would you invite him?

203
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,940
I didn't invite him.
He just drifted in.

204
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,575
I guess he was...
Just looking for soup.

205
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,176
...looking for free soup,
yeah, free soup.

206
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,811
All right.
You know, drifters...

207
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,546
All right, let's just get it
going, all right?

208
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,215
Yeah. Hello, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming

209
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,850
today.
Each one of you has been

210
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,520
hand-selected to potentially
join our Invigaron team.

211
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,023
"What is Invigaron?" you may be
asking.

212
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,558
Charlie?

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,694
Hello, everyone.
I'm Dee, and this is Charlie.

214
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:20,197
And as you can tell by our
huge mansion, we're insanely

215
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,302
loaded. But it wasn't always this way.
We used to be losers, like all

216
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:28,239
of you people. And then we discovered
the Invig...

217
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,276
Invigaron!
And it all starts with the

218
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,747
berries. The berries are the most delici...
I'm sure you're all excited

219
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,516
to learn more about the
Invigaron system.

220
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,318
What the hell happened to my
part, Dee?

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,953
Yeah, I had to do some
reshoots.

222
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,587
You are way too hung up on the
berries.

223
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,290
The success of the Invigaron
system is largely due to the

224
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,093
simplicity of its origins.
Using a multi-tiered

225
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,895
distribu...
...multi-level market...

226
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,997
...the Invigaron system...
...multi-level...

227
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,966
Invig...

228
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,201
I'm Andy, proud owner of my
own mountain, where...

229
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,071
Did a couple reshoots of my own.

230
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,808
Proud owner of my own mountain,
where I'm a magical bean farmer.

231
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:10,314
Berries!♪

232
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,383
Does the sophisticated
business model of Invigaron

233
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,019
confuse you?
You don't need to understand how

234
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,656
Invigaron works, because
somebody above you does.

235
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:24,662
So ask less questions, and make
more money.

236
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,464
There we go.
Okay.

237
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,165
Well, I wasn't quite
finished, there's...

238
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,168
Still not convinced?
Well, guess what?

239
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,873
The Invigaron system is also a
pyramid scheme.

240
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,442
"What's a pyramid scheme?" you

241
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,344
ask.
All right, basically a house

242
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,413
of cards where the dickheads at
the bottom do all the work, and

243
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,548
give all the money to the smart
guys up at the top.

244
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,753
All right? Now, will you get... Don't
just be successful. Be berry...

245
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,289
You won't need a pot of gold.
But still amazingly badass...

246
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,694
So do...

247
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,329
There we go.
All right, any questions?

248
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,432
I have a question.
Uh, how do I get in on this?

249
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,101
Uh, you probably don't,
because you need money.

250
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,203
Ben, how many boxes am I gonna
put you down for?

251
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,972
I don't really understand
what I'm buying.

252
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,573
You saw the video.
Was the video not clear?

253
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,308
The video was pretty clear,
Charlie.

254
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,010
You think maybe it's your
stress?

255
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,645
Do you want to check your
photon levels?

256
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,280
Oh. Yes.
Yeah.

257
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,948
Yeah, you could be stressed.
It... okay.

258
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,683
Here you go.
Okay.

259
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,752
Uh, where should I put my feet?
Dee, where do his feet go?

260
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,754
The feet go wherever.
What is it with the feet?

261
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,389
Thank you for this business

262
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,958
opportunity.
I will not let you down.

263
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,794
No, no, no, no, no.
Sir, you need to pay for the

264
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,562
product, you can't just take it
out of here.

265
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,197
Roger!
Roger that.

266
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,965
He's just... he's just
leaving the bar.

267
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,936
He just stole the berries. That's not g...
 Oh!

268
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,538
Oh, 107.
Hey, man, that's pretty good.

269
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:44,291
What? Don't...

270
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,092
Healthy guy over here.
Charlie, no, that's terrible.

271
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,994
He's very stressed out and he
needs to buy the product and eat

272
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,629
the berries.
Oh, shit!

273
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:54,000
I-I'm sorry. Um, I don't think this is for me.
Oh, goddamn it!

274
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:56,169
If 107's bad, I got to eat
more berries.

275
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:59,839
Stop eating berries!
You've had enough berries!

276
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:04,611
I just don't understand.

277
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,947
Is it a sexual thing?
No, just get me the hell out!

278
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,882
It doesn't matter!
Matters to me; I don't

279
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,917
think I can move past it.
We came here for a reason.

280
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,686
Let's just jump into it, all
right?

281
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,321
All right.
Frank, we have a very

282
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,679
exciting real estate opportunity for
you in sunny Orlando, Florida. Yes.

283
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,659
How would you like to spend one
week out of the year living the

284
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:23,597
high life at your own private
villa at the Dusty Dunes Resort?

285
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,432
You guys bought a time-share?
Well, yeah.

286
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,735
Yeah. How can you all be so gullible?
No, no, no, no.

287
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:30,403
No, this is different, Frank.
This is different.

288
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,138
Tell him.
This asshole tried to sell us

289
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,307
one week.
We took the prick for three.

290
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:37,327
You did?
You took him for three weeks?

291
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,809
Dennis thought of it.
You think he didn't want to

292
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,294
sell you as many weeks as
possible?

293
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:42,698
No, I don't think he...
I told you that might have

294
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:43,827
been a concern, I...
No, I know, but I...

295
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,043
The whole way over, you said
that's...

296
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,933
All right, fine.
Well, look, I didn't come here

297
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,668
to be criticized by a man stuck
in a coil!

298
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,437
Are you gonna buy a week or not?
No, I'm not that stupid.

299
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,138
We don't need this.
We're out of here, Frank.

300
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,873
Screw you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

301
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,508
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I-I-I can help you.

302
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,143
Yeah?
I can help you. Yeah.

303
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:58,945
Help us how?
I'll give you a premium lead

304
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:00,580
on a deep-pocket dummy.
Premium lead?

305
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:02,215
That's business talk.
We need premium leads.

306
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:05,552
Yeah. Who? You promise to get me out of here?
Yeah, yeah, Frank, we

307
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:06,440
promise.
What do you think, we're

308
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,466
gonna leave you in a coil?
Give us a name.

309
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:10,034
Ben the Soldier.
All right?

310
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,959
Ben the Soldier, huh?
Yeah.

311
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:13,917
Well, yeah...
That's pretty good.

312
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:14,885
It is?
Yeah.

313
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,640
He's very, very dumb.
I mean, think about it.

314
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,442
He went over there, probably
saw some pretty serious carnage.

315
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:21,679
He's gonna have some bad PTSD.
If we trigger that, he'll be

316
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,848
putty in our hands.
Right, whatever.

317
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,483
Okay, get me out of here.
No.

318
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,118
Nah. Nah.
Nah.

319
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,753
No.

320
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:32,193
Wait, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
You just got got, Frank.

321
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:33,945
Yeah.
Uh, you played your hand a

322
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,714
little too early, sucker.
We'll come back when we need

323
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,382
you again.
That's called leverage.

324
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:38,984
Right.
That's business talk.

325
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:39,664
Yeah, thought you were good
at that stuff.

326
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,227
The kids are coming! What...
I know.

327
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:45,057
The kids!
The kids will be here!

328
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,063
Now listen.

329
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,118
We just need to trigger his PTSD
a little bit, all right?

330
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,820
Get him all jumbled up.
Couple of sudden movements.

331
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,522
Loud noises.
Exactly.

332
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,157
Hey!
Hey!

333
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,925
Ben!
It's so good to see you, man.

334
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,560
How are you?
Come on in.

335
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,228
Have a seat on the couch, why
don't you?

336
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,863
Okay.
All right.

337
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,132
Oh, my God!
Hi.

338
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,001
Da'Maniac.
Yeah, I know.

339
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,769
What are you doing here?
Well, I've come for the

340
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,604
presentation.
Gonna be really cool, huh?

341
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,040
Oh, it's... it's sort of...
geared specifically towards Ben,

342
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,209
so...
I like him, too.

343
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,844
He a good guy, huh?
Nice to see you.

344
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,479
Yeah.
That's good.

345
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,147
He's coming in.
Hey, Ben.

346
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,949
How you doing?
All right, let's just, uh...

347
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,352
Okay, uh...
All right, listen, so, Ben...

348
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:27,355
Um, we would like to offer you a

349
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:30,958
week's stay in our time-share
condominium in Florida.

350
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,994
It's an amazing property.
I mean, when we first saw it, we

351
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,963
were like, "Boom!"

352
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:46,674
Sometimes, loud noises make

353
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,744
the squirrels go in my head, and
I-I don't fight in the ring

354
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:55,750
anymore, but I still fight with
the demons in Da'Maniac's head.

355
00:13:55,752 --> 00:14:00,588
All right, well, we'll-we'll
try to be a little bit more

356
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,923
sensitive to that.
I... Yeah.

357
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,226
Um, and we'll keep our voices
down from here on out.

358
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:09,964
Yeah. Uh, Ben, should we talk numbers?
Oh, I don't know.

359
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:13,434
Um, and it sounds really nice,
but I'm not trying to make any

360
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:17,171
business decisions.
I have a 107 stress level.

361
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,507
Ooh.
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,909
I shouldn't be here.
I-I have to go.

363
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,278
Well, wait, Ben, stop. Ben...
Don't go, Ben.

364
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,614
No, the sunshine state.

365
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,949
Oh, uh, I'm in.

366
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:33,687
Oh, no. Well, no. See, Maniac, it's
very expensive. It's, like, $1,400.

367
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,856
Sold to the Maniac for $1,400.

368
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,192
Really?
You know why? 'Cause I can

369
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,561
pay you in Invigaron.
I don't think you're quite

370
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,930
understanding.
Uh, this involves you giving us

371
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,299
cash, not a product that we
would then sell.

372
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,668
Sure.
See, we need cash money.

373
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,970
Oh, you're...
We're on the same page.

374
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,173
Okay.
I don't even understand what

375
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,341
he's talking about.
Yeah. Hold on one second.

376
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,710
No, take your time.
Listen, I think we might have

377
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,079
been wrong about Dee and
Charlie's little investment.

378
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,315
I mean, they're out there moving
berries like crazy.

379
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,884
If those bozos can do it, think
how many you and I can sell.

380
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,287
We could flip 'em, like, ten
times over.

381
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,622
That's what I'm saying.
So I say we swindle Da'Maniac

382
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:11,225
while we got him here.
Let's get in on Dee and

383
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,527
Charlie's little game.
Smart.

384
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,896
Pyramid scheme and a time-share?
We're diversifying our

385
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:18,299
portfolio.
That's the thing.

386
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,634
Okay, all right. Hey, Maniac?
Yeah.

387
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,603
Hey, you just got yourself a
deal.

388
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,171
We're in business together?
Yeah.

389
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,640
That's so cool.
I'm gonna go grab my stuff, and

390
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,276
then, if you wouldn't mind,
could you show me which room is

391
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,045
mine?
I'd like a big room, if you

392
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,180
don't mind.
We're gonna have so much fun.

393
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,217
Invigaron.

394
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:38,586
Uh... is-is he under the
impression that our apartment is

395
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,955
the time-share?
It would appear so.

396
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,290
Okay, you know what?
We'll deal with that later.

397
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,860
Let focus on getting Ben to
crack.

398
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,429
All right, now, between
Da'Maniac stealing our berries

399
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:50,998
and these night vision goggles,
we're in a bit of a hole, so

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,900
we got to make this count.
Okay. What's the plan

401
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,269
exactly?
We're gonna trigger Ben's

402
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,471
PTSD, all right?
We bust in like Navy SEALs,

403
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,640
zip-tie his hands, bag over his
head, and then we bash him till

404
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,775
he buys.
PTSD-- that's so brilliant.

405
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,611
How's Frank come up with that
stuff?

406
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,279
What can you say?
He knows business.

407
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,814
Okay, ready?
Locked and loaded?

408
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,582
All right.
Let's go, Charlie.

409
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,518
Let's move.

410
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,065
Oh, oh, oh!

411
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:30,104
Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here?
We were gonna try and trigger

412
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,406
Ben's PTSD and make him buy our
shit.

413
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,008
Good luck.
We've been at it all night.

414
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,010
We broke in here, looking like
Arabs, screaming at him.

415
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:39,446
The guy's rock solid. Why did you dress
him like Ebenezer Scrooge? Yeah.

416
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,215
He was actually dressed like
at when we got here.

417
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,551
He's clearly got some issues.
I just don't know that PTSD is

418
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,052
one of them.
Yeah, we've been watching

419
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:47,321
violent war movies all night to
remind him of the carnage that

420
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,123
he saw in combat.
I didn't see any carnage.

421
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,559
Um, I actually had a good time
during the war.

422
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:54,495
I got to travel the world, uh,
try new, exotic cuisines.

423
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,664
Well, I'm a computer programmer.
What?!

424
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,299
Goddamn it!

425
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,834
Frank told us this dummy was the
key to digging ourselves out of

426
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,937
our financial debt.
What?

427
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,172
Frank told us the same thing.
Well, that's interesting.

428
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,341
So, we're all here doing this
because of Frank.

429
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,143
See, I told you he was up to
something.

430
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,111
Hold on a second.
Getting all naked and cramming

431
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,113
yourself into a coil-- that's a
pretty good distraction, right?

432
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,282
Right?
Yeah, and think about it.

433
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,484
He didn't tell us why he was in
that coil.

434
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,653
No, no, no.
I just assumed that he went down

435
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,488
there to pound off in the
nighttime.

436
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,090
Yeah, right, right.
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

437
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:24,992
But now I'm absolutely sure
he had an agenda.

438
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:27,094
I bet he was never stuck in
that coil at all.

439
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,363
He's been at the top of the
pyramid the whole time just

440
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:31,665
gathering our cash.
Oh, right, right, or at the

441
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,367
bottom of the funnel.
I'm not sure which way it works.

442
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,336
Bottom of the funnel, top of
the-- they're the same thing.

443
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,304
Yeah, well, I bet you when we
go down there, he's not even in

444
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,106
there, is he?
No. Hell, no, he's not in

445
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,609
that coil, but I know exactly
where he will be.

446
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:44,378
All right, everyone, we have
a new addition to the platinum

447
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,213
sales staff, and let me just
tell you something.

448
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,116
This guy is an absolute dynamo.
Scam! This guy's a liar!

449
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,318
You guys are getting scammed!
You're getting scammed!

450
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,621
Pyramid! Pyramid!
Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!

451
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,423
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on here?

452
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,258
Well, I'll tell you what's
going on.

453
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,961
We are saving these people from
years of financial rape.

454
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,364
Oh, hey, if you want out of
Invigaron, all you have to do is

455
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:04,932
say so.
Wait.

456
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,166
I do?
Huh?

457
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,804
Look, you just, uh, sign this
release form, pay a $200 penalty

458
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:13,173
fee, your down line will shift
up to me, and then you're free

459
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,109
and clear.
That's it? All you got to do

460
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:16,477
is sign the document?
Can we do that?

461
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,145
Yeah, does that mean we're
out of the time-share?

462
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,447
Oh, no, no, I'm afraid I
can't help you there.

463
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:24,284
Those contracts are ironclad.
I'm just relieved you didn't see

464
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:27,655
the old opt-out clause.
Wait a second.

465
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:30,658
He just subtly motioned to this
document here-- opt-out.

466
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,192
Oh, no.
Oh, crap, I've said too much.

467
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,995
"Buyer may opt out of the
contract within 72 hours for

468
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,699
one-time cancellation fee of
only $2,000."

469
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,068
You figured it out.
Oh, you fool. I have...

470
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,405
You didn't think we were gonna see
this, but we outsmarted you. Yeah.

471
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,241
We're a couple of foxes.
All right, you got got!

472
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,476
So suck on that little piece
of sweetness.

473
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:53,914
You also wrote
"faced" in the memo. Ha! Nice!

474
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,883
Should have known better than

475
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,518
to get involved with a couple
sharks like you two.

476
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,620
You should have. We're just
glad we're out from under Frank.

477
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,055
Yeah.
Who's Frank?

478
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,023
Oh, "Who's Frank?" he says.
Like he doesn't know.

479
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,658
Come on, everybody.
Frank's the guy who's behind all

480
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,894
this; Frank is the mastermind
in the coil.

481
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,229
I sincerely have no idea what
you're talking about.

482
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,831
Oh, sure you don't, buddy.
Well, guess what?

483
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,700
He might not 'cause Frank...
Uh-oh. Oh, shit.

484
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,269
Oh, you thought we came in mad.
Wait till you see what this

485
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,804
monster has to say.
This guy?

486
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,839
What are you talking about?
This guy's the best salesman

487
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,040
I got.
Da'Maniac?

488
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,209
Yeah. He's already got 30
people under him.

489
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,678
I got to thank you all so
much for hooking me up with that

490
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,982
army guy. I got his whole platoon
selling for me. Wait a sec.

491
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,051
Da'Maniac's on my down line.
Yup.

492
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,288
I'm rich. I'm rich.
Oh!

493
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,224
You got got!

494
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,126
You got got! You got got!
Oh, whoa, one second.

495
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,528
One second, guys.
Actually, he's in my down line.

496
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,797
You just bought out, remember?
Shoot!

497
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,566
No, you... Oh!

498
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:49,203
This guy's good.
Oh, yeah. You know, sorry.

499
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:52,039
I want to get this stuff done
here, and then I'll meet you

500
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,676
back at our time-share, huh?
Okay.

501
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:58,178
Now, what's going on there?
Is he, like, living with you

502
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,480
guys, or...?
Yeah.

503
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,482
He's... It's-it's a whole
thing. Just move past it.

504
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,016
That's a hard thing to move
past.

505
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,551
Yeah, doesn't know what
time-share is.

506
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,220
All right, but hold on a
second, hold on a second.

507
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,755
Is Frank still the mastermind?
I don't get it.

508
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,523
Is he still in the coil?
No, he's not still in the

509
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,091
coil.
Come on, guys, he's definitely

510
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,193
still behind this.
He's probably down in Orlando

511
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,195
enjoying that time-share.
He's long gone.

512
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,664
Right. Wherever he is, he's
having a real good time.

513
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,800
Mm-hmm.

514
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:24,187
Hey! Hey, easy, easy, easy.

515
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:27,057
I gotta get out of here!

516
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,020
Get me out of here!

517
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,317
Get me out of here!

518
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:50,474
