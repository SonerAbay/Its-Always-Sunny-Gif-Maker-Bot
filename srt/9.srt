00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,236
[ dennis ] I just need
to get some leverage here.

<i>okay. Just pull.</i>
<i>I'm tryin' to pull it, dude.</i>

<i>pull harder, dennis.</i>
<i>If I pull harder,</i>

00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,142
It's gonna dig
into his leg.
Don't yell at me.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,478
I need to jam
the shears farther down--
jam 'em in there!

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,381
Pull harder, and I will!
Dude, you should get
a doctor to do this.

7
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,217
Oh, look at me!
The millionaire who goes
to see doctors!

00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,386
[ laughs ] come on.
Just pull the damn crowbar--
okeydokey.

[ screams ]
charlie, you want--

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,090
You want the cast off?
That's what you wanted. That's
what you were asking for.

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:29,061
Just soak it in hot water,
and it gets soft
and it peels right off,

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,463
Piece by piece.
What do you know
about anything?

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,666
What are you
even doing here?
Why are you still here?

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,402
- just want to be
part of the gang.
- you're not part of our gang.

15
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,871
You're not part
of the gang either, dee,
so forget that.

16
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,741
Yes, I am.
You're not. The gang is me, mac
and charlie. That's the gang.

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,145
- dennis, let your sister
be part of the gang.
- she can't be part of the gang.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,480
Why would you say that?
Is she part of the gang?

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,616
What gang?
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,252
- come on! Pull on it!
- hello. Excuse me.
I'm looking for the owner.

21
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,021
Yeah, that's us.
We're the owners.

22
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,258
My name is ari frenkel.
I just bought
the building next door.

23
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,293
Oh!
Great, man.
That's awesome.

24
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:05,631
I purchased it a few months ago,
but I was just able to move
my family into philadelphia.

25
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,633
- ah, yeah. Where from?
- israel.

26
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,269
Just got to be too dangerous--
you know, with everything
that's happening.

27
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,205
Well, that's a tough
situation you got over there.
You got that whole tsunami--

28
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,207
No?
Well, the superdome
thing that--

29
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,775
Charlie.
No, there's no superdome.

30
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,111
It's one of those places
over there.
It's a different country.

31
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,780
Why don't you shut up?
Never mind. I had a--

32
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,049
Anyway, I just--
yeah, it's all good.
<i>[ chattering ]</i>

33
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,752
- stopped over to give you this.
- what is this?

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,054
- it's a notice to vacate.
- what?

35
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,190
Yeah, according to the zoning
grid, the piece of property...

36
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,593
That I purchased extends
exactly 100 feet to the north.

37
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,030
Anything south of that
dividing line belongs to me.

38
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,967
- well, where's
the dividing line?
- mmm, right about... Here.

39
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,236
What?
Bullshit!

40
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,872
- gonna need you
outta here in a week.
- you can't do that.

41
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,975
- dad, stay out of this.
We can handle it, all right?
- l-look-look, man!

42
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,245
I don't know how you guys
do things in-- what was it?
Israel.

43
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,148
Israel.
Israel or whatever,
but this is america!

44
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,852
You can't just come in here
and steal our land from us.

45
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,689
I'm-- I'm pretty sure
that's how this country
was founded in the first place.

46
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,059
What are you saying?
You're making things up now.

47
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,128
I don't know what that means.
Does anybody know what--

48
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,563
If you're talkin' shit
about america, we are
gonna kick your ass.

49
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,266
- I'm sure you will.
- this is our bar.

50
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,703

He really gets my goat.
You know what I mean?

57
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,458
You shouldn't be allowed
to come in, tell people,
"hey, I own this. I own that."

58
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,460
Okay, the butter goes on,
then the peanut butter.

59
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,862
Hmm? What are you doing?
Peanut butter
go in the middle?

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,398
With the choc--
[ spits ] don't-- do not put
peanut butter on that!

61
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,001
What?
A grilled charlie
has peanut butter last.

62
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,003
Okay, either inside
or outside.
Peanut butter outside.

63
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,604
Chocolate inside.

Okay, man, we talked
about this, right?
<i>[ knocking ]</i>

00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,784
Breathe.
[ exhales ]
yeah.

70
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,487
Let it out.
Say "I can do this."

71
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,589
I can do this.
All right.
Go answer the door.

72
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,292
No, no, no. You answer the door.
I don't want to get smacked.
I'm not-- okay, look--

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,295
Where are your balls, dude?
Where are your balls?
Okay? You're a grown man.

74
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,531
Think about your balls.
Where are your balls?
Start swinging--

75
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,067
Charlie, don't talk
about my balls.
<i>Open this door!</i>

00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,069
I can't even mention
your balls around you. Okay.

77
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,138
Charlie, she's all hopped up
on amphetamines.
Well, okay.

00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,640
I'll get your back, and--
I can hear it in her voice.

Look, if you don't
do this now, you're never--

<i>Just do it.</i>

Hey, barbara.
Don't you
"hey, barbara" me.

00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:20,592
Jesus christ, frank.
This place is a shit hole!
Is this how you've been living?

84
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,595
- we make it work.
What do you want?
- I want to talk.

85
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,198
I tried to talk to you
weeks ago.
You went on vacation.

86
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,200
I was trying
to scare some sense into you.

87
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,736
You were talking about
giving away all of our money.

88
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,272
My money.
I made it, you spent it.

89
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,741
Burn.
There you go, buddy.

90
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:39,445
How can you say that to me?
After everything I've done
for you.

91
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,614
While you were out making money,
who do you think was at home...

92
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,250
Cooking and cleaning
and raising your children?

93
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,453
A series of mexican women.

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,422
A series--
unbelievable, dude.
You're on fire.

95
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,926
You can choose to live
like an animal if you want to,

96
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,462
But I refuse to be
subjected to it.

97
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,933
I want my shit back.
You took my shit from our home,
and I want it back.

98
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:05,070
- I didn't take anything.
- it's empty. Someone came in
and took everything.

99
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,340
Maybe you should have
somebody deported like you
used to in the old days.

100
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,909
Beautiful.

101
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,911
Oh! Oh!

102
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,080
I can't even talk to you
anymore.

103
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,817
Standing up for yourself.
Standing up for immigrants!

104
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,155
I don't know what you're
turning into, frank,
but it's making me sick!

105
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,427
Stings, doesn't it?
Yeah.

106
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,162
[ chuckles ]
it hurts really bad.

107
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,164
Yeah. You got
a little hand mark.

Dude, you're burning!
You're burning!
Ooh, shit!

109
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,902
All right, all right.
With the peanut butter--
you have ruined this one!

110
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,638
No, no.
Put the peanut butter on--
you ruined that one.

111
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,608
Apparently, mr. Frenkel
is citing a zoning grid...

112
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,277
That was created by
the original city planners.
Wait.

113
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,513
So this asshole's using
a law that's, like,
300 years old?

114
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,515
That's bullshit!
Yeah. You can't do that.

115
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,818
You guys had an opportunity
to buy the land at the time
of the original purchase.

116
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,620
You declined.
<i>[ charlie ]</i>
<i>so what?</i>

117
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,122
You also had
a second opportunity
when the fiscal quarter--

118
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,558
Let's not get into
the blame game here, man.
Solutions.

119
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,461
Yeah, let's talk solutions.
How do we get this guy
out of our bar?

120
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,165
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem
as though you guys have
any legal recourse.

121
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,235
We don't have any...

122
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,838
Legal recourse.

123
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,473
No.

124
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,475
All right.
I think I follow, fellas.

125
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,477
All right.
We don't have any--

<i>What you're saying is, uh,</i>
<i>we got to get creative.</i>

128
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,656
If you're implying
that I'm advising you
to do anything illegal,

129
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,658
Then I'm afraid
you're mistaken.

130

No, of course
we're mistaken.
No, no, no. Yeah, no.

131
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,897
We're mistaken.
No, we would never want to
implicate certain parties...

132
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:44,436
In certain matters, but--
no. But if certain parties who
has, uh, certain experiences--

Certain affiliations.

<i>We could really, uh--</i>

- get out.
- okay. I think
the lawyer's right.

138
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,925
We gotta send this guy
some kind of message.

139
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,028
It's time to take action,
but we should be careful.

140
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,930
I don't want to come off
as anti-semitic. This guy's
a jewish person--

141
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,766
What's that have

Yeah.

We don't have
a problem with jews.
It's this guy in particular.

Don't use the word "jew."

I don't appreciate that.
Nah, that's okay.

That is a racial slur,
charlie, and--
calling somebody a jew...

146
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,210
Who is a jew
is not a racial slur.
Please stop. No.

147
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,513
Will you please not use
the word "jew"?
It makes me uncomfortable.

148
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,749
It's not anti-semitic.
It's about the context.
If you use the right context,

149
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,918
You're good.
You're the most misinformed
person I've ever met.

You don't know what's

Are you guys serious?

Maybe you should leave it to me.

Of course, bro.
I read the newspaper.
Okay. Well, you know what?

Why don't you crack
an egg of knowledge
all over me, buddy?

Okay. Can I start?
Yeah.

on terror, charlie.
Mm-hmm.

Okay?
Okay.

Charlie, it is a war
on terror.
We have decided...

To help the people
of israel--

164
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,421
To give our oil back to us--
by defeating
saddam hussein.

My head is, like, swelling
with knowledge.
It's freedom, charlie.

You're being sarcastic...

Stupid customers.

if I come any further, am I?

How are you?
I'll tell you how I am,
deandra.

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,090
I am devastated. I don't
understand what is going on
with your father. And I--

Oh-- y-yea-- yeah.

But here's the thing
about the earrings--

180
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,439
You're stealing
from your mother now?
What kind of monster are you?

181
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,109
Dad said he was gonna give all
your stuff away, and then it
was actually dennis's idea--

182
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,713
Don't blame this
on your brother. How low
can you sink, deandra?

00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,050
I haven't seen you
for a month, and I'm standing
here in a neck brace.

Are you gonna ask
how I'm doing
or what happened or--

I assume you did
something stupid.

186
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,892
Dennis ran over me
with his car.
There you go again!

187
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,729
Don't you think it's
about time you start taking
responsibility for your actions?

00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,066

I want my possessions
returned.

I've been running around.
I haven't had time
to feed the dog.

Could you stop thinking
about yourself for once?

And besides, you don't
need it, sweetie.

Well, that's attractive.

195
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,384
Maybe if you took a bit
more pride in your appearance,

196
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,388
You could find a man,
and then you wouldn't have
to steal from your mother!

197
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,757
I mean,
look at your skin, deandra.

Christ, there is a sun
in philadelphia.

He's already got
a construction crew
in there working?

Oh, god, dude.
I am sick of staring
at this building, guys.

We gotta take some action.
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you what.

202

Let's throw a flaming bag
of poop in the window.

What? Why?

204
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,277
Because they stamp it out
and they get poop
all over their shoes.

This ought to do it.

Yeah. Okay, so what's
the next step?

There is no next step.
This is it.

This is it?
Yeah.

It's awesome.

this isn't gonna do shit?
There needs to be a next step!

219

get toilet paper off a building,
especially if it rains?

Come on, man. You can't

You dropped

You can say it, but it has
to be in the right context.

You guys said I could say "jew."
