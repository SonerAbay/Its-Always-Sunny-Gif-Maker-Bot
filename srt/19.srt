1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,443
There's no way that
a mouse could kill a scorpion.

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:05,200
A mouse's got sharp claws and teeth.

3
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:07,001
- A rat can kill a scorpion.
- No shit,

4
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:09,494
we're not talking about a rat,
but about a little mouse.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,214
A rat still would lose.

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,301
A little mouse fighting a scorpion.
And that is final!

7
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:16,705
Stop!

8
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,640
Shut up!
Oh, my God, I don't care.

9
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:23,351
All we're doing is arguing about
the most stupid shit!

10
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:25,698
A rat, a scorpion, I don't care, man!

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,777
When did this start happening?

12
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,053
When did we start arguing all
the time and fighting?

13
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:31,234
This isn't like us.

14
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:34,112
Look, we're working our asses
off in this bar, you know,

15
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:36,859
we're getting nothing to show for it,
so we're starting to snip

16
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,745
and pick at each other, it's bullshit.

17
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:41,048
'Cause guess what?
It's a beautiful day outside, okay?

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,955
We need to change things up.
Let's go outside.

19
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,352
Let's get some fresh air.

20
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,372
Let's run around a little bit,
you know?

21
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,404
Let's just do something different.

22
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,819
You know what, Charlie,
you're right, this is great.

23
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,879
It's nice to do something
different for a change.

24
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:57,252
Yeah, enjoy a little blue sky,
some fresh air.

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,108
Some Earth beneath our feet.

26
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,347
- See, I told you guys you'd like it.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,018
It's goddamn bright out here.

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,021
- It's so bright. It hurts my eyes.
- It's blinding!

29
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:12,066
- People are playing football.
- It's like there's no room to drink.

30
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:14,152
I would like to go back to the bar.

31
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:15,903
Let's go back to the bar.

32
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:17,411
Are you kidding me?

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,365
Oh, look out.

34
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:21,033
Can I get that back?

35
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:23,375
Yeah, go long and I'll toss
you a wicked spiral.

36
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,247
Wanna just give me the ball, dude?
We're trying to practice.

37
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,083
- What are you practicing for?
- I'm trying out for the Eagles.

38
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,504
- Uh, the Philadelphia Eagles?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:35,746
They're holding tryouts
for the public.

40
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,433
Like in that movie, Invincible.

41
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:42,005
The one with the guy from the New Kids
on the Block makes it onto the Eagles?

42
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,389
- I saw that.
- That's the one.

43
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,579
A good one.
So they're actually doing that?

44
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,255
Just give me the football.

45
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,982
Well, Dennis, I think you
know what we have to do.

46

00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,217
{\pos(192,205)}Did you read this flyer?

50
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,841
{\pos(192,205)}Donovan McNabb is going to be
giving us a motivational speech.

51
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,524
I know, dude. We are actually going
to be running on the Linc.

52
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,026
Lincoln Field, baby.

53
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,111
You think you're gonna make the team?

54
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:43,322
Hell, no, we're not. But we will
finally get to prove once and for all

55
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,746
who's the better football player.

56
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,382
Trying out for the Eagles
is the best way to settle that score.

57
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,538
I would like to join
your little competition.

58
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:57,880
You're a woman!

59
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,299
Women can't do things like this,
you'll get hurt.

60
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:03,536
- Women aren't allowed to try out.
- Well, that's ridiculous.

61
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,403
They should at least
be able to try out.

62
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:08,143
Well, there are plenty of other sports
that women can try out for.

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,839
Like cooking and...

64
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,090
Complaining to your friends
about your boyfriends.

65
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,490
Playing at ballet...

66
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,779
Cleaning, displaying cars at
auto shows in tiny bikinis.

67
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,185
Yeah, when you get older
you can play bridge together.

68
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:21,813
You know what? I am in such better
shape than both of you guys.

69
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:24,824
The first thing they're gonna do
to weed people out is to make you run?

70
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:26,575
Oh, good luck.

71
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,969
I could get so much further than
both of you.

72
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,374
Do you think that's a possibility?
That could be very embarrassing.

73
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:37,652
Well, we're never going to have
to find out because she can't try out.

74
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,339
- You can't try out!
- That is a rule, right?

75
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:41,799
Check the rules.

76
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:45,469
A layer of beer, then a layer of ice.
Hey, what are you guys doing?

77
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,514
- We're going to tailgate the tryouts.
- Shit, that's a good idea.

78
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,309
- You're gonna bust out Green Man?
- No Green Man.

79
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:52,685
What's Green Man?

80
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:55,029
In high school, Charlie was
like our school mascot.

81
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,405
A mascot nobody wanted.

82
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,442
He'd get wasted and dress in
this green spandex bodysuit.

83
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:00,997
Spandex?

84
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,218
That's it, you've got to
bring the Green Man suit.

85
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:07,383
No, Green Man was good,

86
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,244
it got me through some hard times,
but I'm done with it.

87
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,967
You can wear it if you want,
but I'm just gonna be relaxing.

88
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,659
It's gonna be about
chilling out for me.

89
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:17,251
No, this is going to be
exactly like Woodstock.

90
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,095
Is it? Are you planning on getting
yourself locked in the bathroom

91
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,756
of your cousin's Winnebago for 3 days?

92
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,174
Shut up about that.

93
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:27,636
I survived on hand soap and
toilet water for three days.

94
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,430
The memory haunts me.

95
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,757
The Linc, dude, the Linc!

96
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,986
I am actually gonna be able
to look down

97
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,908
and literally see how many yards
I'm running.

98
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,654
- This is gonna be awesome, dude.
- We might actually get further

99
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:45,599
in this tryout than we thought.
See how many yahoos are trying out?

100
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,667
- I'm seeing a lot wearing capes.
- There are like 15 guys wearing capes.

101
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:51,247
Why would you wear a cape?
What advantage does that give you?

102
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:53,517
Absolutely none. You know what?
Have a little respect.

103
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:56,829
We're here with the Philadelphia Eagles,
they're opening up their doors to us.

104
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,633
- This is a boyhood dream.
- I know, why even come out here

105
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:02,514
if you're not gonna take this
somewhat seriously? I mean...

106
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,393
- You done pissing yet?
- I haven't even started,

107
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,166
you're standing next to me,
talking to me,

108
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,341
- it's making me nervous.
- All right, another beer?

109
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,557
Yeah, another beer for Christ's sake.
Gonna sit here and not drink another?

110
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:15,193
Yeah.

111
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,052
Okay, the cabana is assembled,

112
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,674
the grill is as sparkling
as we're gonna get it,

113
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,200
the margarita machine here
is open for business.

114
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,516
Time to relax.

115
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,479
Want to drop some acid with me?

116
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,215
What?
You're dropping acid?

117
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,958
Woodstock, baby!

118
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:40,811
Okay, well, no, thank you.

119
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:44,542
I believe that we'd have the complete
opposite effect of relaxation for me.

120
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:46,871
Well, I'm going to trip balls.

121
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,806
You messed it up. It's too high.
It doesn't look right.

122
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,175
Too high? No, I'm good at it.
I did a good job on you.

123
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,407
'Cause I've good cheekbones.

124
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,732
- You have?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,405
'Cause you put foundation all over them.

126
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,395
I put a light base on...
just a, it's got SPF.

127
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,647
What's up?

128
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,316
- What the hell is this?
- How's it hangin'?

129
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,278
- This is a joke, right?
- You think anyone's gonna buy that?

130
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:09,447
- Whatever, bro.
- You're gonna get crushed.

131
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,726
The second that your body touches that
field, it's gonna shatter like glass.

132
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,651
- You got bones like glass.
- I don't.

133
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,403
You spent half your life
in a back brace.

134
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,747
Your body is like 90% scoliosis, Dee.

135
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,916
Line's moving, fellas.
Let's get on the bus.

136
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:23,275
Bus? What the hell
are you talking about?

137
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,796
The bus that takes you to the field.

138
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:27,986
I thought we were gonna be
playing on the Linc.

139
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:31,260
You think you dipshits are gonna play on
the same field that champions play on?

140
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:32,678
Where we going?

141
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,401
"Where we going?"

142
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,579
We're going to a shitty high
school in Bucks County.

143
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,968
Now get your ass on the bus.

144
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,277
If I say it one more time...

145
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:40,641
If I say it one more time...

146
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,355
If I say it one more time!

147
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,607
Sprint to the bus.

148
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:50,613
That's everyone on the bus, dude.

149
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,148
They're leaving.

150
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,438
Maybe they're having tryouts
at a different place.

151
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:56,570
Son of a bitch.

152
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:59,330
All right, screw it, man,
we're here, we'll just relax.

153
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,048
Sit here and look at the
Linc?

154
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:04,175
We look like a couple of dicks
in the yard. Get out of here!

155
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:05,753
We got to get up and go.

156
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:08,640
Let's go follow that bus! Come on!

157
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,974
All right, you get that.
You get that, come on.

158
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,907
- This is too much work.
- Charlie, get up!

159
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,555
- This is work! I didn't want to go.
- Get the stuff, we'll follow the bus.

160
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,558
I like your mustache.

161
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:24,763
- Thank you.
- I can't grow one.

162
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,264
Okay.

163
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,729
- That's a pretty sweet cape.
- Thank you.

164
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,391
My mom made it.

165
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,747
- She did a very good job.
- Yeah, she's talented.

166
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:41,649
I can't believe we're not gonna be
on the Linc. This is bullshit.

167
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:44,974
Half the reason I wanted to do this,
was to be out on that field.

168
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,254
Hey, man, stop smoking, will you?
Some of us are trying to make the team.

169
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:51,343
- Are you kidding me, bro?
- No.

170
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:54,512
Guy, if you think you're actually going
to make the Philadelphia Eagles,

171
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,078
then you're pathetic.

172
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:58,597
- You're pathetic.
- No, you're pathetic, sport.

173
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,955
- You're pathetic!
- You're the one who's pathetic!

174
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:02,017
Whatever, man.

175
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,966
When I'm done with this tryout, you'll
go back to your sad, pitiful life,

176
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,488
and I'll be on the Eagles.

177
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:12,278
And everybody in Philadelphia
will know the name McPoyle.

178
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,421
- What did you say your name was?
- McPoyle. Doyle McPoyle.

179
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,204
The unibrow.

180
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:20,077
Yeah.

181
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:22,337
- The unibrow.
- Yeah.

182
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,211
- The eczema...
- He's definitely a McPoyle.

183
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,996
There are so many of those people.

184
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,652
Now, this is what I'm talking about!

185
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,466
- I don't know.
- Look at all the people!

186
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,636
W're stuck over here by the portable
shitters. That's kind of lame.

187
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,388
Stop bitching and set up.

188
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,141
I'm not setting anything up.
I'm sitting in my chair,

189
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,352
I'm relaxing, I'm getting blackout drunk
and you're leaving me alone.

190
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:47,251
All right, be a party pooper.

191
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:50,482
- What are you doing, dude?
- Taking more acid.

192
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,375
Classic mistake, Frank.

193
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,320
You're making a classic mistake,
you know.

194
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:56,578
Will you shut up and sit in
your stupid chair?

195
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,028
It's your funeral, buddy.

196
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,742
- Just shut up.
- Hey there, guy.

197
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,528
That's good, that's good.

198
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,430
Are you kidding me, man?
What the hell is that shit?

199
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,439
Come on, dude.
You almost ran me...

200
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,378
- Oh, my God, the McPoyle brothers.
- Hello, Charles.

201
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,343
- What are you doing here?
- We came to support our brother Doyle.

202
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:15,758
He's going to make the
Eagles.

203
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,517
- Well, that's fantastic.
- Whatever man. That's great.

204
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,534
But your bus is spilling over
into our space.

205
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:23,015
- You almost ran me over, man.
- You got to move.

206
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,142
- Move it back a few feet.
- No.

207
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:26,935
No can do. We need the space.

208
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,326
For what?

209
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,147
The whole family's here.

210
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,512
Oh, that's great.

211
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,653
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?
Great, of course...

212
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,941
How many...?
What is that a jar of?

213
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,616
What is that a jar of, dude?

214
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:44,536
How many can there possibly be?
Oh, good to see her again. Good.

215
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,331
She doesn't know what I'm saying, right?
Oh, here he comes.

216
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,499
Yeah, you're here in the world.

217
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:50,751
That's the sun.

218
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:53,337
- It's going to hurt your eyes.
- Watch your mouth.

219
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,674
What is that, a fife?
You brought your little flute.

220
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,217
Is there more? Are there any more?
Get them all out.

221
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,842
All right, look, I tell you what.
Leave me alone, okay?

222
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:02,797
I don't care what you do.
Just leave me alone,

223
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:04,222
'cause I'm here to relax

224
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:06,657
and have a good time,
I don't your shit, all right?

225
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:07,893
So, leave me alone, okay?

226
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:10,263
We be cool. We're even now.

227
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,774
- Bump it.
- I'm not bumping your fist.

228
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,526
- Bump it.
- Do it, bump it.

229
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:19,163
I'm not bumping you, all right? I never
bumped 'em once, and I'm not gonna...

230
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,719
All right, whatever. No bumping.

231
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,117
I just don't want to.
These guys are freak shows, man.

232
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,035
- Hustle up!
- Hustle, brother!

233
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:26,620
Let's go, bitches.

234
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:28,539
Let's move it!

235
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,065
I was here first, Coach.

236
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,196
- Hustle!
- Coach, hi! Hi, there.

237
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,968
Cole. Cole Armstrong.

238
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:37,152
Three-time All-American fastest
sprinter in five counties, Coach.

239
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:40,426
Would you like us to stand when you
address us, or to take a knee?

240
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:41,802
I don't give a shit!

241
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:43,785
Okay.
I'll take a knee.

242
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:45,052
I'll take a knee.

243
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:48,257
We're doing these trials for you!

244
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,158
Because of your harassment

245
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:52,813
and your love for the New Kids
on the Block movie.

246
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:57,223
You paid the $30 fee.
We promised you a keynote speaker.

247
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:01,067
All right, bring him up.

248
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,516
McNabb, dude!
McNabb!

249
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,404
Gentlemen!

250
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:11,679
- Uh, this good here?
- Yeah, that's cool.

251
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:13,494
Just put your parking brake on.

252
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,145
Donovan McNabb.

253
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,578
Hey, guys.

254
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,065
I'm Donovan McNabb.

255
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,969
Uh, I played quarterback for the
Philadelphia Eagles,

256
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,472
and I'm here to tell you
that you can, too,

257
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,463
if you start every day with a hearty
breakfast from McDonalds.

258
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,745
Uh, like the new sausage-egg
McGriddle value meal,

259
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:37,242
available now for a limited time
for under $5.00.

260
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:40,334
Uh, remember, guys, real champs
eat at McDonalds.

261
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:42,989
I'm lovin' it.

262
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,364
Can I get the check?

263
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,561
- What the hell was that?
- Thanks, Donny.

264
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,629
- That wasn't Donovan McNabb.
- That was not him!

265
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:54,864
- That was like a McDonald's plug.
- Was that the guy fromThe Cosby Show?

266
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:57,002
That's not the guy fromThe
Cosby Show.

267
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,512
- Yeah, he was married to Sondra.
- Alvin! Alvin!

268
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,260
They had Raven Symone. That's So Raven.

269
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,716
That is not the guy from...
You know what?

270
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:04,918
Sprints!

271
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,815
Goddamn it!

272
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:10,782
Good job, dude.

273
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,138
I'm starting to feel it.

274
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,284
- I bet you are, bud.
- Feeling weird.

275
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,483
Yeah, you're probably
feeling very weird.

276
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,120
The acid's making me feel
like I got to take a dump.

277
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,173
That's what happens
when you take a lot of acid.

278
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,505
I got to go.

279
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:28,222
- Then go.
- The line is too long.

280
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:31,899
- Maybe I can't hold it in.
- Then go in the McPoyle's camper.

281
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:32,996
Oh, no.

282
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:36,019
That might bring back bad memories.

283
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:37,920
I think I'm going to hold it.

284
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,052
- How are you feeling?
- Annoyed.

285
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:43,226
- There's nothing kicking in yet?
- What are you talking about, the beer?

286
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:44,766
No, the acid.

287
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:47,088
I did not take any acid, remember?

288
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,265
Oh, yeah, you did.

289
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:50,639
What are you talking about?

290
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,342
I put a shitload of it in your beer.

291
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,251
- What?!
- Yeah.

292
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,786
Is that why those pieces of papers
were floating in my beer?

293
00:12:56,847 --> 00:13:00,160
I drank all that shit, dude.
There was like a ton of acid in there!

294
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,233
Why did you do that?

295
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,334
I don't wanna be the only one tripping.

296
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,688
Oh, my God!

297
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:08,866
- I actually really have to go...
- Oh, my God!

298
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,076
Shut up! I don't care.
Go in their camper.

299
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:15,339
Get out of here!
Oh, you sick son of a bitch, dude.

300
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,966
Why would you...?
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

301
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:24,614
- You ready to quit yet, Cole?
- You had enough yet, Cole?

302
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:25,674
Yeah, Cole.

303
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,635
- You ran for ten minutes.
- My side is going to explode.

304
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,545
You're in terrible shape.
This is gonna be easier than I thought.

305
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,303
- Let's go! Move it, come on.
- Oh, so much pain.

306
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,486
All right, now we've got
our hearts pumping.

307
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:43,108
Let's pick out some gear,
pick a partner... hitting drill!

308
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:44,890
I pick Cole.

309
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,765
Oh, no, he did it.

310
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,662
That's my dance.
That's my signature dance.

311
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,286
I wanna do that when I tackle people.

312
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,927
I like your form, I liked how you went
before the whistle.

313
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,749
- Goddamn right.
- Nice.

314
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,351
All right, guys,
let's pick new partners.

315
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:10,385
Eenie, meanie, miney, mo.

316
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:17,935
Nice. All right, you're up, man.

317
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,231
Hitting's not really my thing, Coach.

318
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:26,485
Spoken like a true champion.
You just might make the team.

319
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:30,661
- Awesome. Really?
- Jesus Christ.

320
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,422
Okay, Frank, that was easy...
now just exit, don't talk to anybody.

321
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,828
These people are freak shows.

322
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,176
Wait... better wash your hands.

323
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,013
No telling what kind of germs
these McPoyles have.

324
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,388
I'm starting to feel weird.

325
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,014
What the hell? Not again.

326
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,701
Oh, no! Hey!

327
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,010
Somebody get me out of here!

328
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:07,589
Man, my brother just leveled
your boy out there.

329
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,305
He's going to make the Eagles.

330
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,533
Your boy is a pansy,
but Doyle's a big, strong guy.

331
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,865
'Cause he eats all that fish.

332
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:15,649
Is he just going to talk at me?

333
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,199
I am going to lose my shit.

334
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,496
What's going on with his head?
It's too small

335
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:22,040
or tight or something.
Yeah, that's it.

336
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,583
His skin is too tight.

337
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:25,544
My skin's not tight.

338
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,176
Good catch, Doyle!
Good catch! Way to hustle!

339
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,650
Way to hustle!
All right, who's next?

340
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:36,826
This guy.

341
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,601
All right, run out and hook
in.

342
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:45,022
Run out and hook in. Show these people
how to play football.

343
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:49,797
I'm going to make Mac look so bad.
My form is perfect.

344
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:52,865
I'm like Jerry Rice.
Feel that stride.

345
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:54,853
So fluid and fast.

346
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,014
I've got the stride of a gazelle...
a beautiful, beautiful gazelle person.

347
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,227
My body is achieving a perfect
symmetry right now.

348
00:16:02,574 --> 00:16:05,380
It's that long, lean muscle I've
worked so hard to achieve.

349
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,367
I should have popped my shirt off.

350
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,047
Goddamn it, I really should have
popped that shirt off.

351
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:13,216
I wonder if any women are
watching from the sidelines.

352
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,563
All right, Dee, you can do this.
You can kick a football.

353
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,839
You're better at sports
than Mac and Dennis.

354
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,148
Holy shit!

355
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,484
The other coach has got to hear
about this.

356
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,057
Well, well, look who's a natural.

357
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,267
Guess I'll be getting further
than you, after all.

358
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:42,996
- Maybe it was a lucky kick?
- No.

359
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:45,195
Those stork-like legs,
they act like pendulums,

360
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:48,738
and on the bottoms of those
pendulums, feet like wrecking balls.

361
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,831
We got to do something
about this, dude.

362
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,882
Let's go talk to Frank.
Come on, I got an idea.

363
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:55,699
Somebody!

364
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,594
Somebody help!

365
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,136
Goddamn it!

366
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:01,306
Goddamn it, not again!

367
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,087
Frank.

368
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:09,637
Hey, Frank.

369
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,511
Who said that?

370
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,450
I'm Artemis. I'm Dee's friend.

371
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,659
- I'm trapped.
- I know,

372
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,478
but I can help.

373
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,421
Crawl into my mouth.

374
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,517
I don't think I could fit.

375
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:29,459
Sure you will.
Just go one leg at a time.

376
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:33,497
Okay.

377
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,392
Into the toilet I go.

378
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:48,244
Man, this is crazy. You are dancing
with the entire McPoyle family.

379
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,831
These people are freak
shows, man. Freaks.

380
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,316
But you're keeping your cool,
you're keeping your cool.

381
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,461
You know why?
Because you are the Green Man.

382
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,387
Green Man is saving your life
right now, bro.

383
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:01,049
Just go with the flow.

384
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,648
Charlie, we've been looking
all over for you, dude.

385
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,245
Green Man, I knew you couldn't resist.

386
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:06,509
Huh?

387
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:08,582
I'm actually tripping
pretty hard right now.

388
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:10,096
You're tripping?

389
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:13,954
Yeah, Frank gave me some acid
and it's like... whoo!

390
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,337
Hey, guys.

391
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:17,814
Guess who got invited
to training camp.

392
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,117
We're going to be famous.

393
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,386
Look, we need to talk to Green Man
alone for a second.

394
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,470
Thank you? Yes, bye.

395
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,500
Can we talk to the Green Man?
Let's go. Thank you.

396
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,935
- Where is Frank? It's very important.
- Really important.

397
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,520
Oh, Frank?
Oh, he's standing right there.

398
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,524
Frank, what the hell are you doing?

399
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,236
He's been trying to climb through
that trash can for 20 minutes.

400
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:40,509
I'm pretty sure he's on acid.

401
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:43,867
Thank God, you guys are here.
How'd you get in here?

402
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,327
What are you talking about?

403
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:49,357
- I've been stuck for 3 hours.
- I think he took a dump in there.

404
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,760
- Can you give us a second, please?
- Whatever.

405
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,987
I'm getting tired
of watching him anyway.

406
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:56,213
Frank, listen.
Did you bring your gun today?

407
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,177
Great. Now walk me through the plan.

408
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:01,024
The plan is:
I get close to Dee, all right.

409
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,245
She goes to punt the ball,
I fire, it'll startle her,

410
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:04,830
- she'll blow the kick.
- Great plan.

411
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,279
Wait a second. How long have we
been standing right here?

412
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,267
- Like, two seconds.
- Seriously?

413
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,232
Frank, give me the gun.
We're in a hurry.

414
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,603
- Where is it?
- In your hand.

415
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,064
Wait, wait!

416
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:15,963
When the hell did I put Green Man on?

417
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:17,827
- I don't know.
- That lizard talks!

418
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,487
Where?! I don't like lizards!

419
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:22,636
We don't have time.
Frank, give us the gun!

420
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:26,972
Lizard, am I standing in poop?

421
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,705
I'm about to demonstrate to all of you
my natural abilities as a punter.

422
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,535
I'm gonna kick this ball 60 yards right
in front of your faces,

423
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:34,831
and I'm gonna do it...

424
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,046
as a woman.

425
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,132
Oh, that's right.
I'm a woman!

426
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:44,302
And I'm about to show all of you
that women should be allowed

427
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,763
to try out for
the Philadelphia Eagles. Coach?

428
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,818
Wrap your minds around this.

429
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:56,861
Damn!

430
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,150
Oh, I broke my...
Oh, I maybe broke it.

431
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,012
Oh, sweet Jesus, I think I broke it.

432
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,531
- Keep your legs.
- All right, you're out of the trash.

433
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,200
A deal is a deal. Give us the gun.

434
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,906
Hold on. I'm really peek in here.

435
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:13,415
Stop pointing the gun at us.
Point it at someone else.

436
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,530
Nobody minds making
a little dance right now.

437
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:18,023
- Nobody cares of you dancing, Charlie.
- Hey, guys.

438
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,713
Could somebody take me to the hospital?

439
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm pretty sure I broke
every single bone in my foot

440
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,481
- punting that football.
- Really?

441
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:26,303
I didn't make it, but I'd like to go
to the E.R. right now, please.

442
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:28,286
So your bonesaremade out of glass!

443
00:20:28,387 --> 00:20:29,389
Yes.

444
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,321
No, my bones aren't...
You know what?

445
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,683
It doesn't matter because
I made the furthest, so I win.

446
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,338
I win, because you're the girl
and you got knocked unconscious.

447
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,949
You got crushed, dude.

448
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,659
That is so stupid! Guess what?
I made it the farthest.

449
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:45,947
- You just shattered every bone...
- What are you talking about?

450
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,456
Holy shit, this thing is loaded.

451
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:51,190
- My leg!
- Doyle, are you okay?

452
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,683
My leg! Somebody shot my leg!

453
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:55,944
No!

454
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,566
Oh, that's not good.

455
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,958
No, that could come back
and bite us in the ass.

456
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:06,790
- Ready? Go.
- Let's go!
