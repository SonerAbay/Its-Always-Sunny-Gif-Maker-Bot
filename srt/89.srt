1
00:00:00,956 --> 00:00:01,855
(knocking)

2
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:02,823
CHARLIE: Hey, knock, knock.

3
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:04,110
BONNIE: Oh, hi, Charlie.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,164
Hey, Ma.

5
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:08,167
Listen, you're doing me a solid
offering to do this laundry, all right?

6
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:09,001
Well, we never get to talk.

7
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:09,836
That's why I offered.

8
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:11,704
We don't talk, and it's good that way.

9
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:12,538
MAC: Hello.

10
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:13,339
Hey, Mac's here.

11
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:14,306
He brought his laundry.

12
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:15,341
Thanks a bundle, Mrs. Kelly.

13
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,778
I got Frank's stuff, Dee's stuff, Dennis'
stuff, so you're gonna be working.

14
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:22,281
Oh, okay, well, what I wanted to talk to you about...
Ooh, talky, talky, talky,

15
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,248
talky, talky.

16
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,283
You know, Mom, we're busy.

17
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:25,751
We got a whole big day planned.

18
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:28,187
Yeah, we got to go back to
Paddy's and polish off a couple

19
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:30,155
beers, so it's like...
Beers, you know, but hey.

20
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,123
Time is of the essence.

21
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,225
We'll come back when it's
folded and good and done.

22
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:34,694
I'd like to bring it up now.

23
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,228
Um, I have cancer.

24
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:40,165
Yeah, but I got to... I'm sorry. What?

25
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,233
I have lung cancer.

26
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,668
What?

27
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:44,169
But how?

28
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,371
You don't even smoke.

29
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:49,844
Well, you know, it's just
one of those freak things.

30
00:00:50,577 --> 00:01:01,130
Sync & corrections by 

31
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,023
SWEET DEE: And then Psychic
John said that he could tell I

32
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,259
was under a tremendous amount
of stress and that my heart was

33
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,293
filled with sorrow.

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,595
Now how would he have known
that if he wasn't psychic?

35
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,864
FRANK: I'm not giving you any
money for your dumb psychic.

36
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:25,433
But he says I'm gonna have a
tremendous windfall of cash.

37
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:26,501
You're losing your mind.

38
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:27,769
You're being scammed.

39
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,070
I'm losing my mind?

40
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:33,208
How many pairs of shoes have
you lost this month, Frank?

41
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,610
Three.

42
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,577
Hmm?

43
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:37,913
Four. That's not the point.

44
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,183
The point is my mind is as sharp as a...
what do you call it?

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,886
Um, it's a... Knife?

46
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,824
No, uh, what you put... What you... What you...
I just don't understand why

47
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:49,791
it's my fault.

48
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,793
It's your fault because your
mom is directly responsible.

49
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,795
Yeah, but we both decided to
move them in together, so you

50
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,763
know, you deserve half the blame.

51
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,699
You want to put half the blame on me?

52
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:59,100
Guys, my mom has lung cancer.

53
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,636
DENNIS: Oh, God.

54
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,671
You know, geez.

55
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,974
That's-that's terrible.

56
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,176
What the hell was that, dude?

57
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,377
That didn't sound very genuine.

58
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,279
No. Sorry.

59
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,613
What was I supposed to do?

60
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,582
What are you... Are you kidding me?

61
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,517
Are you screwing with me right now?

62
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:17,352
No, I'm sorry.

63
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,287
I think the cancer thing, for
whatever reason, is just not...

64
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,122
You know, it's just not
grabbing me right now.

65
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,957
Not grabbing you?

66
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:22,824
My mom is dying!

67
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,859
Okay, calm down, calm down.

68
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,661
Okay, because my mom has a
doctor that can cure the cancer

69
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,196
for 4,200 bucks, so no big deal.

70
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:30,165
4,200 bucks? To cure cancer?

71
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,000
That's it?

72
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,201
No, I mean, that's a scam.

73
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,402
That's what I was saying.

74
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,603
Do you think it's a scam?

75
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,840
Come on, people take advantage of old
people and scam them all the time.

76
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,841
Thumbtack.

77
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,842
What?

78
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,809
Thumbtack.

79
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,945
We were talking about things
that earlier that were sharp,

80
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,847
and a thumbtack is sharp.

81
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,148
Thumbtack?

82
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:47,983
Yeah.

83
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,751
All right. You see what
I'm talking about?

84
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:51,719
People get old and then their
brains turn to mush, and then

85
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,521
people come along and
take advantage of them.

86
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,757
Now, Frank, give me the hundred
bucks you were excited to give

87
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:56,892
me for my psychic.

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,293
Oh, yeah.

89
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,694
Sorry.

90
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,661
Here you go.

91
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:01,629
Thank you.

92
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,999
Yeah.

93
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,568
Where the hell are we?

94
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:10,438
I mean, your mom's totally screwing
my mom again with this doctor scam.

95
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,606
No, it's not a scam, Charlie.

96
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:14,342
She's been seeing this guy for
years, and she doesn't have cancer.

97
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,345
Yeah, I got to say, though, this is a
strange place for a doctor's office.

98
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,579
What's this guy's name?

99
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:19,680
Dr. Jinx.

100
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,917
Dr. Jinx is the name of
a monkey, not a man.

101
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,918
Come in.

102
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,085
He lives in a garage?

103
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,187
Yeah. Guys, look, let's just
give him a shot, all right?

104
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:28,723
If we don't like what
we see, we reassess.

105
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,091
All right. Go.

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,393
(music playing)

107
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,727
Oh, I'm sorry.

108
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,662
Are you Dr. Jinx?

109
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,197
Indeed I am.

110
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:37,899
Have a seat.

111
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,268
Goddamn it.

112
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,940
So, what are we gonna do, guys?

113
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,944
I'd just like to say this
is, uh, this is weird.

114
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:51,379
Now, I can understand your suspicions.

115
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,714
Now, when most people think of a
doctor, they don't think of a

116
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,318
black man living in a garage
surrounded by houseplants.

117
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,518
I normally think Asian.

118
00:03:57,586 --> 00:04:00,388
Yeah, or I think of an Indian guy.

119
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,522
Or white.

120
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,458
Middle Eastern. Pretty much
anything other than black.

121
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:04,459
Is that racist?

122
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:05,427
Hell, yeah, it's racist.

123
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,396
Your parents ain't let you watch <i>The
Cosby Show</i> when you was coming up?

124
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:11,199
Oh, my parents would never have
let me watch something like that.

125
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,001
Let's not make this about racism.

126
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,503
Let's make this about the man
who's living in a garage

127
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,571
treating my mom for cancer.

128
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:21,109
Hey, hey, now, look, here's my deal: I
use ancient homeopathic remedies derived

129
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,243
from the Mother Earth.

130
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,479
You can't get no cleaner than that.

131
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,481
Homeopathic from Mother Earth, huh?

132
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:30,618
Dr. Jinx, I have an eczema situation
that's burning me up good.

133
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:31,652
Do you have anything for that?

134
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,620
Oh, shit.

135
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:33,654
Well, that's not eczema.

136
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:36,591
What you have there, my
friend, that's sailor's rot.

137
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:37,758
Sailor's rot?

138
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:38,860
I'm not a sailor, Dr. Jinx.

139
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,962
When was the last time
you've been to Haiti?

140
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,064
Never. I've never been to...
I've been to Kensington.

141
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,033
When you was in Kensington,
did you have intercourse with

142
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,168
any hoes, ladies of the
nights, or prostitutes?

143
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:50,071
No. No. I have... Don't worry about it.

144
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,039
Doctor-client privilege.

145
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:52,040
Don't worry about it.

146
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:53,341
I got what you need, okay?

147
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,010
Oh! Oh! Oh, that burns!

148
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,378
(groans)

149
00:04:56,445 --> 00:04:57,979
Mother Earth don't play.

150
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,248
Do you have anything from the
Mother Earth that would be

151
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,784
sprayed on me and cause me to
have feelings again 'cause I'm

152
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,353
having trouble feeling things.

153
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,522
Oh, you want feelings?

154
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,557
Oh, I have something for that.

155
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,360
Dr. Jinx got something for feelings.

156
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,695
(plays funky bass line)

157
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:31,913
Okay, so that was a scam, right?

158
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,747
Yep.

159
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:33,848
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

160
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,816
I think he sprayed me with Miracle-Gro.

161
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:37,519
All right, guys, my mom
has real problems.

162
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:38,420
I need real help.

163
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,155
Oh, I got it.

164
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:44,759
I know exactly who we
need to turn to next.

165
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:54,838
♪ Raise you up on eagles' wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn ♪

166
00:05:54,958 --> 00:06:09,350
♪ Make you to shine like the sun and
hold you in the palm of his hand. ♪

167
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:11,519
Holy, holy, holy.

168
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:17,492
Lord God of power and might, heaven
and earth are full of your glory.

169
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,526
This is ridiculous.

170
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:19,494
What are we doing here?

171
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,096
We're turning to the big man upstairs.

172
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,063
He's gonna make this right.

173
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,865
I can't believe you think this is
a real solution to our problem.

174
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,301
Dennis, what do you think of all this?

175
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,236
Shh. Amen.

176
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,437
I'm just trying to embrace this.

177
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,839
I want to see if I can
knock some emotion loose.

178
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:32,907
This is ridiculous.

179
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,143
Hey, hey, hey, don't
say that; now kneel.

180
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,578
Why do I have to kneel?

181
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,612
I don't see the point.

182
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,746
Because God wants it.

183
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,449
Look, just do what the priest
says; don't ask why, just do.

184
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,151
Look, our moms are here.

185
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,452
They see the value in it.

186
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,587
Why can't you?

187
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,254
(coughs)

188
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,222
Where's your mom going?

189
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,190
Oh, she keeps a cigarette
burning out on the steps

190
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,992
outside, so she's gonna go hack a butt.

191
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,927
So, she just comes and
goes as she pleases?

192
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,895
There's no sort of rules for her?

193
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:56,831
She's put her time in here, all right?

194
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,633
The Lord makes an exception for her.

195
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,634
Jesus Christ, man.

196
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:02,103
Hey... stop using his
name in vain; now, stand.

197
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,070
(groans) Stand?

198
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,006
Yes, and give me some
money for the baskets.

199
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,007
No, I'm not giving you money.

200
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,975
We have to give money...
Thank you, thank you.

201
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,910
Look, maybe the church should
give us money, you know?

202
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:10,845
They seem to have plenty of it.

203
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:13,481
Dude, the church doesn't give
money; it takes it, all right?

204
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,449
That's the way it works.

205
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,450
And then you go to heaven.

206
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,184
Now, kneel.

207
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:17,152
Kneel? I got to kneel again?

208
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,153
Actually, it's over.

209
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,120
We're standing again.

210
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,087
Son of a bitch!

211
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:21,088
This is a scam, okay?

212
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:22,056
This is a scam.

213
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,759
It's kneeling, standing,
getting people all confused.

214
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:25,993
Hey, hey, come here.

215
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:26,994
What are you doing?

216
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,095
What are you doing?

217
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,063
Offering you a sign of peace.

218
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,031
I don't want this.

219
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,399
Peace be with you.

220
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,733
Can I say something?

221
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,235
Can I say something?

222
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:35,270
Sorry about your mother.

223
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,238
(Charlie groans)

224
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,378
Okay, I want to talk about
someone in your life.

225
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:43,045
Okay.

226
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,013
Okay, someone close to you.

227
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,014
All right.

228
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:51,854
I'm getting a Fa... No, I'm getting a Ba...
No, I'm getting a Da... Dennis?

229
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:52,821
Dennis!

230
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,789
Is it?

231
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,924
Yes, yeah, no, I'm seeing that.

232
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:56,892
Dennis?

233
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,893
Yup, yup, I'm seeing Dennis.

234
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,861
Okay.

235
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:03,366
And I am feeling as if he is a neighbor...
or an enemy.

236
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:06,469
He's a coworker, friend, he's a relative...
He's my brother.

237
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:07,436
He's your brother.

238
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:08,437
Oh, my God.

239
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:09,405
Yes.

240
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,340
Is he how I'm getting
my windfall of cash?

241
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,010
You know, I'm not seeing clearly
yet how you get the cash.

242
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,979
I do see a lot of money in your future.

243
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:17,946
You do?

244
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,149
Yeah, but... (laughing): Oh, shit.

245
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:24,853
I think it's gonna take a few sessions
to really get the whole picture.

246
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,954
Is it?

247
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:29,292
Ha-- I was just out buying
new shoes and I remembered

248
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,827
I didn't want to give
you that hundred bucks.

249
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,029
Yeah, and then you called me
and you said you changed your

250
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,165
mind and you'd like to give me
another hundred, so where is it?

251
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,132
I did?

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,133
Yeah.

253
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,502
Ah, shit.

254
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:40,703
Hi. Psychic John.

255
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,438
You have an interesting aura.

256
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:43,972
Don't start with me.

257
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,776
Who's gonna win the
Super Bowl this year?

258
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,312
You don't know shit.

259
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,080
Well, I do know that you lost
three pairs of shoes this month.

260
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,950
You have a pork chop bone in
your left pocket; you have 57

261
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,720
cents in your right, and you
clipped someone's side mirror

262
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,423
while parking in a handicap spot.

263
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,524
Holy shit.

264
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,525
That's good.

265
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,794
Can you conjure the dead?

266
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,464
Can you get my dead whore wife
back here so I can lay into her

267
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,799
from the other side?

268
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,500
Well, I can't do that.

269
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,502
Nah, because you're full of shit.

270
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,272
I can't do it because I feel her
spirit is still very much alive.

271
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,574
(gong rings)

272
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,710
What? No, well, I don't
know about that.

273
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,110
W-W-Wait a minute.

274
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:25,881
I knew there was always something
suspicious about that whore's death.

275
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:26,849
Really?

276
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,384
Yes, we didn't ask any questions.

277
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,284
We never saw the body.

278
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,220
We didn't go to the funeral.

279
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,189
I am feeling as if she is
still living somewhere in the

280
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,659
city with a small Mexican dog.

281
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:37,626
(Sweet Dee gasps)

282
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:38,794
Does that ring a bell?

283
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:42,665
Ooh, that dirty bitch.

284
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,468
Well, I'll tell you, guys.

285
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,203
I didn't feel much in there, but I
do always enjoy the little wafers.

286
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,139
Of course you do because you're
consuming the actual body of Christ.

287
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:52,941
Uh-huh, well, he was delicious.

288
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,909
Wait, what?

289
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:56,579
You're eating our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ every Sunday, that's...

290
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,147
You're telling me that you
believe that Christ comes back

291
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,984
to life every Sunday in the form
of a bowl of crackers, and then

292
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,652
you proceed to just eat the man?

293
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,856
Correct, you consumed his corpse and you
drank his blood; that's a part of...

294
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:07,857
Good, good, good, good.

295
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:08,824
This is what we're dealing with.

296
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,092
Hey, Mom.

297
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,861
Can I talk to you for a second?

298
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:12,862
Why are you here, honestly?

299
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,530
I was praying for help.

300
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:15,731
I need the money for Dr. Jinx.

301
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,535
Dr. Jinx is a con artist and a lunatic.

302
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,505
I-I know he's strange,
but he's a great doctor.

303
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,472
He really does cure people.

304
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,473
Hey, guys, look at this.

305
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,409
My rash is almost
completely cleared up.

306
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:27,410
Oh, my God.

307
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:28,377
Whoa.

308
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,344
Yeah, look at that.

309
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,313
Whatever he sprayed on me worked.

310
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,282
He might actually be a good doctor.

311
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,316
Oh, shit.

312
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,319
Hi, everybody, just a reminder
if you wouldn't mind.

313
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,155
We're asking for extra donations
for the statue of the Blessed

314
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,724
Mother that was vandalized last week.

315
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:42,425
What the shit, man?

316
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:43,225
Charlie.

317
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:46,061
My mother is dying of cancer and
you need money to fix a statue?

318
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,863
No, no, no, no, don't give me this act.

319
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:48,831
Charlie, calm down.

320
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,800
No, no, no, why don't you
give us some money, okay?

321
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:51,767
How much is that ring worth?

322
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,736
That looks like an expensive
ring; can we have the ring?

323
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:56,505
Okay, uh-uh, I'm sorry, Father,
I will pray for his sins.

324
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,506
I'm sorry.

325
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,273
What are you doing?

326
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,241
It's okay. I got this.

327
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,042
What am I doing?

328
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:00,843
What is he doing?

329
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,844
No, listen, listen, listen.

330
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,279
Don't get all riled up about this
scam or that scam, you know.

331
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,414
It's all a big scam, okay?

332
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:06,415
Yeah.

333
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,350
But I will say this, the church's scam?

334
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,418
It's a pretty good one.

335
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:10,385
It's effective.

336
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,688
Look at all the money these
people are giving to the church.

337
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,492
So, I say we use that model to raise
money for your mom at Paddy's.

338
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,761
Guys, let's throw a beef and beer.

339
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:21,296
A beef and beer-- it's been years.

340
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:22,264
Beef and beer, huh?

341
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,232
Yeah, we invite the members
of this congregation down to

342
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,201
Paddy's for cheap beef
and watered-down beer.

343
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,136
We'll prey on their Catholic
guilt by playing up your mom's

344
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,438
cancer and "Oh, she's dying,"

345
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:32,174
and she is, you know, and we'll
raise a bunch of money to give

346
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,175
to your mom to give to Dr.

347
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:33,809
Jinx.

348
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:35,310
It's the Holy Trinity:

349
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,947
beef and beer and Jesus.

350
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,984
FRANK: Dig, dig, dig.

351
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:45,087
What makes you think she's got
money buried in the dog's grave?

352
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,689
Well, she can't use a bank.

353
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:49,057
She's probably got money
buried all over the city.

354
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,527
Oop, there we go.

355
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:52,495
Yeah, dig it up, dig it up.

356
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,462
Come on, buddy.

357
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,230
Oh, yeah.

359
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,832
Aah, goddamn!

360
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,967
Aw, there's a dead dog in there!

361
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,134
Gross!

362
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,970
That's not a dog.

363
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,806
That's my toupee, my blond toupee.

364
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,307
I used to wear this in Miami.

365
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,308
She hated this goddamn thing.

366
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,275
Oh, she didn't like that?

367
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,010
No.

368
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:09,411
You are an idiot.

369
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,515
Oh, my God, there is some cash.

370
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:13,983
That dirty whore.

371
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,951
There's got to be, like,
five grand in here.

372
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,554
I bet she's probably got this
stuff hidden all over the city.

373
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:20,122
I can't believe this.

374
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,123
She's alive.

375
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,259

he's gonna want to be in the loop.

00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,197

Stop it. Pipe down.

382
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,536
My head is turning to soup.

00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,570
Okay, I get it.

Hey, uh-uh, Mr... Juarez.

385
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,841
Mr. Juarez, that's right.

386
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,777
You remember the Mexican family
whose house we burned down and

387
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,811
we had to give them our mansion.

388
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,916
Oh, how do you like the mansion?

389
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,051
Oh, it's been very, very nice.

390
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:52,320
You know, the weddings, the
quinceañeras, but it's very expensive.

391
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:55,658
Uh, how you call it, uh, property tax.

392
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:56,959
It's too much.

393
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,093
Yeah.

394
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:58,928
We had to leave.

395
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,296
Anyway, I am back here every Saturday.

396
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,330
Why?

397
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:06,268
Oh, I have to go to work.

398
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,469
Aw, shit.

399
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,437
Well, that sucks.

400
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:09,504
Tell you what.

401
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,574
Property taxes-- paying
for what you already own?

402
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,943

Mom, turn your head that way.

419
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:01,733
Can we do more lesions?

420
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,749
No, dude, the lesions are fine.

421
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:04,549

I don't know why I have to wear all
this makeup, and wear a bald cap.

424
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,951
Mom, you want people to
feel sorry for you, right?

425
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:11,952
Then they give a lot of money.

426
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,887
And you just don't look that sick.

427
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:14,688
You gotta look sicker.

428
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:15,923
But I feel like it's lying.

429
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,158
Oh, it's not lying, Mrs.

430
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,992
Kelly, because you are dying of cancer.

431
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:19,993
Yeah.

432
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:21,995
It's devouring your insides.

433
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:25,766
But we need for it to devour your outside,
so it plays better for our audience.

434
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,735
Yeah, look, Mom, it's just basic
Hollywood stuff, all right?

435
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:29,537
Don't fight it.

Why can't you get Frank
to give me the money?

437
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,108
Frank's not really like a
big charity kind of guy.

438
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,109
He's not really gonna give it.

00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:36,077
Okay.

00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:37,945
Let's talk about the speech, okay?

00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,713
Can you go over the
speech that we gave you?

This speech is too graphic.

It... it needs to be graphic
to get their attention.

445

Maybe it does.

483
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:21,815
Or that this man, Dr. Jinx...
who am I to say that he can't

484
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,117
cure diseases with his sorcery?

485
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,786
I don't know.

486
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,389
I say, maybe he can.

487
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:30,724
And I believe that maybe he can.

488
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:39,766
Ladies and gentlemen, if we believe...
if we just believe...

489
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,536
then we can do anything!

490
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,871
(cheering)

491
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:45,872
(whoops)

492
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,541
Oh, yeah, ladies and
gentlemen, I feel it now!

493
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:48,375
Do you feel it?

494
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,677
Do you feel the spirit?

495
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,846
Do you feel the invisible things
around you that don't really exist?

496
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,047
Oh, it doesn't matter!

497
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:55,782
Dr. Jinx feels it, yeah!

498
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,817
Woo, I feel good!

499
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:57,784
Yeah!

500
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:00,421
We feel magnificent, yeah!

501
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:03,857
And we can cure cancer with plants.

502
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:04,358
(cheering)

503
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:05,992
Amen.

504
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,893
Mm, thank you so much.

505
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:07,961
Thank you so much.

506
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,263
Oh, oh-oh-oh.

507
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,232
Dennis, that was amazing, dude.

508
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,266
I am so proud of you.

509
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:13,701
You are feeling again.

510
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,969
No.

511
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,205
I meant none of it.

512
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:19,172
Let's go, Mom, come on.

513
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,841
Just read the speech.

514
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:21,908
I don't think I can do this.

515
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:22,909
You-you can do it.

516
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:23,777
You'll be great.

517
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:26,714
My... my mom has a speech!

518
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:31,352
"Thank you all for coming to
our Beef and Beer and Jesus.

519
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:38,292
As you know, I'm as sick as a
three-legged dog on the streets of India.

520
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,096
Any minute, my lungs are going
to sizzle, pop, and disintegrate

521
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:47,000
into a liquid lung and
organ gumbo soup."

522
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:48,702
That was my line.

523
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,670
Nice.

524
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:50,738
Mm.

525
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:52,539
(whispering): Charlie, I can't do this.

526
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:53,440
Just get to the money part.

527
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:55,142
All right, just get
the money part done.

528
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,277
"Give me money.

529
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:57,678
Money me.

530
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,012
Money now.

531
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,948
Me a money needing a lot now."

532
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,284
That was Charlie's line.

533
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,318
Yeah.

534
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:05,286
Eh.

535
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:06,553
Charlie, I-I can't do this.

536
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,554
Doing great.

537
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:08,522
Doing great.

538
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,091
I have a confession to
make to all of you.

539
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,126
Don't do it, bitch!

540
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,128
I don't have cancer.

541
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:16,129
What?

542
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,197
(gasping)

543
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,668
(murmuring)

544
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:24,838
We're the ones that broke
the Virgin Mary statue.

545
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,508
We accidentally hit it with our car.

546
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:32,379
Mm... We were trying to raise
money to get it fixed.

547
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,014
That's just crazy.

548
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,617
You could've just told me the
story about hitting the statue.

549
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,619
I mean, where did you
come up with this idea?

550
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,955
Well, I learned everything
by watching you.

551
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:45,426
Well, I... Oh... Aw, shit,
I did do that, huh?

552
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:47,528
Yeah, you totally... you
pulled that shit on us, too.

553
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,196
Well... You son of a bitch.

554
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:50,163
That's no excuse.

555
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:52,933
Yeah, well, at least you didn't
try and grift a doctor, though.

556
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,668
No, no, I never actually
said I was a doctor.

557
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:57,204
He is the goddamn church gardener.

558
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:58,572
A gardener?

559
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,040
I guess that would explain this.

560
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:00,808
Oh!

561
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,909
Oh, Jesus... I was gonna
talk to you about that.

562
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:03,744
I'm really sorry.

563
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,546
You had my back up against the
wall, I had to spray you with a

564
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:07,797
heavy dose of pesticide.

565
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,931
Put some aloe vera gel on there, a
little bit of vitamin D... What?

566
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:11,784
He doesn't know that.

567
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:12,652
He doesn't know that.

568
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,748
Don't get a diagnosis from him now.
Why... how would you know that?

569
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:15,565
Goddamn it.

570
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,200
Dennis. Dennis!

571
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,724
Mom's alive.

572
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,726
She faked her own death to steal
Frank's money, and we think it's

573
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:21,561
buried in her grave.

574
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,928
That dirty whore.

575
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,072
Everybody get a goddamn shovel!

576
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,836
This is such a perfect place for
that bitch to hide my money.

577
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,772
Oh, Psychic John talked about this.

578
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,475
He said I was gonna come into a
windfall of cash, and it's all in here.

579
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,510
Yeah, and then we can use some
of that cash to pay for the

580
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:40,780
statue that our moms broke, Charlie.

581
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,282
All right!

582
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,283
(coughing)

583
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,083
You guys ready?

584
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:44,917
Crack it open, Charlie.

585
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,554
(chanting): Charlie, Charlie...
(chanting): Show me the

586
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,589
money, show me the money... (whooping)

587
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:51,224
Ah, shit!

588
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,292
(screaming)

589
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,227
No! No!

590
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,461
Mommy, Mommy!

591
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,063
Ah! I grifted ya!

592
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,431
What are you talking about?

593
00:19:58,499 --> 00:19:59,965
I paid off the psychic.

594
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,468
I buried the money in the dog grave.

595
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,637
(crying): My mommy, my
mommy's a skeleton!

596
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:09,018
I grifted your asses good because
you said I was slipping.

597
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:10,038
I feel too much!

598
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,106
I feel too much!

599
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,207
(sobbing)

600
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,876
You made me dig up my dead mother
because I said you were losing it?

601
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:17,303
Score one for the old people.

602
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,222
Ha ha!

603
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,562
Wait a minute.

604
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,336
What the hell happened to my shoes?
