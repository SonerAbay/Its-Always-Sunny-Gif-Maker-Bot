1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,654
Hey, guys, why are the
urinals filled with rocks?

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:06,549
Oh, 'cause I put
a bunch of rocks in 'em.

3
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:09,206
Oh, okay, why?

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,716
Well, you know how they were broken,
so I was, like, filling them with ice.

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,884
Now the ice machine's broken, so I'm
just filling them up with rocks.

6
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,785
You know that doesn't
make any sense, right?

7
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,587
Replacing the ice with rocks?

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,820
The ice actually served a purpose...
Oh, oh, God!

9
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,659
Oh, something just
dripped in my mouth!

10
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,027
Yeah, the ceiling is leaking.

11
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,428
Oh, that's gross.

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,797
What'd it taste like?

13
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,931
What'd it taste like?

14
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,967
Who gives a shit what
it tasted like, Frank?

15
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,202
Dude, what the hell?

16
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:35,304
You have been docking our
paychecks lately so that you

17
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,205
could pay for shit like
this around the bar.

18
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:38,139
Why is nothing fixed?

19
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,710
Yeah, by the way, I never agreed
to let you dock my paycheck.

20
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:42,780
That seems like something
we should all vote on.

21
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:48,785
- It costs money to run this place and keep it main...
- Hey-oh!

22
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,520
What's up, bitches?

23
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:52,121
What the shit is this?

24
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:53,121
New scooter.

25
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:54,556
My surrogate money came in.

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,526
30 G's, babies.

27
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:57,993
Oh, sweet. Where's our cut?

28
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:58,794
Your cut?

29
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,529
Whoa, hey, Mac makes
a really good point.

30
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,530
Yeah, we worked our asses off
on that baby scheme of yours.

31
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:04,365
Give us part of the
money that you made.

32
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,733
What the hell are
you talking about?

33
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,101
You did nothing
for nine months.

34
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,069
Get out.

35
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,405
You couldn't have pulled something
like that off without us.

36
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:12,373
Yeah, they drove you to the
hospital, they picked you up.

37
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,608
I was there, I recall.

38
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,913
Okay, I made all the contacts,
I pushed that little

39
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:19,784
monkey out and now I'm going to
be claiming him as a dependent

40
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,219
and getting tax breaks
for the next 18 years.

41
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,454
So you talk about a scheme?

42
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,224
How's that for a long-term
scheme, bitches?

43
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:32,297
Uh, you guys all better eat a dick,
'cause Sweet Dee beat the system.

44
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:42,337

45
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,375
Oh, no, no, no, lady.

46
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,097
Sorry. Get out.

47
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:04,131
Whatever god you're selling,
I ain't buying it.

48
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,851
Miss Reynolds, I'm with the IRS.

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,744
We've been trying to
contact you for months.

50
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,515
Have you not received
any of our letters?

51
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,900
Letters? What is it, 1986?

52
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,234
I don't do letters, lady.

53
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,302
I'm all digital.

54
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,204
Well, if you had opened up the
letters you would understand

55
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:18,406
that you're being audited.

56
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:19,974
Audited?

57
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:21,175
Why?
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,378
I'm not scamming the government,
if that's what you're saying.

59
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,814
Your license plate
says "$CAMMIN."

60
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,883
Uh, no.

61
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:30,118
What do you mean no?

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,554
Yes.

63
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:37,693
Okay, I want to talk to you about
this dependent that you're

64
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:41,163
claiming-- this, uh,
Barnabas Reynolds.

65
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,365
Yes, I would love that.

66
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:47,702
I would love that because I love
to talk about little Barney, I do.

67
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:50,138
But now's not a great time,
you know what I mean?

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,643
Because I left him in the car--
with the window down of course.

69
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:55,778
It's hot.

70
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,812
It's hot, isn't it?

71
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:58,080
Well, is there a better time?

72
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:00,149
Would 3:00 work?

73
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,851
3:00 sounds great.

74
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:04,087
I can't wait for 3:00.

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,294
Hey, Frank, we need to talk.

76
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:13,131
We don't want you making any major
bar decisions alone anymore.

77
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,733
Because you're sleazy
and we don't trust you.

78
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,301
Yeah, we want to vote
on things now, okay?

79
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:17,369
We want a democracy.

80
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,838
Well, that ain't gonna work.

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,307
Because you guys get really
emotional about everything.

82
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:25,510
You'll start arguing about shit
and nothing will get done.

83
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:27,546
We know we're emotional people
and we've discussed that.

84
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:28,814
We think we have a solution.

85
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:32,684
We're going to have a daily meeting
where we will discuss all bar matters.

86
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:35,020
Emotion will be suppressed
and reason will prevail.

87
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,020
Reason will prevail!

88
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:38,088
Oh, yeah, we decided also that
we would say "Reason will

89
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,025
prevail," every time someone says...
Reason will prevail!

90
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:43,093
You don't have to say it
right now, because I'm just

91
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:46,029
explaining to Frank that reason will prevail...
Reason will prevail!

92
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,764
Again, you don't have
to say it right now.

93
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,634
I'm just explaining... If we're going to
say it, we're gonna say it every time.

94
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:54,771
If you made up the rule...
Okay, I'll tell you what-- I like this.

95
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:55,672
You do?

96
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:56,539
Yeah.

97
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,341
We should definitely do this
to make everything fair.

98
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:01,277
Everything aboveboard.

99
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,278
Let's go do it in there.

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,145
Come on.

101
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,984
The first meeting of Paddy's
congress shall commence henceforth.

102
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,285
Oh, first order of business.

103
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:09,819
Yeah?

104
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,220
Let's talk about how
Frank handles the money.

105
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:11,720
Yes.

106
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,856
Money, money, money, money, money, money...
Whoa, whoa.

107
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,724
I know we got to talk about the
money, but there are other

108
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:16,892
issues that are pressing, too.

109
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,193
Like what, dude?

110
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,361
Like one that comes to
mind is the dead dog.

111
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,295
What dead dog?

112
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:22,296
The dead dog in the alley.

113
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:24,198
It's been there
for about a week.

114
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,834
Yeah, and we decided that Charlie
was going to throw it in the trash.

115
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,868
No, you decided that.

116
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,036
We never got a vote.

117
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:31,204
If Mac and I got to vote on
that, we would have voted to,

118
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,140
like, you know, have
a proper dog burial.

119
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,309
That's a waste of
time and resources.

120
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,744
Okay, well, hold on a
second there, Frank.

121
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:40,147
Let's put our new
process into action.

122
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,615
I think the guys should have a
opportunity to state their case

123
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,984
in a rational and
unemotional way.

124
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,018
Guys, you have the floor.

125
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,153
Yeah.

126
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,254
All right, sure. Easy.

127
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:49,155
All right. No problem.

128
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:54,393
Okay...
Uh, okay, sometimes dogs die.

129
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,861
Right.

130
00:04:55,863 --> 00:05:02,201
Um, dogs, uh...
die from cars sometimes.

131
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,502
Sometimes not.

132
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,571
There's also... Disease.

133
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:11,277
There's also disease
in America and abroad.

134
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,315
Many dogs... Goddamn it!

135
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,452
I don't know how to express myself unless
through anger and personal attack!

136
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:20,387
I'm getting very upset, because
I'm not saying it right!

137
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,222
All right, guys, guys...
I want a dog funeral!

138
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,124
Guys, calm down.

139
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:27,261
I'm going to step in here and I'm gonna
speak for you for a moment, if I may.

140
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:29,129
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to spend all of our

141
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:32,967
hard-earned cash on some ornate
display for the disposal of

142
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,302
what amounts to an
animal carcass.

143
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,406
An animal that we never knew--
or had a relationship with.

144
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:41,609
So I'm going to-- I'm going to go
ahead and say that I think we

145
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,744
should just throw
it in a Dumpster.

146
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:43,278
Come on!

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,848
Oh... But, but, but, we'll
have a candle on site.

148
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,982
We'll light it.

149
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,685
We'll have a boom box there and
you guys can say a few words.

150
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,888
Huh. I don't love it.

151
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,956
Me neither.

152
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:58,194
But that dog is turning into
hot soup out there in the sun.

153
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,161
Okay.

154
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,229
Frank?

155
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,364
Fine.

156
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,064
Okay!

157
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,332
Hey, it works.

158
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,135
Great. See, Frank, we can get through
these issues and be unemotional about it.

159
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,636
That's one issue off the
docket right there.

160
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:08,537
Next issue.

161
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:09,438
Let's talk about the money.

162
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,541
Money, okay... Oh, yes, we're going to
talk about the money, but we have a

163
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:15,444
list of things on the docket
here that we've got to check off.

164
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,579
And if we're gonna do it right,
we're gonna do it right.

165
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,649
And the next thing on the list
is limes and how we slice them.

166
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,650
Thick or thin?

167
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:23,318
Okay, let's talk about
the limes, guys.

168
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,186
We'll keep emotion out of it.

169
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:24,886
Reason will prevail.

170
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,388
Reason will prevail.

171
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,123
Okay, I think the limes
should be cut a bit thinner.

172
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,291
What the hell?!

173
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:30,659
Thin limes?!

174
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:31,560
People will choke!

175
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:32,494
People will die!

176
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,228
Calm down.

177
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,496
Charlie, Charlie, take
emotion out of it.

178
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:35,496
Charlie's got a point.

179
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,965
One of the cornerstones of
Paddy's Pub is thick limes.

180
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,901
Yeah, don't tell me... I'm going to put
my thumb through your eye, you little

181
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:41,635
bitch!

182
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,003
No, no, no. Shh.

183
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,038
Stay calm, stay...
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.

184
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,939
Look at me, eh?

185
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:46,940
Stay calm with me, okay?

186
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,508
Be unemotional.

187
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,243
Let's-Let's be democratic.

188
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,145
Let's put this thing to a vote.

189
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,713
A vote?

190
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,616
A vote solves everything in
a democracy, does it not?

191
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:57,383
Yes.

192
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:01,187
So, all for thinner limes,
raise your hands.

193
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,190
And all for thicker limes,
raise your hands.

194
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,057
Now, there you go.

195
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,659
That's a democracy in action.

196
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:09,795
That's two votes
against two votes.

197
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:13,793
A perfect example of when
democracy has failed.

198
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:27,917
Good news, Dee!

199
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,056
We have decided to occasionally
let you vote on some pressing

200
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,225
matters in the bar
as we see fit.

201
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,092
What?

202
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,261
Where do you land on thick
limes or thin limes?

203
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:37,496
And try and keep your emotions
out of it even though people

204
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,264
could choke and die.

205
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,431
What are you talking about?

206
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,433
What's, what's going on in here?

207
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,701
Are you having another baby?

208
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:43,702
No! No, it's fine, okay?

209
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,004
I have it all under control.

210
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,705
I just, I'm getting audited.

211
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:47,673
Audited? Oh, she's screwed.

212
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,674
That's the tax man?

213
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,575
Yeah.

214
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,644
I'm not screwed.
I got it all under control, okay?

215
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,578
I've got a handle on it.

216
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,814
I just got to find a baby
by 3:00 in the afternoon.

217
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,216
Just get out. Just get out now.

218
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,286
Hmm, a vote for thin limes would
get me out of your apartment.

219
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:02,256
Better yet, a vote for thick
limes, I'll throw myself full

220
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,091
force into this little
baby caper of yours.

221
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,226
I don't need your help.

222
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,361
Look, Dee, you need our
help, we need your help.

223
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,363
Let's work something out here.

224
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:11,199
I don't know which stance you're
gonna do, and I don't wanna do it.

225
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:12,100
Stop, stop standing like me.

226
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,402
Okay, yeah, let's help
each other out, okay?

227
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:15,336
I got an idea.

228
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:18,339
You guys go magically find me a
baby by 3:00 in the afternoon,

229
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:21,008
and then I'll-I'll help you
out with your lime problem.

230
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,809
Okay.

231
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:22,643
Yeah.

232
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:23,778
What?

233
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,313
We can get you a baby.

234
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,782
Yeah, you want, we'll get you
a baby, no magic required.

235
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:28,783
How many babies you need?

236
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:29,818
Yeah.

237
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,685
Just the one baby.

238
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:31,619
How long? Couple hours?

239
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:32,420
3:00 this afternoon.

240
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,022
No, no.
How long you need it for?

241
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,356
You want it for life or you...?

242
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,190
Just a short-time baby.

243
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,091
Just a short-time baby.

244
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,425
Just a short-time baby? Easy.

245
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:40,628
Oh, my God, you guys,
this is so exciting!

246
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,495
Oh, this is amazing!

247
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,997
You have no idea how
much you're helping me.

248
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,667
Okay, let's see, um, all
right, I tell you what.

249
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,304
Here's how to handle
your lime situation.

250
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,672
It has been decided.

251
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:54,707
We are now the Pickle Party.

252
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,643
And Dee has joined us.

253
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,846
We are going to vote for pickles
in the bar instead of limes.

254
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,381
What are you talking about?

255
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,182
It doesn't matter.

256
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:04,951
The point is, our three votes
will always beat your two.

257
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:05,619
We win, dude.

258
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:06,486
We're the winners, okay?

259
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:08,355
Give me a beer with
a pickle in it.

260
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,357
Well, what happens when you
three disagree with each other?

261
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,358
We're not going to disagree.

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,362
That is the point of the Pickle Party,
we're very aligned on these issues.

263
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:16,231
Charlie, you can't just
start your own party.

264
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,634
You got to talk to people about...
Yes, you can.

265
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:19,301
You can?

266
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,537
If you're not as educated or as
informed, what you do is you

267
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,406
start your own party and
you yell the loudest.

268
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,341
We want attention!

269
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:26,844
Okay, all right, yeah, sure.

270
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,179
No, you're the Pickle Party.

271
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,215
Great. Okay, so let's just
accept that and move on.

272
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,884
Yes, Frank, move on.

273
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,851
Reason will prevail.

274
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:34,886
Pickles will prevail!

275
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:40,559
Okay, well, the next issue on our
list should be a pretty easy

276
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:44,863
one for the Pickle
Party to agree on.

277
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,598
"A crucifix in the bar."

278
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,334
Ah, you are right,
this is an easy one.

279
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,570
Why wouldn't we have a
crucifix in the bar?

280
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:52,504
'Cause we're a bar.

281
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:55,374
Right, but we're an
Irish Catholic bar.

282
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,409
We're an Irish bar.

283
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,478
Yeah, Irish Catholic bar, and
therefore a giant wooden

284
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,414
crucifix is a celebration
or our heritage.

285
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,414
Giant?

286
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,415
Yeah.

287
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,418
How big of a crucifix
do you want?

288
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,053
Big. It should be the
centerpiece of the whole room.

289
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:09,889
I mean, it should dominate
every conversation.

290
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,523
That's gonna be terrifying!

291
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,558
It should be terrifying.

292
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,559
That's how you know God
loves you, Charlie.

293
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:19,165
I don't want a giant bloody man in the
bar scaring the customers, and most

294
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,032
importantly, me!

295
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,033
You see that, Frank?

296
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:21,901
I saw it.

297
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,070
I just played them
like a fiddle.

298
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:24,871
A goddamn fiddle.

299
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:25,738
What do you want?

300
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,440
I want in on the action.

301
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:31,911
Whatever it is that you got going on
around here, I want a piece of it, okay?

302
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:36,215
You see, Frank, you might not
know this, but you need me.

303
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,718
People don't trust you, Frank.

304
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,389
You're a piece of shit and
you're ugly and you ooze sleaze

305
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,623
and you're very, very ugly.

306
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,959
All right, I'm gonna
make you my puppet.

307
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,094
Right here.

308
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:48,928
Puppet.

309
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,131
Look, I've been cooking the
books in the bar for years.

310
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,065
I faking knew it.

311
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,835
I mean, all kinds of avenues
and shell corporations.

312
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:57,071
It's all fake and
it's all in here.

313
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,172
Let me see.

314
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:59,073
Check it out right there.

315
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,308
Oh, man, holy shit.

316
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,243
What, what is this one?

317
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:02,943
"Wolf Cola"?

318
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,245
Wolf Cola, that's a
bogus soda distributor.

319
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,747
I made it up. It's fake!

320
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:12,985
Look, the whole idea is the more
corporations that you can plant offshore...

321
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:13,686
Right.

322
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,755
...the more money
you can rake in.

323
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:18,591
Da-da-da! I don't care about any
of these details, but I like

324
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:19,491
these figures I'm seeing.

325
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:22,061
All right, I'll be the puppet
and do my dance, and you can

326
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,529
keep the goddamn
details to yourself.

327
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:28,368
Uh! I don't think I hear
any arguing out there.

328
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,974
So we can have the crucifix, but it
needs to be in the back of the bar.

329
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:36,043
See? I can live with that.

330
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,946
That's a compromise
right there, man.

331
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,682
All right!
Pickle Party compromise!

332
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:43,018
Huh-huh-huh!
Tasteful crucifix party.

333
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,786
Hey-hey-hey, all right!

334
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,021
Sounds like you guys
came to a compromise.

335
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,724
That's great. We cross the
crucifix issue off the list.

336
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,393
One quick question
before I do, though.

337
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,295
How bloody is this guy gonna be?

338
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,162
Not bloody at all.

339
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,130
Very bloody.

340
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:55,730
What?

341
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:57,166
He's gotta be drenched in blood.

342
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,133
I mean, covered in blood.

343
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,735
Why?

344
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:00,736
Well, that's the whole point.

345
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,370
You need to see the
wounds of Christ.

346
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:03,371
He needs to be ravaged.

347
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,440
Oh, God, dude, it's bad enough
I'm gonna let you put the

348
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,842
stupid cross up in the first first place...
Stupid cross?!

349
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:08,843
You son of a bitch, I knew it!

350
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:09,844
I knew it! I knew it!

351
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:10,844
Don't make fun!

352
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:11,845
That's the whole point!

353
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:12,846
Do it peaceful-like!

354
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:13,747
It's a massacre!

355
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:14,848
There's nothing peaceful.

356
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,584
I don't want to
look at a massacre!

357
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:24,158
So, according to our records,
you are claiming a dependent

358
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,229
for which you have no
official documentation.

359
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,899
Yes?

360
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,407
Are you okay?

361
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,209
You're sweating profusely.

362
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:46,083
Oh, no, yes, yes, I, um,
I'm just very worried.

363
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:50,021
You know, the babysitters were
supposed to bring the baby back

364
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:53,591
by 3:00, and where are you?

365
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:55,192
Where are you guys?

366
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:56,193
I understand.

367
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,194
Crying baby!

368
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,195
Crying baby here!

369
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,196
Oh, my God.

370
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,130
There's my sweet baby.

371
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,066
Excuse me, won't you?

372
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,300
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,236
You guys, you found a baby!

374
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:07,471
Where did you find a baby?

375
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,607
Oh, you guys, I love you so much.
Where...?

376
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,609
Okay, Dee, which crucifix
do you find more tasteful?

377
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:15,278
Are out of your goddamn minds?

378
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,279
What is this? Where's the baby?

379
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:19,315
Do you really want a kidnapping on top
of all the other shit you got going on

380
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,116
right now?

381
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,650
We had a plan! We had a plan!

382
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,086
She's totally buying it, okay?

383
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:24,120
Come on. Make a decision.

384
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,120
Yeah, but for how long?

385
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,789
She could be out
there for for hours.

386
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,924
And I have to produce
a real baby!

387
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:31,927
Stop thinking about your problems and
start thinking about our problems.

388
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,263
Dee, calm down, calm down.

389
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:35,264
You are so emotional right now.

390
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,265
And so wet, too.

391
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,101
Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill you.

392
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:40,103
Okay, okay, just shut up for
a second, let me think.

393
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,938
All right, yes, go to the bar.

394
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,574
That'll get me out of here and buy me
some time to get this bitch off my balls.

395
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,676
Bye!

396
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,177
Very, very sick baby.

397
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:48,945
Very sick baby!

398
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,980
It's so sad when they don't
feel well, isn't it?

399
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:52,648
Lock up, won't you,
on your way out?

400
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,423
And let's definitely reschedule.

401
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:56,119
Let's do. Shh!

402
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:02,465
Hey, yeah, so I was thinking
about my title, because I think

403
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,568
it should be "Vice President
of Worldwide Disibution."

404
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,569
But you don't need a title.

405
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:10,573
What I need you to do for the next three
weeks is to deflect Mac and Charlie.

406
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:11,207
That's easy.

407
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,108
I can do that, Frank.

408
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,142
That's what I'm good at.

409
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,411
But I am gonna need a business
card, 'cause I want to be able

410
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,914
to hand that shit to people, so they
know that I am in a place of power.

411
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,049
It's not important.

412
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,217
It's important to me, Frank!

413
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,986
And I know that what's important
to you is money and power, but I

414
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,656
want real power, because
with real power comes real

415
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,291
responsibility, and I don't
want any of that shit.

416
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,926
I just want the money.

417
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,796
And the illusion of power.

418
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:36,898
And puss.

419
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,565
What?

420
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,866
Hell, I don't know, Frank.

421
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:39,701
I don't know, man.

422
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:40,335
What?

423
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,304
Tell me, tell me.

424
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:44,573
I need something.

425
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:50,047
I mean, I got this, uh...
this giant gaping hole inside me.

426
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:50,948
Oh.

427
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,821
And I'm-I'm always trying
to fill it with something.

428
00:14:56,823 --> 00:15:00,592
I like to call it my,
uh, my God hole.

429
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:01,126
Oh.

430
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:05,497
And I think a lot of people in this
world, they-they fill it with religion.

431
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:06,765
But I don't believe in God.

432
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:09,000
But you want to
fill it with pussy.

433
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,068
Yeah.

434
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,669
Yo!

435
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,671
Hey, Dennis and Frank, you here?

436
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:13,772
Yeah, oh, oh!

437
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:17,008
Good. Guys, we got to help Dee
with her tax audit situation.

438
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,644
So, Dennis, please, if you
could take the floor.

439
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,146
W-Wait, wait.

440
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,747
What tax audit situation?

441
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,481
Oh, right.

442
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:25,786
Okay, so Dee's baby scheme blew up in
her face and now she's getting audited.

443
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,388
Deandra, did you tell
the IRS you work here?

444
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,256
Of course I did.

445
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,559
We can't have the IRS
looking around our books.

446
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:32,126
Why?

447
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:33,060
What's wrong with our books?

448
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:33,894
Let me step in here.

449
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:36,897
Um, I think what you're trying
to say is that the IRS poking

450
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,766
around our bar business
is no good for anyone.

451
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:43,371
Look, it's gonna be best for all of
us to get the IRS off of Dee's back.

452
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,072
Okay.

453
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:47,909
So, as the only rational and
emotionless person here, I'm

454
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:49,644
gonna tell you guys
what we need to do.

455
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:54,114
See, you've all been trying to convince
the IRS that Dee's baby is alive.

456
00:15:54,116 --> 00:16:00,621
What you really need to be doing is
convincing the IRS that Dee's baby is dead.

457
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,068
This is dark.

458
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,936
Darkest thing we've ever done.

459
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,306
Mm-hmm.

460
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,245
Oh. Hello.

461
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm looking for Dee Reynolds.

462
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,814
Yes.

463
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,483
Won't you have a seat please?

464
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,851
What's going on?

465
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:26,852
Baby croaked.

466
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,489
Oh, yes.

467
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,359
Oh, my God.

468
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,627
This is insane, right?

469
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:34,528
Mm-hmm.

470
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,863
I mean, this definitely feels like
emotion trumping reason, correct?

471
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:38,430
Yep.

472
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:42,434
Also, dude, I'm sorry, but is
this the size you had in mind?

473
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,702
Yes.

474
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:44,636
It's too big.

475
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:45,604
It's not too big.

476
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,240
You should just be happy I
didn't spray it down yet.

477
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,008
No, you're not getting
any more blood.

478
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,009
That's it.

479
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,811
"He was my sweet angel..."

480
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:53,778
All right, Dee, here we go.

481
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,812
It's showtime. Are you ready?

482
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay, I have a couple questions.

483
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:56,581
Yeah?

484
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,515
I'm getting nervous, Dennis,
'cause I don't think I can do

485
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,216
the speech that you wrote.

486
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,118
Let me hear some of it.

487
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,420
Okay, and this is the thing, I-I
can't, I can't cry on command.

488
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,323
Jesus Christ, Dee.

489
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:07,026
I mean, how are you planning
on becoming an actress at all?

490
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,796
You can't make people laugh, 'cause you're
not funny, you can't cry on command.

491
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:10,596
What can you do?

492
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:13,967
I-I can try harder, but it's just that...
All right, well, the good

493
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,970
news is I anticipated this, so I brought...
What's that?

494
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,471
...a bit of chili powder.

495
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:21,375
I'm gonna blow this directly into
your eyes, and trust me, you'll cry.

496
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,609
Okay, is that safe though?

497
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,176
Is this...?

498
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,878
Well, it's, you know,
it's safe enough.

499
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,079
Let's give it a try, shall we?

500
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,014
No, no, no, no, no, no!

501
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:28,849
Shh-shh-shh.

502
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,916
Oh, shit!

503
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:30,684
Oh!

504
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:31,684
Shh-shh-shh.

505
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:32,519
Okay, listen, listen, listen.

506
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:33,653
Save it, save it!

507
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:34,454
We're starting.

508
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:35,155
Ready?

509
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:35,922
We're starting, Dee.

510
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:36,457
Break a leg.

511
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,361
Oh.

512
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:47,202
It's really heavy.

513
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,370
What did Frank put in there?

514
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:49,572
The urinal rocks.

515
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:50,239
Oh.

516
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,240
Coming in handy, huh?

517
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:51,740
Yeah.

518
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:56,946
Oh, this is a very sad day for
the entire Paddy's Pub family.

519
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:57,747
Mm-hmm.

520
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:04,120
At times like this, I-I like to quench
my thirst with a delicious Wolf Cola.

521
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,361
There's nothing like that...
to wash away the sorrow.

522
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:12,895
Hear, hear.

523
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:13,930
That's my bit.

524
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:17,701
Now it's time for the
grieving mother.

525
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:20,070
Uh... oh.

526
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,271
Hello, everyone.

527
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,539
Ah, God.

528
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,708
Thank you so much for coming.

529
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,512
It's such a sad day, isn't it?

530
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:30,748
Oh, little Barney.

531
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,518
You were my special angel.

532
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,886
And only angels can fly.

533
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,055
Good God. Sorry.

534
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:36,789
Sob.

535
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,323
Sob, you bitch.

536
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,160
Oh, it hurts!

537
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,829
God, it hurts!

538
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,096
The pain inside.

539
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,297
God, it hurts so bad.

540
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:47,998
Okay.

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,866
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

542
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:49,433
That's enough.

543
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay, Dee.

544
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,035
I'm sorry, I just...

545
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:52,969
Are my eyes bleeding?

546
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:54,437
Oh, my God, is there blood?

547
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,238
Okay. Oh!

548
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,871
Is there blood?!

549
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:56,939
You son of a bitch!

550
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,273
Wow.

551
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,541
Heavy stuff, guys.

552
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:02,211
Heavy stuff, heavy
subject matter.

553
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:07,016
Anyway, uh, Barney,
you died too young.

554
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:09,418
Before you could walk.

555
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,521
Before you could talk.

556
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:15,725
And before you had the chance
to get together the proper

557
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:21,363
paperwork, all that paperwork that you
need to prove-- Oh, thank you so much.

558
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:24,131
Wolf Cola, everyone.

559
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,601
It's the right
cola for closure.

560
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:30,004
Let's talk about closure, 'cause that...
Can I talk to you for a second?

561
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,538
Yeah.

562
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,740
Dude, something stinks.

563
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,941
I know, I know.

564
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,377
Have you noticed that all we wanted to
do was talk about our money... Right.

565
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,646
...and then we kept getting pushed
into talking about other things?

566
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:42,416
And then when we leave, Frank and
Dennis became all buddy-buddy.

567
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:45,519
Yeah, there were a lot of backroom
dealings going on in here, you know?

568
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,254
What the hell is this?

569
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:51,292
"Dennis Reynolds, Executive Vice
President of Worldwide Distribution.

570
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,761
Wolf Cola."

571
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,029
What the hell, dude?

572
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,231
See, now I'm getting pissed off,
you know, 'cause I think those

573
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,066
two are conspiring against us.

574
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,769
Let's go out there and expose these
sons of bitches for who they are.

575
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:04,805
And the most important thing to
remember is that this whole

576
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,840
thing is over, right?

577
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:07,541
Dead.

578
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:10,142
Every single person in
this room has to move on.

579
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:11,911
That's excellent.

580
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:12,978
Excellent, Dennis.

581
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,979
Thank you, thank you.

582
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,649
Now, we would like to pay our
respects to the dead baby.

583
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:21,019
And in the Christian tradition,
we're gonna open up the casket

584
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,087
to take one last look
at his tiny corpse.

585
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,021
You don't want to do that.

586
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,156
What is happening?

587
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,359
This is what you get when you
mess with the Pickle Party.

588
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:28,093
Pickle Party.

589
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,996
Prepare for your hearts
to turn to stones!

590
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,531
God.

591
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,333
What the hell is that?!

592
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,369
It's the dead dog
from the alleyway.

593
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,671
I was compromising.

594
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,640
I figured we'd give
it a proper burial.

595
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,407
Okay.

596
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,978
Well, I'm done here.

597
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,280
Well, I'll tell you what.

598
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,650
Dee's definitely going
down in this audit.

599
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,318
I think we're all
going down, Charlie.

600
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,923
Okay, you know what, here-- let's
vote on something once and for all.

601
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,926
Everybody in favor of Frank not
making all of the decisions in

602
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:02,061
the bar anymore,
raise your hands.

603
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,062
Great, that's settled.

604
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:04,062
Even he's on board.

605
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:07,665
Okay, and finally, all in favor
of going back to the old system

606
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,802
of organized chaos, where
emotion trumps reason every

607
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,004
single time and we just yell at
each other to get the shit that

608
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,038
we want, raise your hands.

609
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,406
Fantastic!

610
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,609
I've got a few things I'd like to
yell about now, so we can all start.

611
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,676
My eyes! My eyes!

612
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,845
You opened the casket!

613
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:34,612
