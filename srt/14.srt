00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,103
[ charlie ]
I think what mac's
trying to say...

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,105
Is that it's probably
the greatest movie
of all time.

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,973
<i>[ dennis ]</i>
<i>that's 'cause it is.</i>

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,541
<i>Rocky iv</i> is not
the greatest movie
of all time.

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,076
Dee, what do you consider
to be a good movie?

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,379
I don't know, like,
<i>million dollar baby--</i>
<i>oh, come on.</i>

7
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,016
Are you kidding me?
That is ridiculous.
Come on. It won an oscar.

8
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,018
<i>Rocky iv</i>
<i>has stallone in it,</i>

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,153
And he bashes
a russian's face
to all smithereens.

10
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,889
Lifting anvils and shit,
and pulling trucks
through the snow.

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,891
<i>Million dollar baby</i>
<i>is totally unrealistic.</i>

12
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,960
Girls can't fight.
They don't have muscles.
It's true.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,562
Okay, that is
a horribly sexist
thing to say.

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,564
It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.

15
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,566
Girls can't
pull trucks
through snow.

16
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,602
Can you pull
trucks through snow?
I absolutely could.

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,771
You can barely walk
in the snow.
[ man ] excuse me.

18
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,106
Time out.
Is the truck
parked in neutral?

19
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,676
- hey!
- what, dude?

20
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,445
Empty your pockets.

21
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,182
Now.
Okay.

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,686
Hey, let's just all
stay calm.
[ groans ]

23
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,593
Nice friends.

24
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:37,262
Maybe... One to two
inches of snow?

25
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,299
One to two inches--
and a ford f-150.

26
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,135
Right. In park,
but no emergency brake.

27
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,271
Maybe I could pull it
four feet.

28
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,775
I'd give him four feet.
I'd give him five.
What's with the gym bag?

29
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,578
Just got back from
a "boxercise" class
at the gym.

30
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,015
"boxercise"? What kind
of queer shit is that?

31
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:00,552
- I'm learning self-defense.
- you wanna learn self-defense,
you come to daddy.

32
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,856
I mean, all during the '60s,
before I met my whore wife,
I was a boxer.

33
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,858
They called me
frankie fast hands.

34
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,761
Frankie fast hands, everybody.
Yeah, keep livin'
in the past, dad.

35
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,498
Is this about that stupid
<i>million dollar baby</i>
<i>movie, dee?</i>

36
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,733
No, actually, mac,
it's about being left
with a mugger...

37
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,036
Because my chickenshit brother
and his friends ditched me.

38
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,138
- you ditched your sister?
- absolutely.

39
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,140
With a mugger--
the guy had a knife.

40
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,442
Of course we did.
What were we supposed to do?

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,311
If I was there,
I would have used
my frankie fast hands technique.

42
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,647
Technique don't mean
shit out on the streets.
Guys have knives.

43
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,550
Yeah. In boxing, there
are rules. On the streets,
we ain't got no rules.

44
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,552
[ together ]
ain't no rules
out on the streets.

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,722
- you guys got no rules
on the streets, you.
- <i>oh, please.</i>

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,757
Will you stop talking
about the streets,

47
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,793
You three jackasses,
like you've been there?

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,731
I mean, any underground
street fight in philadelphia,
you'd find tons of technique.

49
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,368
- you think you could teach me?
- in a month I'll have you
kicking all their asses.

50
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,470
<i>Right. See you then.</i>

51
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,539
Dennis, I have
an idea.

52
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,008
[ shouting, chattering ]

53
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,181
Well, this is awesome.
Yeah. This is amazing.

54
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,183
There's blood everywhere.
It's beautiful.

55
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,719
Yeah, and we were totally right.
These guys don't have technique.

56
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,822
They get all cranked up
like animals and beat
the christ out of each other.

57
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,824
Look at all this money
being thrown around.

58
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,194
Dude, we gotta get in on this.
Oh, yeah.

59
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,696
Really, I think it's about who
can take the biggest beating.
Yeah.

60
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,432
[ man ]
get up!

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,434
You know who can take
a really good beating?

62
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,936
Charlie.
Charlie.

63
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,374
Here she is--
the old gym.

64
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,376
[ sniffing ]
smell that?

65
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,612
That's the smell
of hard work.
And feet.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,383
That's the smell
of big dreams.
The smell of glory.

67
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,619
It smells like feet.
And feet.
Does smell like feet.

68
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,288
Frank?
Oh, shit.

69
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,424
Frankie fast hands!

70
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,794
- [ chuckles ]
- holy crap. I knew it was you.
I haven't seen you in years.

71
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:52,398
Hey-hey-hey,
frankie, it's me.
Bobby thunderson.

72
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,566
Yes. Yes. Yes, bobby.
Look at you!

73
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,102
You... Really
let yourself go.

74
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,805
Oh-oh, are you trying
to get back into
fighting form?

75
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,475
No, I'm actually, uh,
teaching my daughter
some self-defense.

76
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,178
<i>Holy-- holy shit, man.</i>
<i>I'm training my</i>
<i>daughter too.</i>

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,915
Hey, what do you know?
Hey, look at her.
Look at her over there.

78
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,052
<i>Look, look, look.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

79
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,320
<i>Amazing.</i>
<i>Hey, she's pretty</i>
<i>too, huh?</i>

80
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,756
Like her old man, huh?
[ chuckling ]

81
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,992
Well, it's really nice
seeing you, bob.
Yeah.

82
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,261
Hey, don't listen
to everything
this guy tells you.

83
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,830
You don't wanna get knocked
out in the first round.
[ cackling ]

84
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,466
Oh, my god, that's
an annoying sound he makes.

85
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,768
Ass... Hole.
Yeah, asshole.

86
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,604
Okay, don't listen
to anything he says.
He's a real creep.

87
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,307
All right, now.
Here, we're gonna
start weight training.

88
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,143
First things first--
squats.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,748
Okay. That's it.

90
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,750
Uh, that looks
really heavy.

91
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,353
Look. This is not gonna be
a half-assed workout.

92
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,588
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.

93
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,859
Yeah, but I can't lift that.
Just position yourself under
the bar and listen to me.

94
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,862
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all
the weight on your neck.

95
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,333
Then you're gonna
jam your legs down
and hyperextend your ankles,

96
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,803
And then shoot back up
and lock your knees
in place.

97
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,208
Not one of those things
sounds right to me
at all.

98
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,909
Look. You wanna fight
like a man?

99
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,546
You gotta train like a man.
Now, come on.
Gimme a squat.

100
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,249
Ready. Go!
[ groaning ]
oh, my god!

101
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,318
Go. Keep it up.
Daddy, I can't.

102
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,087
It's-- I can't.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

103
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,192
At least I got the one.
Right?

104
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,261
Yeah. Get out, get out,
get out.

105
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,233
We got a lot
of work to do.

106
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,069
[ charlie groaning ]
[ mac ]
good, good.

107
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,071
Ah!
Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,473
[ moans ]
what are we doing?

109
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,575
Charlie, you're, like,
the toughest guy we know.

110
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,778
Yeah?
So nobody can
kick your ass, right?

111
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,780
Practically invincible.
Yeah.

112
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,782
Yeah, what's
your point though?

113
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,984
Well-- so here's
what's gonna happen, pal.

114
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,553
Dennis and I
are gonna train you...

115
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,056
To be an underground
street fighter.

116
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,124
[ laughing ]
what? That is brilliant.

117
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,827
Yeah, it is.
Okay, what's
the first step?

118
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,730
First step is getting
that shirt off.
Yeah, let's get that shirt off.

119
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,333
Why would I do that?
That shirt's just gonna
weigh you down.

120
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,368
Yeah, and rocky never
wears a shirt when
he trains,

121
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,670
So let's just go ahead
and rip that bad boy off.

122
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,440
I think I'm gonna wear it.

123
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,176
That's ridiculous.
You can't train
and wear a shirt, dude.

124
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,012
Now it's becoming
this whole big thing.
It feels a little gay.

125
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,181
It's not gay.
Just take your shirt off.
It's not gay.

126
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:26,251
Why can't I just get, like,
all excited and passionately
rip it off in the moment?

127
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,955
Why can't you just
take your shirt off for us?
Just drop it for now.

128
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,257
All right, all right.
Uh, maybe you should
punch something.

129
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,760
There you go.
Yeah, you should
punch something--

130
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,729
Why don't you punch this board?

131
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,964
Okay. Hold it
steady for me.

132
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,200
Watch your eyes.
All right, come on.

133
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,202
[ groaning ]
oh!

134
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,637
<i>Oh, that's--</i>
<i>[ groaning ]</i>

135
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,940
That looks like
it stings.
Oh, my god.

136
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,343
What's that made out of?
It's a board, so it's,
you know, made out of wood.

137
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,612
It's, like, particle board.
It's, like, harder
than wood, dude.

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,614
No.
It's actually
softer than wood.

139
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,017
Yeah, it's a lot
softer than wood.
Petrified wood.

140
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,119
What happened, man?
I thought you were--
I don't know.

141
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,221
I wasn't drunk enough.
You should be drunk for this.

142
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,590
We should all
be drunk for this.
Let's get really drunk.

143
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,692
All right.
Yeah. You know what?
I'll get some beers.

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,627
Come with me.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

145
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,696
Let him go.

146
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,802
Mmm.
I don't know
what happened.

147
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,272
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.

148
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,911
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Deandra,
we've been at this
for days now.

149
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,247
It's like you have
no motor skills.

150
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,317
Just grab that bar
and jerk it down
behind your neck.

151
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,787
Hey! How's the chip
off the old block doin'?

152
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,757
Bobby, not now, okay?
Hey, your old man ever tell you
how we fought back in '61?

153
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,927
They billed it as
"beauty versus the beast."
[ cackles ]

154
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,063
Wasn't much of a fight.
First-round knockout.

155
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,298
[ blows raspberries ]
he went down like a--
wait, wait, wait.

156
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,767
Hold on a second.
What's goin' on
with you, thunderson?

157
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,836
What, are you trying
to humiliate me?

158
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,605
Uh, I think you did that
to yourself 40 years ago.

159
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,275
You know damn well
you hit me after
the bell.

160
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,378
That was a cheap shot.
What are you-- you know,
excuses are like assholes.

161
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,380
Everybody's got one,
and they all stink.

162
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,882
Oh, yeah? You wanna go
at it right now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

163
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,085
You wanna
settle this now?
Let's do it right here.

164
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,087
Let's settle
this son of a bitch
right here.

165
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,156
Hey, hey. Take it easy here.
Jesus. Show a little class,
will ya?

166
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,059
Geez. Look, I'm an old man.
I don't fight no more.

167
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,228
I let my daughter
do my fighting for me.

168
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,231
And maybe in
a couple years, when
this little graham cracker...

169
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,001
Might have the stuff to compete,
maybe we'll see.

170
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,837
Wait. You know what, asshole?
Why don't you go to hell?

171
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,841
Dee, stay out of this.
No. This guy has been
all over us since we walked in.

172
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,843
I tell you what, jerk.
Why don't you take
you big mouth,

173
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,845
And go someplace else
with it?

174
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,414
Listen, little buttercup,
I'm just bustin'
your old man's balls.

175
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,083
You don't have to get
your panties in an uproar.
Oh, my god.

176
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,419
Are you standing there?
Come on, move.

177
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,756
That guy is such an asshole.
Don't blame it on him.

178
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,593
You're not makin' any progress.
I'm goin' to get
the jump rope.

179
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,899
- men are such pricks.
- oh, tell me about it.

180
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,635
I bet you're real tired
of them pushing you around.

181
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,637
Oh, god,
you have no idea.

182
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,206
If only there was a way
that you could be...

183
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,410
Physically tough enough
to intimidate men.

184
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,012
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

185
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,749
Let's just say I provide
a much-needed service
around this place.

186
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:14,753
Step into the shadows
and, uh, we'll talk.

187
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,490
<i>[ knocking ]</i>
<i>yeah?</i>

188
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,894
<i>[ mac ]</i>
<i>mac and dennis, dude.</i>
<i>Open the door.</i>

189
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,830
What?
<i>It's mac and dennis.</i>
<i>Open the door.</i>

190
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,832
<i>[ dennis ]</i>
<i>open the door, bro.</i>

191
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,034
All right, guys.
Hang on a second.
It's like, uh--

192
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,570
It's like 11:00
in the morning here.

193
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,572
<i>We don't care.</i>
<i>Open the door.</i>
<i>Surprise, bitch.</i>

194
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,143
- [ laughing, chattering ]
- you're hittin' me with that?

195
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,279
Charlie, let's be honest.
Punching boards
isn't your thing.

196
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,581
But that's okay.
Yes, that's okay,
because for you...

197
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,750
It's not gonna be about
inflicting punishment,

198
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,653
It's gonna be about
having punishment
inflicted upon you.

199
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,155
We need to smash things
all over your body.
Yes!

200
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,157
No.
Yes.

201
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,693
We need to build up
your tolerance to beatings.
Hence the smashing.

202
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,963
We used a trash can, but
dennis wanted to use a chair.
I think he's ready.

203
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,065
- that's way too excessive
at this point.
- that guy's ready.

204
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,234
He's not ready for a chair.
I'm tellin' you,
he's ready.

205
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,737
Hey! Guys!
I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.

206
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,239
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him
all worked up.

207
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,075
He's the toughest
guy we know.
Yes, he is, but he--

208
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,845
Hey, mac!
Get a chair,
smash it on my back.

209
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,581
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right
attitude.

210
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,952
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>Charlie, go put on</i>
<i>those little short-shorts.</i>

211
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,954
Let's take things
to the next level.
Yeah.

212
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,623
But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
Let's get drunk!

213
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,291
[ whooping, laughing ]

214
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,428
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoo!

215
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,498
[ cheering ]
drink this. Drink this.

216
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,004
Now, just to be clear,
these aren't steroids, right?

217
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,006
No, no, no, no.
Of course not.

218
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,776
These are
performance-enhancing
supplements.

219
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,712
Okay, so how long before
I start to notice something?

220
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,548
This is the good stuff.
You'll feel it
almost immediately.

221
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,885
But I should warn you,
you may experience
some mood swings,

222
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,887
Some irrational thinking
here and there,

223
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,656
But it is
nothing compared
to the long-term effects.

224
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,527
Which are what?
You ever punched a guy so hard
in the eye he swallowed it?

225
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,463
I'll get some water.

226
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,499
How you feel, man?
You drunk?
Yeah. I'm pretty wasted.

227
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,035
Great. So what
do we smash first?
I wanna smash a crate.

228
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,237
- yeah, a crate on his back.
- why don't you punch me?

229
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,306
Punch you?
Punch you?
What?

230
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,575
I'm probably
gonna get punched a lot
in the tournament, right?

231
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,577
Yeah. All right.
Okay, that's a good point.

232
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,746
Let's punch him.
Pop that shirt off,
and we'll start punching.

233
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,848
Oh, my god. Really?
Yeah, man.

234
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,418
- every time I'm gonna take--
- [ chattering ]

235
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,420
Why can't you just
take it off?
Just take it off.

236
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,656
- you're ruining the moment.
- what is with you
and the moment?

237
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,224
You know what?
Forget it. Forget it.

238
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,226
Who do you want
to punch you first?
I don't care.

239
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,001
- that was good.
- well, you caught me
off guard.

240
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,870
[ groans ]
[ laughs ]
that was a big part of it.

241
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,207
That was the same spot.
The same, exact spot.
<i>Yeah.</i>

242
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,275
Charlie, if we
keep this up,
you're gonna be...

243
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,344
The best underground
street fighter ever, bro.

244
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,048
Okay. Okay. Deandra.
Just 10 more minutes.

245
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,218
No, no. That's it.
Dee, that's--
I love it. I need more of it.

246
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,220
It's dangerous.
Enough. Enough.

247
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,590
Come on, what the hell
has gotten into you
the last couple of days?

248
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,692
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

249
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,361
You think I can't
do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?

250
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,763
"on something"?
Yeah.

251
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,032
I never said
you were on something.
Then don't. Don't start.

252
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,768
Hey, now we're talkin' here.
She's a killer.

253
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,403
You're goddamn right
I'm a killer.

254
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,872
You look like a holocaust victim
in pageant makeup.

255
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,574
- I will eat your babies, bitch.
- bring it!

256
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,577
- nobody's eating babies.
- hey, you lookin'
to spar, little girl?

257
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,613
No. No fight.
She's not ready.
Oh, I'm ready.

258
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,915
No, you're not ready.
I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.

259
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,551
- what about next Friday, huh?
- yeah. How's Friday?

260
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,887
- you're crazy.
- how's Friday to you?

261
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,789
What's the matter,
"frankie fat hands"?

262
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,291
- you're afraid she's gonna get
knocked out just like you did?
- hey!

263
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,093
Get this lion off of me here.
No!

264
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,762
No! You stop it.
This is my fight.
Do you understand me?

265
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,598
I'm sick of men
getting in my way.
This is my fight. You hear me?

266
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,735
- you hear what I'm saying?
- maybe we should leave
these two alone, huh?

267
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,404
<i>Okay. We'll see you</i>
<i>next Friday, huh?</i>

268
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,873
"beauty versus
the beast ii."
[ cackling ]

269
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,676
Come on, brianna.
Here we go.

270
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,179
You're not ready
for this fight.
Oh, I have an idea, dad.

271
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,016
Why don't you shut
your fat little monkey face
and hold the bag?

272
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,320
I'm gonna paralyze this bitch.

273
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,859
[ man ]
 try to be best
'cause you're only a man 

274
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,462
 and a man's got to learn
to take it 

275
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,831
 try to believe
though the going gets rough 

276
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,834
 that you gotta hang tough
to make it 

277
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:26,105
 history repeats itself
try and you succeed 

278
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,041
 never doubt
that you're the one 

279
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,944
 and you can have your dream 

280
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,313
 you're the best
around 

281
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,382
 nothing's gonna ever
keep you down 

282
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,318
 you're the best
around 

283
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,121
 and nothing's gonna ever
keep you down

'cause your life will depend

 on the strength
that you have inside you

 oh, gotta be proud
standin' out on the cloud

 when the odds in the game
defy you 

291

 try your best
to win them all 

292

 and one day
time will tell

308
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,490
Yes, dad, I know the fight
is in a few hours,
all right?

309
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,259
I'm trying to find
my goddamn headband.
Is that okay?

310
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,363
Is it okay with you
if I find my headband
before I come down there?

311
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,531
Is that all right
with you, dad?
Jesus!

312
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,633
Why didn't we get
the orange one
like I said?

313
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,636
This one might as well
be goddamn camouflaged!

314
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,639
Oh, good.
Are you happy now?

315
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,075
I just punched a hole
in my wall!

316
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,578
[ sobbing ]

317
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,083
Are you sure
you're okay, dude?

318
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,085
[ whining ]
no, I'm not.

319
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,488
I start thinking, you know,
and it makes--

320
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,424
[ growls ]
it makes me so angry.

<i>[ laughing ]</i>

What am I saying?

323
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,833
Okay. Were gonna go--

324
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,136
We're gonna go sign you up
for the fight.

325
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,438
- yes!
- and you stay here
and eat your eggs.

326
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:42,341
Have the-- have--
make sure you eat
some of the sandwich.

327
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,511
- <i>yeah, you can just meet us</i>
<i>down there, all right?</i>
<i>- can you meet us later?</i>

328
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,981
Meet you later?
Can I meet you later?

329
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,450
- are you gonna meet us?
- yes, I'm gonna meet you
there later!

330
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,452
All right.

All right, sign here,
here and here.

334
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,803
And what is this?

335
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,107
These are waiver forms
in case your fighter is
seriously injured... Or killed.

336
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh, we don't care
about that.
Sign away.

337
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,145
What's the, uh,
fighter's name?
Clown baby.

338
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,015
- clown ba-- clown baby?
- yeah.

339
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,985
- you mean like a baby clown?
- not a baby clown.
A clown ba--

340
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,621
It's like a baby--
it's like a clown
that is a baby.

341
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,492
I said cl-- clown baby.
Mm-mmm. You said baby clown.

342
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,494
- I don't even care.
- yep.

343
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,464
"clown baby"?
What in the hell kind
of a name is clown baby?

344
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,333
Bro, it's perfect.
Nobody's gonna bet
on a guy named clown baby.

345
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,835
He's gonna be a huge underdog.

346
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,672
Which means we stand to make
even more money off him.
Exactly.

347
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,808
Oh, that's brilliant.
Hey, pal, 500 bucks
on clown baby.

348
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,311
Oh, dennis. 500?
That's all we got, dude.

349
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,015
You saw charlie.
We turned that kid
into an animal.

350
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,855
Oh, yeah? Call me
a holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?

351
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,990
Okay, maybe that part
might be a little bit true.

352
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,093
We'll see how pretty you are
as soon as I punch
a hole in your--

353
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,095
Wha--

354
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,097
Where the he--

355
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,433
Who took my shit?

356
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,435
I might have
had some.

357
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,571
What did you just say,
you little bitch?

358
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,109
I might have had some
of your pills or whatever.

359
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,150
Oh, yeah?

360
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,553
I am gonna punch a hole
through your face.

361
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,022
I'd like to
see you try that.

362
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,324
Yeah?
[ table rattling ]

363
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,400
Ooh, you're gonna die!
Oh, I am gonna
rip your face off--

364
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:52,204
You're gonna die!
Make a shirt out of it,
and I'm gonna wear it.

365
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,909
I'm gonna take one second
to take my shirt off,
and then you're gonna die!

366
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,844

<i>What the--</i>
<i>hey, listen, lady.</i>

You wanna beat up
on your little boyfriend,
you go do it somewhere else.

369
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,554
Watch the car.

Dude, where the hell
is your fighter?
He'll be here.

372
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,069
He'll be here when?
Soon!

373
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:27,373
Okay, you have five minutes
to put a fighter in that ring.
Okay.

374
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,908
[ mouthing words ]
just got off the phone
with charlie.

Well, where is he?
He's in jail with dee.

376
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,446
What?
Apparently they got all hopped
up on amphetamines...

377
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,615
And beat the shit
out of some guy
in front of the bar.

378
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,418
Amphetamines?
Yeah, like, steroids
or something. I don't know.

379
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,920
Damn it, charlie.
Look at the dude
he was supposed to fight.

380
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,623
He's the scrawniest--
I know! Charlie would
have killed that guy.

381
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,791
We're gonna miss out
on all this money.

382
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,826
Anybody could kick
that guy's ass.
I know.

383
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:51,363
Come on. You could kick--
you-you could kick
that guy's ass.

384
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,465
You think?

385
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,702
Oh, my god. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, you're, like, the second
toughest guy I know.

386
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,103
I did bash charlie good
a couple times.

387
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,471
You almost hurt him once.
With the bottle?

388
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,073
Yeah, and that's next
to impossible.
That was good.

389
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,008
You're-- you're good.
I am good.

Yeah.

Tell you what. Um--
why don't you go stretch out.

392
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,084
I'll talk to the bookie
and let him know
that clown baby...

00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,161
- frankie, what's the deal?
- she got arrested.

397
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:26,165
Ah! I knew that skinny bitch
would chicken out.
So we'll never get the fight.

398
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,667
That's a shame, frankie.
Lot of unanswered questions.

399
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,571
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
You and me, right now.

What? Daddy, you can beat him.
Come on.

- it'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.

I will knock your nose
off your face.

You wanna knock something,
you knock it off of me.

404

That's right.
All right,
you got a fight.

405
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,985
Greg, get my gloves.

406
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,521
I'm sorry, bro.
Yeah, well, sorry's not
gonna get our money back.

407
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,991
He was so fast.
You should have moved around
a little more and tired him out.

408
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,060
We have nothing.
I don't know
what to say.

409
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,497
I gave it my best.
Yeah. You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.

410
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,733
- hey, you have the time?
- aw, not you again.

411
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,801
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.

412
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,837
Empty your pockets.
Hey, meth-head.

413
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,939
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.

414
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,508
Do it,
or I will kill you both.

415
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,677
Okay, here you go.
Look. Empty.

416
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,178
Now you.
I don't have anything.

417
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,880
Do it.
I don't have--

418
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,649
Just empty your pockets.
No. I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna--

419
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,852
I don't feel like standing
in this alley all night.

420
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,954
It's a matter of principle.
A matter of principle?

421
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:25,791
- I don't feel like standing
in an alley with a meth-head.
- I'm gonna stab you, man!

422
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,927
For the love of god,
empty your pockets.
Okay.

423
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,901
- what the hell is that?
- give it to me.

424
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,871
You give us a second.

425
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,775
Where did you
get that money?

426
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,711
I had to change the bet--
a little.

427
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,080
You bet against me?
I bet against you.

428
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,416
Why would you
bet against me?
It was the right move.

429
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:54,053
I mean, you got
your ass kicked.
Why wouldn't you tell me?

430
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,089
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had
to get my ass kicked.

431
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:00,059
Mac, it had to look real.

432
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,361
Were you gonna
tell me eventually?

433
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,999
Yes.
Yeah?

434
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,436
I was going
to tell you eventually.
Yeah?

435
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,272
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.

436
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,274
Oh, wait a second.
Oh, come on, mac.

437
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,376
Don't be like that, man.
You would have done
the same thing.

438
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:21,313
Come on, don't act
like a baby.

439
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,449
Please don't stab me.

440
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,618
Bash this ugly jerk's
face in, daddy.

441
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:29,788
Your last chance
to chicken out.
That ain't gonna happen, bobby.

442
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:33,192
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.
All right, frankie.

443
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,461
Seeing that we're
a couple of old men here,

444
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,563
I think we should
lay down some ground rules.

445
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,299
Now. Number one.

446
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,168
[ groans ]

447
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,315
[ loud crunch ]

448
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,893
Holy shit!

449
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,033
[ voices speaking backwards ]
