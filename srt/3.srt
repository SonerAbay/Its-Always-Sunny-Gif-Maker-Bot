1
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,280
I like what I'm seeing here!

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,782
- I like what you're doing right now!
- I like what you're doing!

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,944
- I like what you're doing!
- I like what we're all doing!

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,648
- I like this guy!
- This is insane!

5
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,350
- I know!
- This is good! This is a good scene!

6
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,326
- I've never seen so many beautiful people in my life!
- Hey, check it out!

7
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,920
Even Sweet Dee's getting lucky!

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,194
That dude's gonna bang your sister, bro.

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,100
- This is good, man. I feel good.
- You look good, brother.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,502
No, no, no, no.
I feel better than good.

11
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,770
- You know, I feel like, um... I feel like dancing.
- Whoa, it feels good, man!

12
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,834
- You should.
- I feel like dancing!

13
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,710
- Get out there, buddy. Make it happen. Nice.
- I feel like dancing!

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,385
<i>I love that little man.</i>

15
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,444
This is great.
I mean, what's going on?

16
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,286
- This is, like, the greatest night Paddy's has ever seen.
- I know!

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,018
<i>- Kind of a young crowd, right?
- Yeah!</i>

18
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,223
- Really, really young.
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,460
<i>What, do you think these kids
are in college or what?</i>

20
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,563
I don't know.
Hey. You. How old are you?

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,699
Twenty-one?

22
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,379
Everybody, out!

23
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,602
But I don't understand
how you guys could let this happen.

24
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,702
It was not my fault.
I was working behind the bar.

25
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,270
Come on, Dennis. You remember
what it was like in high school.

26
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,441
The minute we caught word
that a bar wasn't carding...

27
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,815
we would just pack the place
the following weekend.

28
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,377
They probably had a recon crew
come in last week.

29
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,015
- They definitely had...
- Why, you guys? Why were we not carding?

30
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,820
- Not my job.
- Not my job either.

31
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,090
It's all of our jobs. We could get
into a lot of trouble for this.

32
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,327
And we also have a social responsibility
to keep teenagers from drinking.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,391
I guess.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,830
- I don't know about that though.
- Oh, Mac!

35
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,740
- Mac, don't.
- Hold on a second. Hear me out.

36
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,372
It wasn't that long ago that we were in
the same position as these youngsters, right?

37
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,611
<i>I mean, we'd get kicked out of some bar,
and what did we do, Den?</i>

38
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,209
We would get a bunch of 40s
from a homeless guy...

39
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,221
and we'd go sit in some park, right?

40
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,519
- That is true. That is absolutely true.
- And what would happen?

41
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,891
We would almost get raped and/or murdered
and/or stabbed by crackheads in Fairmount Park.

42
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,123
You wanna know what else
what would happen?

43
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,690
We drove Nicky Potnik's car
into a tree on Kelly Drive.

44
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:53,467
With Sweet Dee in the backseat puking because
some guy talked to her that she liked, remember?

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,701
Every time some guy
talks to you that you like...

46
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,005
you get so nervous
you drink yourself into oblivion.

47
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,045
- I had bad potato salad.
- You drink yourself crazy.

48
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,104
You abused alcohol, and that's okay.

49
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,844
But it's very dangerous, right?
Right? Okay.

50
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,979
Well, maybe we should look at this
whole thing from a different angle.

51
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:13,856
Maybe we have "a social responsibility"
to provide a safe haven...

52
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,623
for these kids to be kids.

53
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,221
- You know, experiment.
- No. I don't like where this is heading.

54
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,790
- We would have to set up ground rules.
- Okay.

55
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,302
No drinking and driving.
No one's gonna crash Nicky Potnik's car.

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,338
- Right.
- Everyone has to take a cab.

57
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,807
Four drink maximum. Like, that's it.
You know what I mean?

58
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,334
Yeah, yeah. That's it.
Anyone causing trouble can't come.

59
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,143
- If you're gonna be here, you gotta be cool.
- He's gone! He's gone!

60
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,707
Listen, we water down the drinks,
jack up the prices.

61
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,583
- Oh, my... Come on!
- We could make a serious profit off these kids.

62
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,918
And they'd have no idea
what the hell's going on.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,323
- We would actually be doing something good.
- Great. I say we do it.

64
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,726
- Yeah.
- I don't know how you guys live with yourselves.

65
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,198
- One day at a time.
- One day at a time.

66
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,065
<i>Yeah, I know, Mom.
I heard you the first time.</i>

67
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,537
I'm perfectly aware of what time it is.
Thank you, Mom.

68
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,075
Do we have to do this right now?

69
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:07,101
Yeah, I know how old I am. Did you think
that I forgot, maybe, how old... That's...

70
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,775
As a matter of fact, I have a date
this afternoon with my friend Steven.

71
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,910
So I should probably go,
'cause I gotta get ready for that.

72
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,479
Mm-hmm.
All right. Yeah, you too. Bye.

73
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,163
Hello, Steven.

74
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,429
Hello.

75
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,403
- Dee?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,906
- This is Trey from last night.
- Oh, hey, Trey.

77
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,408
You know what? I don't think
I should be talking with you.

78
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:42,346
I think you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever met in my entire life.

79
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,349
Really?

80
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,477
I can't believe that someone as gorgeous
as you can be so down to earth.

81
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:51,011
Well, you know, I've always tried to
keep both feet on the ground, so...

82
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,115
Yeah. So, listen,
I have a lacrosse game...

83
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,628
but I was wondering if you wanted to meet me
and my friends at Lemon Hill afterwards.

84
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,563
Lemon Hill?
That's where all the cool kids used to go.

85
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,965
- Good. So you've been there.
- Oh! Come on.

86
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,163
I've been there, like, 200 times.

87
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,231
Why don't you stop by? I mean, unless
you got something better to do today.

88
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,012
Wow. You can really put 'em back,
can't you?

89
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,146
The trick is to
just kind of open your throat.

90
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,248
You are so much cooler
than all the other girls I know.

91
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,092
You are so sweet.
Can you get me another one of these?

92
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,461
<i>Whoo!</i>

93
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,194
<i>- All right. There you go.
- Look how much fun they're having, man.</i>

94
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,759
Of course they are. They haven't
realized how much life sucks yet.

95
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,136
Remember how great high school was?
All those parties, no responsibilities.

96
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,199
- High school was the best.
- Do you guys even remember high school?

97
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,973
- I don't think it happened the way you think.
- What do you mean?

98
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,607
The only reason you got to hang out
with me and the other cool kids...

99
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,617
is 'cause you sold us all weed.

100
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,415
- Everybody thought you were an asshole.
- I was popular!

101
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,787
Mac was very popular. And I like to think
I was pretty popular myself.

102
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,692
<i>- You were.
- No, he was. You were popular like a clown is popular.</i>

103
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,753
- What?
- Yeah, you made us all laugh.

104
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,958
All the guys knew you couldn't sleep
with their girlfriends.

105
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,695
Whatever, dude. The only reason
you got laid is 'cause you dated freshmen.

106
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,964
Yeah. You've always had
that creepy thing with younger girls.

107
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,734
- I do not.
- You're not in high school anymore, pal.

108
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,401
You better keep it in the pants,
'cause it's kind of creepy.

109
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,411
You want to talk about creepy?

110
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,414
You guys sniffing glue in your mom's
basement. That's creepy.

111
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,476
Tim Murphy slept with your prom date.

112
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,317
<i>Tim Murphy slept with your prom date!</i>

113
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,381
- Tim Murphy had sex with your prom date!
- That's right.

114
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,556
<i>- Oh. He's getting sad now.
- Oh, no.</i>

115
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,723
- There's, like, watering in the eyes.
- Now he's running away.

116
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,393
<i>Oh, is he gonna cry?</i>

117
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:47,167
Did you see that? He was totally gonna cry.

118
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,302
Oh, Trey, that is so sad.

119
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,506
It was a really bad breakup.

120
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,073
I mean, Tammy's great and all.
I just wasn't feeling it, you know?

121
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,485
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta feel it.

122
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,615
Don't get me wrong.
Tammy's, like, the prettiest girl in school...

123
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,682
so it was a perfect match.

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,456
- It just wasn't working.
- Hmm.

125
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,464
She's not as pretty as you though.

126
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,332
Oh! Thank you.

127
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,837
Wait! I can't do this.

128
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,869
- What?
- I never statutory raped anyone before.

129
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,939
Oh. Okay. I'll tell you what.

130
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,282
Let's, uh, just take it slow.

131
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,913
You are so sweet.

132
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,651
Where were you
when I was in high school?

133
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,659
I was eight.

134
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,454
Right.

135
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,897
Yeah.

136
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,732
These kids are wasted, bro.
I thought we were cuttin' 'em off.

137
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,638
I am cuttin' 'em off. These kids haven't
had more than three drinks each.

138
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,939
Plus, there's so much water, they're probably
more hydrated than they ever have been.

139
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,571
- Are they fakin' it?
- I guess.

140
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,242
<i>- Just stay away from me, Billy!
- No, Sara! I saw you flirting with him!</i>

141
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,650
<i>No, I know it.
You were throwing yourself on him!</i>

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,553
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

143
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,456
Give me some eyes!
Look at me! Cool your jets!

144
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,324
- I'm sorry.
- All right, beat it!

145
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,590
- Are you okay?
- He's such a player.

146
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,155
- Is he a player?
- Big time.

147
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,863
I hate players. All right. I'm sorry.
I'm getting fired up here.

148
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,428
Charlie, that was the coolest thing
you've ever done!

149
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,475
I know. I'm gonna be sick.

150
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,774
- Oh, shit.
- You Dennis Reynolds?

151
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,754
- Yeah.
- You like what you see?

152
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,018
Uh, I don't know.

153
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,323
Dude, relax. I'm 18.

154
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,454
- Are you in high school?
- Yes.

155
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,091
- Then take a hike.
- Doesn't seem to bother your sister.

156
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,066
What?

157
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,832
She was all over this one boy
in my class today.

158
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,840
Really?

159
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,069
Listen, dude, I'm legal...

160
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,475
and I love to party.

161
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,106
So if you're looking for
the ride of your life...

162
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,945
give me a call.

163
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,125
Goddamn it.

164
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,091
<i>Hang on. I'm coming!</i>

165
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,391
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What?

166
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,261
I know you were hanging out with
that high school kid from the bar.

167
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,858
Okay. You know what?
We're just friends, all right?

168
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:34,031
He went through a really bad breakup,
and he just needed me to be there for him.

169
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,131
What you're doing is sick and wrong.

170
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,199
Are you living out
some sad fantasy of yours?

171
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,542
- Going out with the most popular kid in high school.
- Why would that be a fantasy?

172
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,605
I went out with tons of guys
in high school.

173
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,150
You wore that scoliosis back brace
until you were 20 years old.

174
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,209
- Everyone was afraid of you.
- No, they weren't.

175
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,848
- You looked like a monster! Do you all have amnesia?
- What is that supposed to mean?

176
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,654
Oh, my God. You're as delusional
as Mac and Charlie.

177
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,560
Do not compare me to Mac and Charlie.

178
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,394
I'm telling you,
this is the wrong kind of glue, Charlie.

179
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,458
- No, it's not.
- This is made for, like, kindergartners or something.

180
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,699
- No, this will work.
- No, look. "Nontoxic and safe."

181
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,104
We don't want safe. We want toxic.

182
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,735
- Something's happening.
- Nothing is gonna happen.

183
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,278
- Something's happening.
- Nothing's gonna happen.

184
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,337
No, you're right. This isn't working.

185
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,977
Y'ello. Yeah.

186
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,546
Oh, hey. How are you?

187
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,825
Really? That's cool.

188
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,888
Yeah. Okay.

189
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,900
Bye.

190
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,960
Dude. That was that girl Sara,
the one from the bar the other night...

191
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,029
who I rescued from that kid.

192
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:45,065
Well, her parents are out of town,
and she's totally having a party.

193
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,738
What do you think?

194
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,219
Kind of a lame party, bro.

195
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,519
Uh, what do you think?
Should we jet?

196
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,583
Yeah. This doesn't feel right.

197
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,891
<i>Hey, guys!</i>

198
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,023
- Hi, Sara.
- Hey.

199
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,260
I'm so glad you guys came.

200
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,168
Well, uh, we ran into
a little bit of a problem.

201
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,231
My brother, he was supposed to
pick up the keg, but he bailed on me.

202
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,869
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah. Yeah, it totally sucks.

203
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,574
So, um, we were wondering
if maybe you guys could help us out.

204
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,750
- Oh, you mean... No, I don't...
- Ooh, no.

205
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,050
Geez, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

206
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,353
Listen, it's one thing at the bar, you know,
where we have control over you guys.

207
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:36,417
- It's another thing...
- Ah, come on, please? Please.

208
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,329
- You guys have been so cool.
- Yeah, we were just talking about how cool you guys were.

209
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,061
- Really?
- You were?

210
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,127
Mm-hmm. This would be the coolest thing
that anyone's ever done for us.

211
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,139
- Ever.
- Ever.

212
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,470
Who wants to do a keg stand?

213
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,821
<i>Um, I'm kind ofhaving
second thoughts a little bit.</i>

214
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,521
Oh, come on. It'll be a blast.

215
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,657
Yeah, well, I don't think
your friends like me that much.

216
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,430
<i>Let's go get a beer.</i>

217
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,404
Twenty-five, 26...

218
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:23,703
27, 28, 29!

219
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,880
- Hey, Dee.
- Hi, guys.

220
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,457
- What's going on?
- Just hanging out, you know?

221
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,494
Yeah.

222
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,359
Wanna do a keg stand?

223
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,424
Seventy-five, 76, 77!

224
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,540
- Seventy-seven seconds! That is a
new record, baby! - I did it. I did it.

225
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,372
So, Ben is, like,
"I don't care what Kevin said, Sara.

226
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,936
I was only going out with Rachel
to get closer to you."

227
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,745
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
What did you say to that?

228
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,549
"Whatever, Ben. I heard from Caitlin
that you were totally into her."

229
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,751
Um, he's so full of shit.

230
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,494
<i>Goddamn!</i>

231
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,124
Come on. Oh, come on.

232
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,438
Yeah! What do you think
about that, bitches?

233
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,406
<i>Load 'em up, losers!
What do you think about this, huh?</i>

234
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,501
How I embarrassed your boyfriend
in front of everybody? You like that?

235
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,944
- You like what you see?
- What's with this guy?

236
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:38,107
I know. What is he, like, 40?

237
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:41,152
Get me some more! Get me some more!
Let's go! Load 'em up!

238
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,986
- I'm gonna put on a goddamn clinic!
- What an asshole.

239
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:01,205
Come on, guys. Hey.
Let's go. Let's go!

240
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,140
- Oh, get off me, dude!
- Get off me!

241
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,677
Can we please get out of here?
Let's go.

242
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,372
Why?

243
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,076
Trey asked me to prom last night.
This is getting really weird.

244
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,619
- That girl Sara asked me too.
- You're kidding!

245
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:17,814
What? No, we can't go to the prom.
That's pathetic.

246
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,051
What do you mean "we"?
Who asked you?

247
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,052
Let's just go. Let's just go.

248
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:27,861
All right, all right. I'm coming.

249
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,369
- Hi, sexy.
- What are you doing here? You gotta get out of here.

250
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,636
I need a date for the prom,
and I want you to take me.

251
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,905
Are you kidding me?
I can't do that, okay?

252
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:44,039
- You gotta go.
- Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind?

253
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,078
No. No, no, no. No.
Leave. Leave. Go.

254
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,714
Okay. You can either
take me to the prom...

255
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,623
or I can tell the police
that you're serving underage kids.

256
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,059
- Are you serious?
- Try me.

257
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,459
Goddamn it.

258
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,027
You know what? I don't think we
should be serving minors anymore.

259
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:10,666
- Oh, no. Somebody's jealous.
- I'm not jealous. I just think it's dangerous.

260
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,870
<i>- You're jealous you didn't get asked to the prom.
- I don't care about that.</i>

261
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,006
- Ah, you're gonna cry?
- Shut up!

262
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,314
Yo, you guys?
No more kids in the bar, seriously.

263
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:24,480
- Okay! Now we're talking some sense.
- What the hell?

264
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,320
- This girl asked me to the prom.
- What?

265
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,917
Yeah. This girl
comes over to my house...

266
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,125
tells me that if I don't go to the prom with her,
she's gonna rat us out to the cops.

267
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,293
Wait a second. Hold on.
So all of you guys got asked to the prom?

268
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,338
You guys got asked to the prom?

269
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,270
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

270
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,502
Oh, this is so lame!

271
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,204
At least you don't actually have to go.

272
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,214
- Are you going?
- Yeah. I have to.

273
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,342
Oh, well, if you're going,
I'm going then, I guess.

274
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,352
- So you...
- What?

275
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,719
I didn't get to go when I was in high school.
It might actually be fun.

276
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,122
<i>If you guys are going, I'm going.
I'm not staying here.</i>

277
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,127
- Are you gonna go?
- I'm gonna go.

278
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,060
- I have to go, so...
- You guys are pathetic!

279
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,496
Maybe if you weren't such a jerk,
someone might have asked you.

280
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,161
Because Sara told me that Maureen told her
that Regina McGinley thought you were cute.

281
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,262
- Then Ray Rafferty comes up to you at the party, and you're...
- Charlie, shut up!

282
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,435
The only reason that Sara asked you in the
first place is because you're the only idiot...

283
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,968
dumb enough to listen to her bitch
about her ex-boyfriend all night!

284
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,208
Whatever.

285
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,584
Hey, we should have a pre-prom party.

286
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,513
You know what, Charlie?

287
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,821
I think this is actually
gonna be pretty great.

288
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,225
Oh, dude, are you kidding me?
This is gonna be awesome.

289
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,322
- I can't wait to just get out there and start dancing.
- I'm gonna dance too.

290
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,425
- Are you gonna dance, baby? You gonna dance with me?
- I'm gonna dance like this.

291
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,438
Oh, Dee! Come here.
Let me take a look at you.

292
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,600
Wow. You look... You look... Yeah.

293
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:55,340
I know. I feel so lucky
that this thing even fits still.

294
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,475
- Is that your dress from high school?
- Yup.

295
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,009
- You didn't go to the prom in high school, Dee.
- No, I know.

296
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,751
My back brace was under the dress,
and Mom called me fat.

297
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,918
So I stayed home and cried instead.

298
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,394
Take... Take it slow. Take it slow.

299
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,455
<i>I know, you guys,
but I just am so nervous.</i>

300
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,024
I just want this whole night
to be so special.

301
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,571
That dude is going to
bang your sister, bro.

302
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,632
- What's up, bitches? Mmm!
- What is this? What are you doing?

303
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,907
You assholes aren't gonna be the only ones
having fun. I'm going to the prom.

304
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,576
- Dork! You cannot crash a high school prom.
- I'm going stag, bro.

305
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,778
Mac, you are so pathetic.

306
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,617
Yes, and your eyebrows
are drawn on, so...

307
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,055
Whoa. Well, you know what?

308
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,252
How 'bout this?

309
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,352
Say it, don't spray it.

310
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,057
<i>Trey's here. Oh, my God.</i>

311
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:51,796
Hello. Excuse me, Mac.
My date has arrived.

312
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,101
Trey is so cool.

313
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,698
He's totally gonna bang your sister.

314
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,606
Hello, sweet prince.

315
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,411
Wow! You look... good.

316
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,952
I know! Like a princess.

317
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,319
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Sure.

318
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,324
Beat it.

319
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:19,759
- I always wanted to have sex on prom.
- Ah.

320
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,493
All right. So what's the plan?
Do we have a limo or what?

321
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,297
- The plan is, you're not coming with us.
- Yeah.

322
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,838
- Why not?
- You weren't invited and you don't have a date.

323
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,897
- You totally suck.
- I totally suck?

324
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,966
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Oh, Jesus.

325
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,677
Oh, who is that?

326
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,308
- That's my prom date.
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,909
She's unbelievable.
How old is she?

328
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,887
- She's 18.
- Eighteen?

329
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,446
- You are a lucky man. You are a lucky man.
- Oh, you dick!

330
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,756
Wait a second. You guys called me creepy
for liking young chicks.

331
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,388
Eighteen's legal, bro.
This isn't a morality contest.

332
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,523
Eighteen's not young, brother.

333
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,000
- So you guys are giving me the
go-ahead? I mean, can I... - Go ahead.

334
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,334
- Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.

335
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,897
- You look...
- Yeah, I know.

336
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,944
- Do ya?
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:11,449
- I can't zip it up. Your hair's all caught.
- All right. Just pull it.

338
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,814
Oh.

339
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,088
- Tammy?
- Mm-mmm. No. What?

340
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,057
Hold on one minute.

341
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,651
- Can I get you a drink?
- Maybe.

342
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,061
- What would you like?
- Anything you want.

343
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,931
- Tammy, what are you doing here?
- I'm picking up my date.

344
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,162
You're going to prom with this guy?

345
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,899
Yes.

346
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,271
Can I talk to you for a second?

347
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,606
What the hell is going on?

348
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,203
That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend.

349
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,510
This is classic Tammy.

350
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,915
Trey broke up with Tammy
because Maureen Kinallen said...

351
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,419
that she saw Tammy flirting
with Walt Timby at a party.

352
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,184
But she was only doing it
to make Trey jealous because, you know...

353
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,248
she thought that Trey
secretly liked Erin Hannabry.

354
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,954
But Trey didn't like Erin Hannabry.
It was all a bunch of bull.

355
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,861
- What is happening?
- That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend.

356
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,866
This is classic Tammy.
Trey broke up with Tammy...

357
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,528
Charlie, you gotta stop, honestly.

358
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,573
<i>- What are they talking about?
- Whoa!</i>

359
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,033
<i>- Where are they going?
- What the hell is this?</i>

360
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,774
Oh, man! Ah, they did it.
They got what they wanted.

361
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,840
- This is bullshit.
- So wait a second.

362
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,909
They were actually using you two...

363
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,012
to make each other jealous.

364
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,547
I always knew that they'd wind up together,
'cause they're, like, so perfect for each other.

365
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,117
- Shut up, Charlie!
- They're one of those perfect matches.

366
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,028
- That dude's gonna bang your prom date, bro.
- Stop saying it!

367
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,931
- It's not funny!
- Hey, why are you such an asshole all the time?

368
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,232
I'm not the asshole. You guys are the ones
that just got dumped on prom night.

369
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,738
- You got dumped on prom night!
- You were gonna go stag.

370
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,207
- Yes, I was. Absolutely.
- How old are you, dude?

371
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,506
- I am 28 years old.
- You're a piece of crap!

372
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,570
- I'm not a piece of crap! You're a piece of crap.
- I have to pee.

373
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,775
Stop it. Go pee.

374
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,886
I hate you, Charlie.

375
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,513
Just like high school.
