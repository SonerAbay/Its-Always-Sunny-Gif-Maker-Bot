1
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,496
DENNIS: Well, okay,
what would you do, Dee?

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:04,871
SWEET DEE: I'm saying that if I
were a cop, I would have an Uzi.

3
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:07,020
Well, but I'm saying that the
police force would never issue

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:07,689
you an Uzi, so now what?

5
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,091
CHARLIE: That's not
her point, though.

6
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,290
That's not what we're talking about, that's not my...
Thank you, Charlie.

7
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:13,718
Listen, if you had the choice,
would you choose to carry one

8
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:16,667
gun that shoots one bullet or
would you choose to carry an

9
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,418
Uzi-- one gun that shoots a
thousand bullets in one second?

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,521
Yeah, you're shooting
bullets everywhere.

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:20,267
FRANK: I agree with her 100%.

12
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,494
- Right?
- I mean, she's absolutely right.

13
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,627
Got people coming at
you from every angle.

14
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:28,233
Frank, honestly, if you're going to join
in the conversation, will you swallow

15
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,300
your food and then speak?

16
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:30,302
It's disgusting.

17
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,304
MAC: Yeah, hey, Frank, what
are you eating over there?

18
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:33,204
A hoagie.

19
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,238
You are not eating a hoagie.

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,405
You are just jamming meats and
cheeses inside of your mouth.

21
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,773
I like to make it in my mouth.

22
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,607
It tastes better.

23
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,977
Frankie?

24
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,319
Gino?

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,225
You piece of shit!

26
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:56,459
GINO: You son of a bitch!

27
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,460
(both grunting)

28
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,228
I'll kill you, I'll kill
you, I'll kill you!

29
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,896
Now, this is interesting.

30
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:00,897
Yeah.

31
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,266
Yeah.

32
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:03,501
Now, do we break this up?

33
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:04,969
No, no, n-no, d-don't
break it up.

34
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:07,338
I want to see how this
whole thing plays out.

35
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,541
(grunting continues)

36
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:11,543
Oh!

37
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,978
Okay, well, that
seemed to settle it.

38
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,979
Yep.

39
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,115
Okay, all right,
okay, all right.

40
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:20,486
Jesus Christ, Frank, who
the hell is this man?

41
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:22,421
My goddamn brother.

42
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,223
(Frank growls)

43
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:36,241

44
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,803
Frank, I had no idea
you had a brother.

45
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:51,849
Yeah, what gives, Frank?

46
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,062
You told us your
brother was dead.

47
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:55,340
Yeah, you said that he had
his guts sucked out of his

48
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,408
asshole through a hot tub drain.

49
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,677
You told that to my
own niece and nephew?

50
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,729
Uh, well, technically, sir, he's
not our father, which would

51
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:02,627
mean you're not our uncle.

52
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,817
Yeah, we thought he was for a
long time, and then as it turns

53
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,718
out... You know what?

54
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,420
It's a whole thing, so...
Yeah, let's not get into it.

55
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:07,902
How could you do
this to me, Frankie?

56
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:09,068
Do what, Gino?

57
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:10,876
You know what I'm talking about.

58
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,934
You're trying to
steal her from me.

59
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:14,302
She's my woman.

60
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,618
You stole her from me first.

61
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,206
Well, you stole her back.

62
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,475
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who the hell
are you guys talking about?

63
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:21,710
BOTH: The love of my life.

64
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:23,478
Well, this just got
more interesting.

65
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,379
I'm gonna pull up a
seat and get into it.

66
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,981
This just got very
interesting, Frank.

67
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,917
Why don't you walk
us through this?

68
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,619
No, I'm not dragging
this shit up again.

69
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,887
This is ancient history.

70
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,957
No, no, no, I think
they need to hear this.

71
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,794
I think they need to hear what a
liar and a cheat their father is.

72
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:40,929
Let me start at the beginning.

73
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,431
It was back in the '60s.

74
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,633
I'm gonna jump in for a
second 'cause it sounds like

75
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:46,234
you're about to launch
into a whole thing.

76
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,104
Is it going to
take a long time?

77
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,538
My attention span
is very short.

78
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
That's a valid concern.

79
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,976
It'll take as long as it takes.

80
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,377
Ah... okay.

81
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,279
Well, we might pop
in and out mentally.

82
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,682
Yeah, you know, our generation-- it's like...
Yeah, you want to make it

83
00:02:58,684 --> 00:02:59,283
funny or something?

84
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:00,117
Give it some flair.

85
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:04,422
Okay, it was in the '60s.

86
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:05,423
(jazz playing)

87
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:08,726
If you were looking for me,
you'd find me at a happening

88
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:11,929
little jazz club on the
north side of town.

89
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:14,065
It was an all-black joint.

90
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,200
Blacks played the best music.

91
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,736
Not that I gave a
shit-- I got a tin ear.

92
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,505
It all sounded like a
bunch of noise to me.

93
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:24,375
See, I was running numbers
as a bookie for the club.

94
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,610
I'd take bets for
the owner Reggie.

95
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:27,511
REGGIE: Yo, Gino.

96
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,746
He had a temper.

97
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:33,183
He also had a weakness for betting horses
and a strength for losing those bets.

98
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:39,221
You see, Reggie owed me money, and when
he came up short, I called in a favor.

99
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:40,989
I need you to hire someone.

100
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,625
I ain't hiring another one
of your bimbos, Gino.

101
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:46,093
This bimbo is my little brother.

102
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,094
He's here every night
for the music.

103
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,830
He's more Negro-ish than
anybody else in this club.

104
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,166
Frankie.

105
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,033
Gino.

106
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,034
(Frank humming)

107
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,969
How would you like to work here?

108
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,171
Would I ever?

109
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:59,972
I love the music, sir.

110
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:00,973
He's just a kid.

111
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,107
How old are you, boy?

112
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,509
Nineteen.

113
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,812
Shit, you don't
look a day over 12.

114
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,880
I'll do anything.

115
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,182
I was looking out for
my younger brother.

116
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,117
I was keeping him
out of trouble.

117
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,386
I got Frankie a job
and he loved it.

118
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,921
That was a shit job.

119
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,757
I was mopping up puke, I was
busing tables and washing dishes.

120
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,159
It stunk.

121
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,394
♪ <i>So far, so good...</i> ♪

122
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,596
But at least I had that sweet
music to keep me going.

123
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,697
♪ <i>So far, so good...</i> ♪

124
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,034
And then one night I heard
the voice of an angel.

125
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,035
No, not her.

126
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,302
♪ So far, so good ♪

127
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,537
♪ <i>So far, so good</i> ♪

128
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:38,538
Keep going.

129
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,573
♪ I thought by now You
would be long gone... ♪

130
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,474
That's her.

131
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,909
♪ <i>So far, so good...</i> ♪

132
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:47,746
Boy, she was the cat's meow.

133
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:50,014
That was Shadynasty.

134
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,015
Got to stop you.

135
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:51,682
Good time to stop.

136
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:58,353
Okay, so... The love of your life
was a black woman named Shadynasty?

137
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,354
Yeah.

138
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,356
So what's wrong with that?

139
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,257
Well, th-th-there's
nothing wrong with it.

140
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:03,924
Lots of things.

141
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:04,758
It's strange, it's strange.

142
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,759
It's just unexpected.

143
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,626
Yeah, that's strange.

144
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:07,627
Shadynasty.

145
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:08,294
Well, go on, though.

146
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:08,961
All right.

147
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:13,932
All right, so it was late one night, I
was cleaning up, doing my usual routine.

148
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:14,933
(glass shattering)

149
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,869
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

150
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,637
SHADYNASTY: I saw you with her.

151
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,273
Bitch, if I want to be with another
woman, I'll be with another woman.

152
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,007
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

153
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:22,674
(overlapping shouting)

154
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,676
Relax, relax, be cool,
daddy-o, be cool.

155
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,277
Gino, get this bitch
out of my sight.

156
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,879
You just be cool, man,
don't blow your top.

157
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,148
Breaking my dishes,
bitch, goddamn.

158
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,985
Hey, Frankie here is gonna take you
home and I'm gonna talk to Reggie.

159
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:36,320
He old enough to drive?

160
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,322
Sure.

161
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:51,620
For a while, we drove in silence until I
finally got the nerve to speak to her.

162
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,025
You got a huge set on you.

163
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,809
Excuse me?

164
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:58,876
Pipes-- you got a great voice.

165
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:03,376
Oh, thank you.

166
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:05,245
You like black music?

167
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,245
Do I?

168
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,781
I'm gonna open a jazz joint of
my own someday-- an integrated

169
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:13,752
place where blacks and
whites can get along.

170
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:16,822
No Orientals, though.

171
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:19,726
You got to have a
dream, I guess.

172
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,929
And you're going to be
my star attraction.

173
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:26,300
Child, I ain't nothing
but a backup singer.

174
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,503
Oh, no, you're the real,
true star, Shadynasty.

175
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:34,241
You just need a
sky to shine in.

176
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:38,813
If I didn't know better, I'd
think you were flirting with me.

177
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,881
White man. Get down.

178
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,384
Whoa, why were you
shoving her head down?

179
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:47,387
You did not want to be caught out in the
street in those days with a Negress.

180
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,188
They'd tear you apart.

181
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,189
Negress?

182
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,190
What?

183
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,058
Whatever the proper word was.

184
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,726
Well, it's not that,
it's a different word.

185
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,194
It wasn't that.

186
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,263
We're talking '60s terms.

187
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,097
Okay.

188
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:57,698
Okay.

189
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,699
Okay, you used those terms.

190
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,533
You shouldn't have.

191
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,302
Did you open the club or what?

192
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:03,170
You bet your ass I did.

193
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,005
With hard work
and perseverance.

194
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,442
Bullshit. We opened the club
with my gambling money.

195
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,610
And that's when we became
business partners.

196
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:15,784
The point is, we opened the club, and
we named it after our star attraction.

197
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:22,091
Shady-nasty's?

198
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,961
Shadynasty's, asshole.

199
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:27,030
Whatever.

200
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,332
He's out of here.

201
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,701
Is that how you spell it?

202
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:34,503
So business was booming.

203
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:38,407
♪ Like fire needs the
air to breathe... ♪

204
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,075
Shadynasty was a star.

205
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:44,546
♪ Desire's coming over me I
wanna please you, babe... ♪

206
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:48,651
And every night, it seemed
like she was singing to me.

207
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:51,487
♪ Oh...
sometimes it gets me... ♪

208
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,489
'Cause she was.

209
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,897
Frankie's dreams
were coming true.

210
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:07,503
Mmm... But sometimes
dreams come at a price.

211
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:10,272
Well, well, well.

212
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,075
Ain't this some shit.

213
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,443
Hi, Reggie.

214
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,078
How you doing?

215
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,681
Not good, Frankie.

216
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:21,317
No?

217
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,852
I gave you everything.

218
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:25,154
Then you go and
take my best bitch.

219
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,322
I'm not anyone's bitch.

220
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,358
I left you, Reggie.

221
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,093
I'm with Frank now.

222
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,295
Oh, you with her now, huh?

223
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,263
Yeah.

224
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,866
I guess that don't leave
me with no choice...

225
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:44,471
...but to be a mature-ass
adult about this shit.

226
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,473
I'm working on my temper.

227
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:51,745
But know..
that I strongly disagree with this!

228
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,084
She's your problem now.

229
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:59,986
Good luck, Frankie.

230
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:01,954
Gino, what are you doing?

231
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,989
Saving your life.

232
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,024
Run, Frankie.

233
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,125
(siren wailing)

234
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:09,162
No, don't...
The police carted off me and Reggie.

235
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:12,065
I got two years in the
slammer and Reggie got six.

236
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,134
Wait. Why did Reggie get
more years than you?

237
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,502
You beat the man half to death.

238
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,904
He was black.

239
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,806
Those were the days.

240
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,676
You sound like you yearn
for those days, Frank.

241
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:22,978
No.

242
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,215
I'm just saying those
were the days.

243
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,016
Huh.

244
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:27,716
Mm-hmm.

245
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:28,483
Okay.

246
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:35,123
Anyway, by the time I got out of
prison, the '70s had arrived.

00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,435
I really missed you.

Oh, I missed...
What the shit is that?

254
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,007
A little bump of coke.

255
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,409
Since when do you do drugs?

256
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,010
Prison. It's the '70s, Frank.

257
00:09:58,012 --> 00:09:59,645
Everybody does drugs.

Gino, Gino, Gino, Gino, not, not...
not in my club.

No, no, no.

Relax.

263
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:08,454
I got a gun for protection.

264
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:09,155
Wait!

265
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:11,323
What are you doing
with that gun?!

Help yourself.

271
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,565
Make a sandwich in your mouth.

272
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:20,599
It tastes really good.

00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,600
I know how to do it.

274

I'm the one who
taught you to do it!

Oh, God.

276
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:24,937
This is insufferable.

277
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,939
Oh, my... Please, just continue.

278
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:29,741
I just wanted to make an
honest woman of Shadynasty.

279
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:33,079
Settle down, start
a life together.

280
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:38,685
I was building up the
nerve to ask her.

281
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:40,187
I want those peas.

282
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:40,954
Let me see that.

283
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:45,527
Okay, all right... While I was busting
my ass running the club, saving money

284
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,931
wherever I could, Gino was
just having one big party.

286
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:01,141

No-no, no-no-no-no.

289
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:08,247
I'm going to tell
you how it went.

290
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,852
First off, I was banging babes
left and right, left and right.

291
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:16,255

293
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:22,128
But my past came
back to bite me.

294
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,096
Get lost, bimbo.

295
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,298
Gino.

296
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,734
Reggie, you're out of prison.

297
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,903
It ain't Reggie no more.

298
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,106
It's Hakim Mohamed.

299
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:34,707
What's with the getup?

300
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,676
Prison changed me.

301
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:38,678
I'm a Black Panther now.

302
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,581
We strong black men; we don't
take kindly to you slingin' dope

303
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,183
in our hood, you dig?

304
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,018
Are you threatening me?

305
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,220
You bet your ass I am.

306
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:50,923
But maybe this will
change your mind.

307
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,992
(gunshot)

308
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,960
Ah, shit.

309
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,228
It's a goddamn petition!

310
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,962
What the hell?!

311
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:58,396
I thought he was pulling a gun.

312
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,365
All right, I'm going to
take care of this, Frankie.

313
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,200
You got to disappear
for a while.

314
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,601
Disappear?
Where am I going to disappear to?

315
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,437
We're going to get you
to South America.

316
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:06,204
I got connections.

317
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:06,905
South America?

318
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:07,706
What about Shadynasty?

319
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,441
I'm gonna look after Shadynasty.

320
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:10,175
Frankie!

321
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,344
Shadynasty!

322
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:12,345
Frankie!

323
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,914
No! Shadynasty!

324
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,016
(sobbing)

325
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:25,759
That's when I started
my new life.

326
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,393
Colombia.

327
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:30,663
What a dump.

328
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,399
Gino scored me a job all right.

329
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:37,469
I was quality control for his
Colombian cocaine connection.

330
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,342
I'd become everything I hated.

331
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:50,015
The only thing that kept me going
was writing letters to Shadynasty.

332
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:53,052
I wrote her every night.

333
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,654
But I never heard back.

334
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,595
(echoing): Shadynasty!

335
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:08,201
I occupied my mind immersing
myself in the culture.

336
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,371
Taking in the cuisine.

337
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,172
But mostly doing cocaine.

338
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,408
(snorting)

339
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,410
(yelling)

340
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,881
Ah!

341
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,849
That part was a blast actually.

342
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,385
(yelling)

343
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:31,590
Weeks turned into months, and
months turned into years.

344
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,826
(yelling)

345
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,829
But I had to wean myself off.

346
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:44,939
I was living life just
going through the motions.

347
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,608
I knew I had to get back home.

348
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,809
(woman moaning)

349
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,077
Back to Shadynasty.

350
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,678
Yes!

351
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,880
You shouldn't be calling.

352
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,114
It's too risky.

353
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:57,518
The little birdie wants
to fly back to the cage.

354
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,121
It's too close to the stove.

355
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,956
There's too much heat.

356
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,292
The little birdie
can stand the heat.

357
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,128
He wants to migrate home.

358
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,265
The little birdie can't come home
on account of the attempted murder!

359
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,501
Why'd you say that, Gino?!

360
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,302
You used my name.

361
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:17,703
I'm going to hang up now.

362
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,038
And don't come home, Frankie.

363
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,773
Now you used my name!

364
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,442

365
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,443

She said that you were

Oh, to get you hooked on drugs?

What's it going to be?

395
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,744
Drugs.

396
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:05,612
Huh?

397
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,046
I choose drugs.

398
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:07,947
Drugs?

399
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:08,915
Drugs!

400
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,850
She said drugs.

401
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:15,221
You know, it's the way
things go in the world.

402
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:15,922
You understand.

403
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,590
You son of a bitch!

404
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,292
Frankie, no...
You son of a bitch!

405
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,395
Stop it! Stop it!

406
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,696

I was bald before you were bald.

409
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:30,036
You son of a bitch!

410
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,472
(all yelling)

411
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,207
Break it up.

412
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,710
You could have had
any girl you wanted.

413
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,412
She was my one and only.

414
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,680
You stole her from me.

415
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:41,150
You're stealing her from me.

416
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:45,021
I found the new love letters you've
been writing to her, Frankie.

417
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:47,590
Talking about meeting up
again and running away.

418
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,225
What are you talking about?

419
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,527
I haven't written
to her in years.

420
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:52,929
Bullshit!

421
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:56,599
They're all signed, "Love,
your one and only."

422
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,035
I should have destroyed these, like I
destroyed the letters from Colombia.

423
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,518
What?

424
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:07,677
You destroyed the letters
I wrote to Shadynasty?

425
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,347
I intercepted and I
read every one of them.

426
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,982
They were poetry.

427
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,854
Each one was more
beautiful than the last.

428
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:18,822
Too beautiful, though.

429
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:21,560
I couldn't let
Shadynasty read them.

430
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,863
Not if she was going
to stay with me.

431
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:28,968
But these letters--
these are smut.

432
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,702
"I want to be in you.

433
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,605
My dick is a raging
bull for you."

434
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:39,177
And this one, here, "Meet me at the
airport, Friday, at 5:00, Terminal C.

435
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,245
Love, your one and only."

436
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:43,315
You are trying to steal her from me,
Frankie, and I ain't gonna let you.

437
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:46,285
Gino, Gino.

438
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,754
That's not me.

439
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:51,056
I'm telling you, I
never wrote those.

440
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:51,690
What?

441
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:53,192
I'm putting something
together here.

442
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,328
She's at the airport right
now meeting some dude.

443
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,732
So, like, if you want to try and
get her back, you got to move.

444
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:00,034
Guys, it's almost 5:00.

445
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,336
Now I'd like to see this
whole story play out.

446
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:04,005
It's appealing to
the romantic in me.

447
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,072
I feel like I want to see it.

448
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,040
Come on, man.

449
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:06,841
Let's go to the airport.

450
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:07,742
Let's do it.

451
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:09,944
All right, go.

452
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,782
This is the gate.

453
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,617
I don't see a black
woman anywhere.

454
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:17,251
No.

455
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:20,353
I mean, there's her, but...
That's her!

456
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,288
What?

457
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,657
Really? That is not at all
what I was picturing.

458
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:24,357
No.

459
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,792
No, right?

460
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,294
Shadynasty.

461
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,162
Frankie!

462
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:30,997
Oh, my word!

463
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:34,334
Oh, you're still as
beautiful as ever.

464
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,869
What are you doing here?

465
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:40,240
Oh, you know, I wrote to you every
single day from South America.

466
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:42,776
I mean, I really feel like
we could still be together.

467
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,211
There's still a chance for us.

468
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,347
Shadynasty, I'm sorry
for whatever I did.

469
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,582
Please, don't go.

470
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,584
Don't choose Gino, choose me.

471
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,319
No, no, no, you choose me.

472
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,654
I have loved you all my life.

473
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:54,455
No, pick me.

474
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:55,189
No.

475
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:55,989
Our love was strong.

476
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:56,657
We were together.

477
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:57,491
Pick me, pick me.

478
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:58,525
Pick me, Shadynasty.

479
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:02,129
I'm sorry, but I pick him.

480
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,265
Ain't this some shit.

481
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,399
Reggie.

482
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:07,434
Reggie?

483
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,237
Whoa, everyone's a lot fatter
than I was expecting them to be.

484
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:10,937
Yeah.

485
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:14,141
Last time I saw you, Frankie,
you had me sent to jail.

486
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:15,342
But I forgive you.

487
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,743
That's all in the past.

488
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,346
Reggie is your one
and only, huh?

489
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,381
He was all along.

490
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:24,518
But because of you two,
he was always in jail.

491
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,454
I could never be with him.

492
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,022
Excuse me, Mr. Mohamed?

493
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:29,290
Yeah?

494
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,693
Your name came up
on a no-fly list.

495
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:32,961
I need you to come with us.

496
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,162
Oh, hell no.

497
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,131
I'm supposed to be
getting on this flight.

498
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,366
Sir, please cooperate.

499
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:40,836
Listen, I'm getting on that
plane with Shadynasty.

500
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:41,570
That's it.

501
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,738
Let's take him down.

502
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,806
Wait! Oh, hell no!

503
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,274
Times have changed!

504
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,010
It can't still be like this!

505
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,812
Leave him be.

506
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,115
Reggie?! No!

507
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,115
Did you call that in?

508
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:54,116
No, that just happened.

509
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:57,487
Oh... Guess times kind of
haven't changed much, huh?

510
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,589
If I'm being honest,
she looked like shit.

511
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:00,189
Mm.

512
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:00,957
Yeah.

513
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,325
She did not age well at all.

514
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,026
No.

515
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:04,295
Did she ever look good?

516
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:05,729
She was never attractive.

517
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,165
I guess black can crack.

518
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,869
That's still...
still kind of racist.

519
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,870
Yeah, that's racist.

520
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:12,738
Is anybody hungry?

521
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,606
Yeah, I'm hungry.

522
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,507
I'm starving.

523
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:15,641
Well, let's go eat.

524
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,877
Hey, did Frankie ever tell you
about the time that I threw

525
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,646
him off the John
Wanamaker Building?

526
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:21,214
You son of a bitch.

527
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,215
He told us about that.

528
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:23,951
I can't-- I can't listen
to another goddamn story.

529
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,953
I don't want to hear that story.

530
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:37,618
