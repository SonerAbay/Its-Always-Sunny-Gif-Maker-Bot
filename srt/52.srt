1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,808
- Come on Hulk!
- Get em Hulk!

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,347
Come on, Hulk!

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:10,771
I have a question though.

4
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,516
What's going on with Hulk Hogan's hair?

5
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:14,035
It's blond and yet it's silken,

6
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:15,605
like that of a Chinese man.

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,412
Ah yes...

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:18,338
Uh, that is Hulk Hogan's signature's look.

9
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,018
Blonde, Chinese hair...

10
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,400
And skin of a hot dog.

11
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:22,394
It's awesome.

12
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,694
The whole thing's fake,
but it's really awesome.

13
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:27,271
Fake? What the hell are you
talking about, fake? It's not fake.

14
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:29,179
Those guys got bashed and bloody.

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,738
I seen guys get pounded in the ring.

16
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,205
- It's still fake, no dude.

17
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,537
- Charlie, Charlie...

18
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,245
I was there once, I saw a guy

19
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,573
pick up a trash can...

20
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:38,184
Smash it into a guy's head.

21
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:38,978
Blood went everywhere.

22
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,094
Okay, what is going on here?

23
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:42,942
Ohhh Yeah! Right here he's

24
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,716
going into a state of 'Hulkamania'.

25
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,378
Okay, when he's like this,

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,850
nothing can hurt you.

27
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,171
It's like a seizure of strength.

28
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:51,772
Who we got here?

29
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:52,941
Hey sexy!

30
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,756
I can't get you out of my mind.

31
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:56,142
- Who's that addressed to?
- It's...

32
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,398
- Who's Soldier of Fortune?

33
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,319
It's just this guy I been
chatting online with.

34
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,757
- Damn it.

35
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:01,658
So that would make
you Desert Rose.

36
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,008
- Yes it would.
- [Snort]

37
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,701
Wow! What a couple of losers!

38
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:06,655
Ohhh!

39
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:11,121
Oh really... Okay well... This loser that you are
referring to happens to be an American soldier in Iraq.

40
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,945
Back it up. Don't...

41
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:15,076
Don't joke about that.
Are you serious?

42
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,399
In seriousness, this platoon
is coming home his weekend.

43
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,408
And we are going to hang out together.
So suck on that.

44
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:22,852
- I feel terrible.
- Yeah, you should.

45
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,825
I feel terrible too because he's going to
come back from Iraq and he's going.

46
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:28,153
Gonna find out that he's been chatting with...

47
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,886
And then...That's no good...
Nooo... I mean...

48
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:31,207
High suicide rates for this guy.

49
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,183
He's going to be crushed.
...Resemble-manic of a bigger problems guys.

50
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,844
I don't think people are
proud to be Americans anymore.

51
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,286
You know, not like we were in the 80's.

52
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,187
On the 80's we were so patriotic. Oh man!

53
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,910
And when Hogan was doing his thing,

54
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,519
and we were killing Iranians,

55
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,435
or whatever... I mean we were proud!

56
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:46,432
There's no fanfare.

57
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,062
There's no parade.

58
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:49,704
- Girls are tricking troops on the Internet.
- Nope!

59
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:51,018
Nobody is tricking anybody!

60
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,919
You know? We gotta do something about this.

61
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:56,009
Cus... Cus... People just aren't showing
their appreciation for these guys.

62
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,867
We gotta show them the love.
We gotta do something.

63
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,299
Let's step it up!

64
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,312
Let's be the guys that do something for the troops.

65
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,152
Let's put on a show or something.
For reals.

66
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:04,294
Something with a little...

67
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,412
A little pa-zass.

68
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,417
Like a thank you.

69
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,630
- Yeah!
- For all your service.

70
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,057
Something to celebrate the troops. Celebrate American.

71
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,935
Maybe celebrates us.
I'm into that.

72
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,283
I know you are dude. Huh.

73
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:16,469
What's the best way to celebrate America boys?

74
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,721
Wrestling.

75
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:33,659
Season 5 Episode 7
The Gang Wrestles for the Troops

76
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:38,647
Sync, transcript, spellcheck by Ikatic

77
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:10,090
That's how it's...

78
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,899
Yeah, man!
Hey! Hey!

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,239
Thanks, bud. Let it go.

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,221
Hey so I book this venue for Friday night.

81
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:16,881
You got this place?
Yeah bro.

82
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:19,319
I told them it was for the troops.
They gave us a discount.

83
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,070
That is what I'm talking about dude.

84
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,517
People want to support the troops.

85
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,423
They don't have a venue to do it.

86
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,346
How are we going to do that though.

87
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:28,047
None of us know how to wrestle.

88
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,056
Charlie and I do.

89
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:31,935
We used to backyard wrestling all the time dude.

90
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:32,980
We were an awesome tag team.

91
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:34,625
That's right. We're the Pigeon Boys!

92
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,698
Pigeon Boys!

93
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,509
Pigeon Boys?

94
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,245
Doesn't sound that cool now as an adult.
You're right.

95
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:40,809
- We gotta update it.
- O, O, Oh...

96
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,916
- Let's be Eagles dude.

97
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,626
That's like patriotic, it fires on all cylinders.

98
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:47,204
I don't know. I feel like
pigeons are survivors though.

99
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,351
I'm going to side with
Dennis on this one bro.

100
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,649
Hey, what you say we get this guy on the mix.

101
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,519
- You know.
- He probably got some experience.

102
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,264
- He could show us the ropes.

103
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,396
Hey Manic! Mr. Manic! Mr. Manic!

104
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:01,862
- Hold up. Hold up.
- Mr. Manic. Excuse me.

105
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:02,964
- Something I can do for you fellas?

106
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:03,467
Uhhhhh...

107
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,013
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

108
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,197
That was a great show.

109
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:08,214
- That was amazing.
- Dude, that was so awesome.

110
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,086
- Dude, you drank your own blood.

111
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:10,452
- And when you were choking the guy...
- Just trying...

112
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,937
- To put on a good show.
- It was. Yes.

113
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,739
You know... No. No here.
Let me do you a favor here...

114
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,878
You are good kids here.
Hang on... Hang on...

115
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,304
Oh, you got an autograph now

116
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,960
No, we're good man. That's alright.
No, we don't need...

117
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,810
Don't need an autograph man,
we're just crash...

118
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:25,172
God bless you man,
you have a good time. You know well.

119
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,844
This is uh...
Parking ticket.

120
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,691
You betcha. You have fun with it. Okay?

121
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,592
Uh... Uh.. Actually sir. Um...

122
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,125
I don't know if this is too forward to ask you this, but...

123
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:36,250
We're putting on a wrestling match for the troops.

124
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,845
- They're coming home from over seas.

125
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:40,748
And we're thinking that maybe
we can get you to wrestle in it.

126
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,939
How much?
Ohhh.. Ah...

127
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,066
We haven't discuss that.
Ah, how much do you usually charge?

128
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,480
$30 bucks, weekdays.

129
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,638
$50 bucks, weekends...

130
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,469
- Is that it?
- Reasonable.

131
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,585
- That we can do.
- Reasonable.

132
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:52,707
- That we can do.
- Yeah, absolutely.

133
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,081
- Now.
- Okay.

134
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,735
- Now? Alright.
- Give him some money.

135
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:57,055
- Give that to him now.

136
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:09,068
Deandra.

137
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,512
- Yo, Deandra.
- Yes, Frank.

138
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:11,658
- Yes. Yes.
- I can hear you.

139
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,843
What are you doing here?

140
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:14,342
I'm going to use the army guy

141
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,556
to get the word out
about the wrestling match.

142
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,108
Why are you dressed like that?

143
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,116
Well, my chat name is
Desert Rose,

144
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:23,698
so I dressed like a rose, I'm going to
give him a rose, and I'm going to play

145
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,638
Kiss From a Rose by Seal.

146
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:26,867
- I got a whole thing I'm doing here.

147
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,482
- Can you please get out?
*Murmuring*

148
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:30,414
The boys and I...

149
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,573
Got him a little welcome home gift.

150
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,197
Jean shorts?

151
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:36,409
- You bought him a pair of jean shorts?
- Yeah.

152
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,039
Goddamn it Frank, you guys are gonna have plenty
of time to ruin this relationship for

153
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,549
me in some point in the future.

154
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,030
Can you please let me get it started it first?

155
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,665
Hey! Desert Rose!

156
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,658
It's me, Ben!

157
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,092
God, it's so nice to finally
meet you in person.

158
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,317
- Desert Rose.

159
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,539
- Yeah!

160
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:04,387
Ah. No,

161
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,741
Because...

162
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:08,491
I'm not Desert Rose. Ha.

163
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:12,293
I... uh. I am a friend. I am a friend of hers.

164
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,100
Great girl. Uh.

165
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:16,207
She just wanted me to come here

166
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,124
so that I could tell you.

167
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,087
That she wasn't going
to be able to show up here.

168
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,637
Today.

169
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,794
Oh.
Well.

170
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,284
With the.

171
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,172
Dress and the rose,
I thought that...

172
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,248
Uh yea.
Yeah, well of course you thought that.

173
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,570
You thought it
because of this and the.

174
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,608
It's fine. Don't blame yourself.

175
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,483
You're not,
you're not dumb.

176
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:38,672
You're just.
So um.

177
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,242
So.

178
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:41,832
Alright, well.

179
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,685
I uh, wanna invite you to a wrestling match.

180
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,530
Oh. Uh. Thanks.

181
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,625
Guys. We all chipped in to get you these uh,

182
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:04,213
Uh. This is uh,
coming home present.

183
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:10,002
There you go.

184
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,499
And thank you for your service.

185
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,415
I don't give a rat's ass

186
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,465
about your collection agency.

187
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,095
And as for the $15 co-payment....

188
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,268
Eat shit and die!

189
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,196
Ah shit!

190
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:51,481
Sorry, I'm gonna go get grease up and then uh...

191
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:54,224
And come back and rock on...

192
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,359
$15?

193
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,955
He's upset about $15?

194
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:04,099
Yeah, smashing our phone.
Not a lot of money.

195
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,494
Let's move pass it for now.
You know let's..

196
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,708
Focus on our stuff. Let's focus on on...

197
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:11,111
The most important part of
our routine is the entrance.

198
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:13,053
Yes, absolutely.
Bam!

199
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,647
Frank, what the hell are you doing man?

200
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,606
That's my character,

201
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:20,196
I'm the Trash Man.

202
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,458
I come out,

203
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,432
I throw trash all over...
all over the ring...

204
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,817
And then, I start eating garbage.

205
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:28,687
And then I pick up the trash can...

206
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,134
And I,
smash the guy on the head. Oh...

207
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:32,596
That's gonna be a disaster.

208
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:33,951
No, no, nobody's gonna get hurt.

209
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:36,921
I'm telling you, like you said... It's all fake.

210
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,736
But it has nothing to do
with the troops, Frank.

211
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:41,780
A sixty year old man eating trash,
who wants to see that?

212
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,658
Nah, but that's what
people want. Hey...

213
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,913
I got something for you. I got a character for you.

214
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,010
You can be... The ref.

215
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,460
I'm not gonna be the ref.

216
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,601
I'm a villain, don't you see?

217
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,340
Pick up the garbage... and then I uh....

218
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:57,221
- Frank.
- Just nasty dude!

219
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,705
- Are you choking?
- Oh my gosh!

220
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,475
No, throw it up in the bathroom. Get out of here.

221
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,268
Go take a break. Go take a break.

222
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,519
The troops are going to be very happy to see that.

223
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,220
Alright, let's get this...
Let's, let's...

224
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,923
Let's get back to it... Just... Charlie.

225
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:13,786
So we're talking about the entrances okay?

226
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,663
Yeah, we got a good idea. Okay.
We got a good idea.

227
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,434
Alright now, they are going to
announce our name:

228
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:18,977
Birds of War.

229
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:20,738
Oh, I loved that name.
I love it.

230
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:23,122
And yeah, maybe we'll do an eagle
screech.. *Screeching* That'll be great.

231
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,963
And then we'll start out.. We'll
come out of the tunnel, we'll start out.

232
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:33,066
We're gonna write this great song.
It's gonna be how bad ass we are.

233
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,578
You know what I mean.
It's all about the...

234
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,075
About how we soar through the air,
how we live in a nest top.

235
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,861
How we like to protect our eggs from predators.

236
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:41,334
And our young, we regurgitate to our...
All the...

237
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,522
Actually, can I stop you guys for one second?

238
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,158
Because what you just...
described,

239
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,689
Nah, it seems like we're just singing...

240
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,112
About the life style of an eagle. Yeah.

241
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:53,036
Okay, well I was under the impression
that we were presenting ourselves as bird men.

242
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,703
Which, to me... Is infinitely cooler

243
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:57,601
than just sorta being a bird.

244
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,853
No No No... It's good... We can
meet in the middle thou... We can... maybe

245
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:03,339
Maybe... It's just already the middle...
That's all I ask, that's all I ask...

246
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,468
I want people to be able to see
that we're not just birds.

247
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:15,116
Thanks you for stepping in as Desert Rose.

248
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:19,337
Uh, no problem. I dated
a lot of disable men in my past, so...

249
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:20,688
I enjoyed the power. Okay...

250
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,107
Why aren't you wearing red?
I was very specific about that.

251
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,048
- I don't' do red.
- Well, you look like a grape.

252
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,752
Fine, then I'll be Desert Grape.

253
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:28,399
No, he wasn't talking to Desert Grape,

254
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,288
He was talking to Desert Rose,
it's very specific and...

255
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,139
Alright, you know what, alright,

256
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,907
this is what we'll do, just put this here.

257
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:38,795
- Oh, you're sweaty. Oh, Okay.
- It's humid outside.

258
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,349
- So uh, which one is he?

259
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,181
Right behind you in yellow.

260
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,898
- Ah, mama like...
- Cute, right?

261
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,500
Hey, did he send you any dick pics.

262
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,964
Because it could be a mess down there.

263
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,954
For the love of god, please
don't ask him about his dick.

264
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:53,393
Okay, have it your way,
I'll figure it out soon enough.

265
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,787
And away we go.

266
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:01,129
Oh, she looks ridiculous.

267
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:02,728
- Desert Rose?

268
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,038
- Hi

269
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:05,696
What... What the hell?

270
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,437
Oh, it feels so good to finally hold you.

271
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:11,684
Oh you... You're... You're biting
my lips.

272
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:13,513
Hi, oh.

273
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:15,144
What a coincidence.

274
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:17,519
Hey oh, you're the girl
from the bus stop.

275
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,729
- Yes, I am.
- Well, you guys are friends right?

276
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,956
Mmm hmm, not really.

277
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,931
Tell your friend, thank you for the shorts.
They fit great. Yeah?

278
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:27,288
Yeah, will do.
So, what's...

279
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,310
What's the deal with you standing?

280
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,706
I thought there was a
wheelchair and you were in it.

281
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:36,482
Oh no, no I... I twisted my knee
getting of a plane in Germany.

282
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,414
I'm uh. I was just trying to stay off
of it. Mmm, it's good now, you see?

283
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:43,401
Yes it is. Can I talk to you for a sec?

284
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,802
I'll be back. What is it? What, what?

285
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,321
I changed my mind, so move out of
the way so I can swoop in. Nah Uh...

286
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:50,376
- No chang-ies.
- What?

287
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,882
Artemis, I'm warning you, if you don't get out of the
way right now. I'm going to bring out the big guns.

288
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:57,343
Oh, hit me with your best shot you stupid bitch!

289
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:05,767
I was looking around, I was thinking...

290
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,455
I... I brought some...

291
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,906
You just...
I'm sorry for that. You just...

292
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:13,730
I... just props I thought I was bringing.

293
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:16,029
That is not a prop though, that's sharp razor wires.

294
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:20,028
Mr. Manic, we were thinking that maybe
we could go a little more traditional with it.

295
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:23,141
You know just, figure 4 leg lock, pile driver...

296
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:25,191
Hey, off the top... suplex...
Oh, no no...

297
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:29,015
People, that old school bullshit...
That, that don't play no more you know.

298
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,732
- Really?
- Yeah, it's gotta be gruesome, you know?

299
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,678
Those people, they like blood you know and...

300
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,473
Yes, well guys like you...

301
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:39,574
You know what, I love you guys man...

302
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,282
You know, you remind me of my kids...

303
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:44,349
Oh, you got kids Maniac?

304
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,539
Nah, not anymore.

305
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,900
What does that mean?

306
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:57,481
- Okay, alright
- We got a problem...

307
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,486
I don't know...
What... what was he talking about with his kids?

308
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,304
Did he killed his kids?
He just...

309
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,606
Drifted away and uh...

310
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,913
Look at it, look at this, I feel
like he's living out of his car right?

311
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,093
I mean he's got blankets in there.
What is that? A pile of laundry...

312
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:08,379
Look at this dude,

313
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:09,807
that's just a bucket of chestnuts.

314
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:12,461
What, is he just foraging for his food?

315
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,318
I don't know why the hell would
you have a bucket of chestnuts, bro?

316
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,419
We are dealing with a legitimate maniac now.

317
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,247
That is clear to me, his mania is not confined to the ring.

318
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,227
No, he kept calling you the N word earlier.

319
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:24,123
Yea, I didn't, I wasn't gonna bring that up,
I don't' want to freak him out.

320
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:25,529
Me?
Yes, Yes.

321
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,831
He was calling me the N word.

322
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:28,139
Every time you turned your back.

323
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,973
He's like you stupid N, go get me grease.

324
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,319
- And this and that.
- Why?

325
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,228
I don't' know, did he say why?
He has a problem with...

326
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:35,104
Black people and he likes to...
Why does he have a problem with me?

327
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,685
I mean I don't understand.
Both, I think...

328
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:38,098
Oh my god, okay.

329
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,445
Let's get rid of him.
Let's get rid of him, thats it.

330
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:40,747
How you get rid of a guy like that?

331
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,004
I don't want to be anywhere in the ring with that guy.

332
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,074
You know what?
What if we were just hype men?

333
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,414
We don't even go in the ring.

334
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:47,716
Yes, we let him do the wrestling.

335
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,128
- We do not wrestle?
- No.

336
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,129
Alright, we gotta find someone for him to wrestle though.

337
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,432
Right right. Okay.

338
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,040
Someone who has like...

339
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,075
You know nothing to lose, right?

340
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:01,797
- Cricket.
- That's out Cricket.

341
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,321
- Yeah.
- Cricket.

342
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,222
No.

343
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,561
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

344
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:10,228
We want you to wrestle at a
wrestling match that we're gonna throw.

345
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,926
No, how about that?

346
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,041
I'm not gonna participate in your little games and schemes.

347
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,652
Cricket, how about this?
It's for the troops.

348
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,133
I don't give a shit about the troops.

349
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:22,254
- We'll gonna pay you, bro.
- That's pay involved.

350
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,234
Oh, you should have thought about that, Cricket.

351
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:26,506
- You paying?
- Oh, yea man.

352
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:29,644
Oh I see, so what, am I gonna get my ass kick?

353
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,384
It's wrestling,
it's all fake.

354
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:33,840
It's relatively fake.

355
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,150
What happens in the ring,
happens in the ring, Cricket.

356
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:38,235
It's really up to you.

357
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,754
I don't feel we're reading as eagles.

358
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,598
No bro, we look like assholes.

359
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,491
It didn't turn out the way I had envisioned.

360
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:52,602
I'm getting more of a chicken vibe.

361
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,678
- What in gods name is this about?
- Alright, alright, don't start...

362
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,568
We're Bird Man, we're Birds Of War.

363
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,469
- Bird-Men?
- What do you want? What do you want?

364
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,444
Okay uh, I wanna sing the star
spangle banner before the match.

365
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:07,014
Yeah, good sing.
We don't' care.

366
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:10,078
Do whatever you want. Just get away. We obviously in
the middle of something. Get away. Get away. Yeah.

367
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,642
- Get outta here!

368
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:13,894
Whoa, whoa, wait a sec,
do that again.

369
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,355
That?

370
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:17,416
- That looks pretty cool.
- Maybe we can go with the chicken thing.

371
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:18,985
- Ah, no no, we're not going with the chicken...
- The chicken boys!

372
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,822
- We're not changing the songs.
- Got big problems with The Maniac!

373
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:23,867
Big problem with The Maniac.

374
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,923
Oh, what the hell did he do?
Did he kill somebody?

375
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,705
- Unpaid parking tickets.
- Unpaid parking tickets?

376
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:32,081
- Manic.
- Oh my boy. My boys.

377
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,476
Wait wait wait wait wait...

378
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,314
You know what,

379
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,559
The Manic loves you.

380
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,149
Even with your...
Wait, wait.

381
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,540
Even with your f...
I love you.

382
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,527
We love you too, man.

383
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,579
- Poor guy.
- I don't love him. I don't love him at all

384
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,900
You guys need a wrestler now.

385
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,030
We should take The Trash Man out of retirement.

386
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,669
That is not gonna happen, Frank.

387
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,500
He's right, we do need a wrestler.
I know.

388
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,518
Guys, I'm thinking that maybe we should do it.
Yeah.

389
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,777
Right? We got the costumes, we got the passion!

390
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:04,418
- We are just... Battling Cricket.
- Just Cricket.

391
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,239
Alright, Pigeon Boys!
Let's do this!

392
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,541
No, we're not the Pigeon Boys.

393
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,352
- Birds of War.
- Chicken Boys!

394
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:11,517
- Are we sticking with the Eagles.
- Yes, we're Birds of War.

395
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,357
- Let's just go with Bird.
- We don't' even look like eagles.

396
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,815
What kind of bird would we be?

397
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:23,753
And now, the moment you all been waiting for.

398
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:29,678
Introducing America's most hated terrorist.

399
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,459
The Taliban.

400
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:38,407
America sucks!

401
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:41,496
The terrorists rule.
Ah la la la!

402
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:44,226
Ladies and gentlemen,

403
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:48,398
get ready to take flight with...

404
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:51,201
The Birds of War.

405
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,564
What's up America.

406
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,070
Hey troops! Hi guys!

407
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,050
Drop a beat for us.
You ready?

408
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:01,452
Go! Clap! So so Clap! So clap!

409
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,574
The eagles are out of ...

410
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,550
It flies through the night...

411
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:17,786
Don't you mess with it's heads now....

412
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,373
Or you'll see a fight.

413
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:24,361
Yes, we have feathers, ah!

414
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,038
But the muscles are man.

415
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:31,921
Ahh ahhh ah, cos we're Birds of War now!

416
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:35,397
But we're also mans!

417
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,977
Birds of War!

418
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,917
They are not responding to the pageantry at all.

419
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,528
The new second verse is completely ridiculous.

420
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,022
The second verse is
necessary to clarify...

421
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,259
- Clarify what we are.
- We're Mic, we're Mic-ed.

422
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,716
- The microphones are on.
- Are they hearing us?

423
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:55,235
- Do the routine.
- Go!

424
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,587
The crow thing, the crow thing...

425
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,693
No no cut it, cut it.

426
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,359
Not that one, I'm not doing that one.

427
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,372
Flip the tape over, the other song.

428
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:21,429
This one goes out to a very special soldier.

429
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,806
A Soldier of Fortune.

430
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:26,160
I'm your real Desert Rose.

431
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,463
That strange woman
you been hanging out with.

432
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,081
She's an impostor.

433
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:32,252
Baby...

434
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,255
Yeah, bitch!

435
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,606
She is a slut!

436
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,731
You, you broke my nose.

437
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:43,441
Yea Taliban!
Ah la la la!

438
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:46,972
- So, what do we do? What do we?
- I think it started.

439
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:51,395
Go go ahead. Jump in the ring and fight Cricket.

440
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,069
I'm going, I'm going to get a little rough with you, okay?

441
00:18:57,412 --> 00:19:00,653
Oh, what is that? Sand?
Oh, Jesus Christ.

442
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:07,947
- Oh come on ref. Is that even legal?
- I didn't see nothing.

443
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,929
Yo, Cricket gone crazy man.

444
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,301
- Shit, we can't let the Taliban win.
- Alright, alright I got it.

445
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:15,797
Alright Cricket, you son of a bitch,
you think you're so tough huh?

446
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:18,428
Stop throwing sand!
Stop!

447
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:20,118
Come on, bitch!
You want some?

448
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,671
I feel like if I come in there...

449
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,496
You're just gonna throw sand in my eyes,
so I'm gonna run away.

450
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:30,226
America sucks! Terrorist rules!
Yay!

451
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,734
- Stop, you got me.
- The Trash Man!

452
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:39,393
Oh shit, are you okay Cricket?

453
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,855
I must had an itch.

454
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:18,492
I knew this shit wasn't fake.

455
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:19,892
