1
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:04,492
So what do you
guys wanna do today?

2
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:06,023
- I don't know.
- We could sing a song.

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:07,145
We just ate.

4
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,247
We're drinking.

5
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,314
Hey, you know what?

6
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:12,152
Mac's coming over here pretty soon...
Mac's always got something...

7
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:13,656
He'll have a plan...
He always has something.

8
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:15,059
And he'll get us
into something good.

9
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,792
He comes in with something.

10
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:16,526
He comes in hot.

11
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:17,293
That'll be perfect.

12
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,760
'Cause I feel like we're having a hard
time getting into something good today.

13
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:20,560
There he is! There he is!

14
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,326
Good timing!

15
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:23,062
Mac in the house.

16
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:23,798
Mac in the house.

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,599
Mac in the house.

18
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,870
Got some news?

19
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:27,738
Got some news for me?

20
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,504
Lay it on us.

21
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,306
What's the news?

22
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:30,042
What's your news?

23
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:30,742
No, what's your news?

24
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:31,577
Give us the news.

25
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,344
Oh, I don't have any news.

26
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:33,078
I thought you guys had news.

27
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,779
You always come
in hot with news.

28
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,512
Yeah, what's the plan?

29
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,279
Oh. I got nothin'.

30
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,079
Really?

31
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,046
Huh? Oh.

32
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:38,713
That's disappointing.

33
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,215
You usually fire in
here with something.

34
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,049
Yeah.

35
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,550
I've actually been
kinda bored today.

36
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:43,317
We're bored over here.

37
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:44,018
You guys bored, too?

38
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,187
We are bored out of
our goddamn minds.

39
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,457
You got no plan?
Didn't run into a thing or...?

40
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:51,393
♪ Don't you remember, love
We built this city...

41
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,296
We built this city on
rock 'n' roll... ♪

42
00:00:56,298 --> 00:01:00,566
Oh... wait... guys...
I know what we can do.

43
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:01,733
You do?

44
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:05,770
Let's play "Chardee MacDennis."

45
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:06,804
Yes! Yes!

46
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:07,772
No! No!

47
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,906
No, no... No!
'Cause we're not playing!

48
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:10,907
Yes!

49
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,742
What's
"Chardee MacDennis"?

50
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:13,609
Oh, my God.

51
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,644
"Chardee MacDennis" is an awesome
board game that we came

52
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,845
up with, many years ago,
on a day much like today.

53
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:18,946
That sounds like fun.

54
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:20,982
No, we're not playing it!

55
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:21,950
We're not playing it!

56
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:24,853
Don't start chanting it, 'cause
we're not playing that stupid game!

57
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,722
We are not playing that game!

58
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:27,991
Why? What's the big deal?

59
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,258
It's only a game.

60
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,895
It's not just a game!

61
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,897
It's a war.

62
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:04,877
"Chardee MacDennis: The Game of Games."
Now what we did is we took

63
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,365
our favorite aspects of a bunch
of different board games and we

64
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,466
mashed 'em all together.

65
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,368
We did the same thing with the name,
'cause we couldn't agree upon one.

66
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,637
Now, the point of the game is
actually quite simple: It's a

67
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,894
race to the finish from
Level One to Level Three.

68
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,659
This is the board, and we start
at Level One, which is "Mind."

69
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:20,288
That consists of "Trivia,"

70
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:21,681
"Puzzles" and "Artistry."

71
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,752
It is also the level at which the
alcohol being consumed is wine.

72
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:26,419
Whoa!

73
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,110
You get to drink
during the game?

74
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,331
Uh, drinking is the game, Frank.
It's the whole point of it.

75
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,850
I'm not going to play any game in
which I'm not getting annihilated.

76
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,401
Moving on to Level Two, which is
"Body": "Physical Challenge,"

77
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:37,677
"Pain" and "Endurance."

78
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:38,829
That's the beer level.

79
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:42,253
Yes, and Level Three is
"Spirit": "Emotional Battery"

80
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:43,519
and "Public Humiliation."

81
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,037
Boom-- hard alcohol level.

82
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,062
What the hell you
doing, Deandra?

83
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,691
Oh, this is very
important, Frank.

84
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,426
We gotta nail the board down to
the bar, because, at a certain

85
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:54,828
point during the game, Mac can get
very pissed off, 'cause he's

86
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,929
not doing very well.

87
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,274
He's gonna try and
flip the board over.

88
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,540
He's right; it's for the best.

89
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,274
I will forget, later,
that it's nailed down.

90
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,754
- He will.
- Okay, here's the big one:

91
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,781
There's a 15-minute
time limit to the game.

92
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,766
15 minutes doesn't seem like
a long time for a game.

93
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,735
Well, there's a fair amount
of a clock stoppages.

94
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:10,271
Yeah, each team gets three
time-outs; there's a half-time;

95
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,573
post-level breaks; a two-minute
warning and a significant amount

96
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:13,774
of injury stoppages.

97
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,941
Hence the first-aid kit.

98
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,677
Now, pay very close attention
to this first part: Each team

99
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,680
must collect a certain number of
cards, at each level, in order

100
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:22,014
to progress to the next level.

101
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,750
And the first team to complete
all three levels wins the game.

102
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:27,419
And the winner-- ooh-- the
winner gets a sweet prize.

103
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,820
Nice!

104
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,122
What's the prize?

105
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:32,658
The winner gets to smash the
other team's game pieces.

106
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,892
That's the prize?

107
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,462
You get to smash the
team's game pieces?

108
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,931
Oh, it's incredibly gratifying.

109
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,366
Oh, it's awesome, Frank.

110
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:41,567
Now these are our game pieces.

111
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,702
Nice, right?

112
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:47,407
- And...  these....
- are Mac and Charlie's pieces.

113
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,411
Look at the condition
that they're in.

114
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,780
Pretty pathetic, as you can see
from the state that these pieces

115
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:56,784
are in, Mac and Charlie have never, ever,
in the history of Chardee MacDennis,

116
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,820
won the game.

117
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,921
You never won?

118
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,023
Never won once?

119
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,058
No.

120
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,293
It's almost statistically
impossible to play that many

121
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,762
games and never win, but...
It's truly an anomaly.

122
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,799
We haven't won yet, all right?
But maybe this is our time, all right?

123
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,500
I mean, yeah, it
is gonna happen.

124
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,467
Watch out! Watch out!

125
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,002
Yeah... I'm gonna slit throats.

126
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,803
Nice.

127
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:15,670
Ack! I love this game!

128
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,738
I want in!

129
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,673
Okay, I want to be Mac
and Charlie's partner.

130
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,540
That seems fair to me.

131
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:20,641
Mm-hmm.

132
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,544
And I'll say why: Because, you
see, Frank's mind is still

133
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,447
fairly strong, but his body's very,
very weak, so I think it's a wash.

134
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,282
And his spirit's garbage,
so I'm okay with it, too.

135
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,517
Hang on a second, dude.

136
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,651
You can't just
jump on our team.

137
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,020
Let us talk about this.

138
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,422
All right, first of all, we
got a team photo, right?

139
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,357
Yeah.

140
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,292
So we're gonna have to decide,
you know, do we get a

141
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,162
new team photo with or without you...
Plus, we have a whole new

142
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:43,700
strategy to come up with, you know...
Our strategy has never worked.

143
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:44,534
And I hate the team photo.

144
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:45,368
Okay, you know what?

145
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,269
Just join our team.

146
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,503
You're on the team.

147
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,438
Yeah!

148
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,106
Don't touch me.

149
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,140
Don't touch me.

150
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,843
Yes, and the Golden Geese are
very much looking forward to

151
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,178
another annihilation.

152
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,115
Yes, we are. Now... in the spirit of
tradition, I propose that we begin the

153
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,284
ritual of sportsmanship.

154
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,693
Good luck to you, sir.

155
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,428
And you, sir.

156
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,096
I do hope you have
a good game, miss.

157
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:14,931
And you, sir.

158
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,666
Why the hell are youse
talkin' like that?

159
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,501
Well, this is an important
part of the process, Frank.

160
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,537
Gives the illusion of
respect for your opponent.

161
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,639
Things are about to get real
dark, real quick, Frank.

162
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:24,875
It's nice to start off
on a positive note.

163
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:27,345
Oh, that reminds me: Once the
game begins, you are not allowed

164
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:28,346
to ask any questions.

165
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:31,949
Yes! In fact, if you do, don't
say a question, look it up

166
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,418
in the book of rules, okay?

167
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,586
Jesus Christ!

168
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,287
Oh, I think I understand.

169
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,891
No, you haven't begun to understand,
Frank, but that's okay.

170
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,193
You'll get it as we go along.

171
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,327
Like every other board game.

172
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,395
Dee, how much time?

173
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:44,797
Uh, ten seconds.

174
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,031
Ah! Perfect!

175
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:50,002
Okay, gentlemen... Suck my dick.

176
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,885
What the shit are you doing?

177
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,621
Goddamn it, Frank.

178
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,089
You asked a question!

179
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,357
Goddamn it!

180
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,826
Frank, Mac, Charlie--
drink for five seconds.

181
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,027
Yeah, drink, drink, drink!

182
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,129
This is how we get psyched
up before each level.

183
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,031
Yeah, that's our
Maori war dance.

184
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,599
That's how we demonstrate
intimidation.

185
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,334
Shows off our physical prowess!

186
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,069
All right, Dee, put two
more minutes on the clock.

187
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:26,903
Let's go.

188
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:28,439
Yep.

189
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,941
Gentlemen... Level One begins.

190
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,981
Okay, first card is trivia.

191
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,284
Okay, Dee, answer this question
correctly, we get the card.

192
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:40,218
Yeah.

193
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,920
If not, they get a
chance to steal.

194
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:42,687
Yes.

195
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,289
All right, what is the
greatest band in the world?

196
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,090
Chumbawamba.

197
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,024
Correct!

198
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:46,925
Nice!

199
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:47,726
Whoa! That's not trivia!

200
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:48,660
That doesn't make sense.

201
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,728
We made up all these questions, Frank,
so there's gonna be a lot of opinion.

202
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,496
Yeah, really, it's more of a
memory game than anything else.

203
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,097
But drink.

204
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:53,898
Drink, bitch. Let's go.

205
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,531
All right, whatever.

206
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,432
Our turn. Our turn.

207
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,333
Here we go. Ready, Charlie?

208
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:57,334
Yeah.

209
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:00,970
No puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles,
no puzzles, no puzzles... Trivia!

210
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,138
Trivia!

211
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,206
I can do trivia, baby.

212
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,941
Oh, dude, and you
definitely wrote this one.

213
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:06,875
Nice. Lay it on me!

214
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,077
Lay it on me!

215
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,513
Question: "Dennis is asshole.

216
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,515
Why Charlie hate"?

217
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,055
I don't think I wrote that.

218
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:21,158
You definitely wrote
this one, Charlie.

219
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,826
Who else would
have written this?

220
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,962
I'm not remembering that.

221
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:25,663
Oh, my God.

222
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:26,998
I don't think I wrote that one.

223
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,765
Of course you did.

224
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,166
How many other illiterates
are in the...?

225
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,801
Just throw out a guess.

226
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:31,369
Pass.

227
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,069
No!

228
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:32,703
Pass, pass.

229
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,704
No, he didn't pass,
he didn't pass.

230
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:35,605
Just throw out a guess.

231
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,607
Any guess, come on.

232
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:40,009
Pass.

233
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:40,910
Son of a bitch!

234
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:41,477
Oh, Charlie.

235
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:42,345
I can't think of one.

236
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,346
All right, chance to steal.

237
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,614
Because Dennis is a bastard man.

238
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,483
That's what it is.

239
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,184
I definitely wrote that.

240
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,018
That was it, right?

241
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,787
Two card, two cards, two cards.

242
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,690
I was mad at you about
something, I wrote that.

243
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:55,590
Doesn't matter.

244
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:56,391
The next card is Artistry.

245
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,792
And it's all play, so
pay attention, guys.

246
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,927
All play, all play.

247
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,094
We can get it back.

248
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,362
"The artist from your team must
draw the clue from the card

249
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,631
on your teammate's back.

250
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:08,169
The teammate must guess the
clue based solely on feel."

251
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,237
You ready?

252
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,705
I'm going to pass the
card over to the drawer.

253
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:11,439
I draw, I draw.

254
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,276
Yeah, I don't want
to have to read it.

255
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,377
Oh, this is hard.

256
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,279
All right, ready... and...
You guys ready?

257
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:17,947
Yeah.

258
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:18,548
...begin.

259
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,549
Go, go, go, go, go.

260
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,483
Hey, go.

261
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:21,651
Uh, uh, bird?

262
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:22,686
I'm not getting it, dude.

263
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,588
That's because it's
impossible to draw.

264
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,457
I don't know how to dr...
Jesus, Dee, your back is so

265
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,059
boney and crooked and all over the
place, I can't get a flat surface.

266
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:29,693
Anger.

267
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,260
Let me have it.

268
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:31,027
Let Frank go.

269
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,528
Let me try it.

270
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,497
Oh, if only the answer was ribs.

271
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:37,300
Go, Frank, give me...
Kicking, kicking.

272
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,469
He got it.

273
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:39,637
He got it!

274
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,738
Son of a bitch.

275
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,139
Kicking, kicking.

276
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:45,642
Yeah, I forgot about your stupid
strange connection with each other.

277
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,010
We get the card, we
get the the card.

278
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:49,779
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink.

279
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,948
No puzzles, no puzzles,
no puzzles, no puzzles.

280
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,816
Chance.

281
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,017
Chance.

282
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,085
This is a great one, Frank.

283
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:56,586
We stole this straight
from Monopoly.

284
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:58,555
It could be good,
it could be bad.

285
00:08:58,557 --> 00:08:59,389
That's the chance.

286
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,857
Got it.

287
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,892
Oh, it's like the best one.

288
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,694
"Take the money from
everyone's pockets."

289
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:07,030
No!

290
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:09,699
Foo-foo, fork over, foo-foo.

291
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,067
That's the best card there is.

292
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:12,836
Frank, I don't know what
you're so excited for.

293
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:13,870
Give me your money.

294
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,339
What, I'm on your team.

295
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:19,109
Frank, the card says "Take the
money from everyone's pockets."

296
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,544
Everyone. You are everyone.

297
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,412
Charlie gave up his 50...
I got $500 in my pocket.

298
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:23,613
I'm not putting my
money on the table.

299
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:24,281
You got to do it, dude.

300
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:24,815
Give it to me.

301
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:25,448
That's the game.

302
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,950
That's a part of
the game, Frank.

303
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:27,551
Let me see that card.

304
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:29,353
No, if you're going to play the game...
Let me see that card.

305
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,121
If you're going to play the game...
Let me see the card!

306
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,423
That's not a part of the game.

307
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,157
Why don't you show him the card.

308
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,127
Let him see the card.

309
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,362
"Swallow this card whole."

310
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:40,830
Cheating! Cheating!

311
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:41,631
Cheating.

312
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:42,465
You've been caught cheating.

313
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,532
Time's up.

314
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:44,700
You've been caught cheating.

315
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,168
We're on the same team, dude.

316
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,138
Look, Frank, cheating is
tolerated, it's accepted, it's

317
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,573
like a big part of the game, but
if you get caught cheating, they

318
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:52,808
advance to the next level.

319
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,310
You ruined my scheme.

320
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,912
Well, you know, in his defense, you
were trying to steal his money.

321
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:57,479
Yeah.

322
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,714
It was not the time
to cheat, dude.

323
00:09:58,716 --> 00:09:59,348
Enjoy that.

324
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,181
Only one card down.

325
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,649
Yeah, well, it's too late now.

326
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,350
What's done is done.

327
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:02,951
Uh-oh.

328
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:06,187
So...

329
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

330
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,161
To the Game of Games.

331
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:14,963
Yes, Frank, good,
you're getting it.

332
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,198
Very civil.

333
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,805
Can questions now I ask
that clock stop-ed?

334
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,742
Okay, just 'cause you jumble up the
words doesn't make it not a question.

335
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:25,542
But the answer is yes.

336
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:29,046
When the clock is stopped, all
rules are off and civility reigns.

337
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:30,147
They advance, do we?

338
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,282
Ah, yes, I'll explain
it to you, Frank.

339
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,516
It can get a little confusing.

340
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:35,352
They are now in Level Two.

341
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,721
Which means they need only two
cards to advance to Level Three.

342
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:39,922
We are still in Level One.

343
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,490
It's a goddamn mind boggler.

344
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,325
Yeah, I've never really
understood it, but the point is,

345
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,361
if Mac's telling you
what to do, listen.

346
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:46,395
Okay.

347
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,798
Now at Level Two, there
is no more cursing.

348
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,532
Oh, yeah.

349
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,867
Big-time Level Two rule.

350
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:51,868
All right, where we at here?

351
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,502
Where we at?

352
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,972
Oh, gentlemen, it's time.

353
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:55,873
Oh, is it?

354
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,875
Kick it!

355
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:08,765
You flinch, you lose.

356
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:08,834
Here we go.

357
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:13,277
Didn't wince, all right.

358
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,347
Nothing. Not even a...
All right.

359
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,681
Oh!

360
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:17,649
Aw, come on.

361
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,617
Nothing.

362
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,253
The problem is his hands are like...
So tiny.

363
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,156
If Dee had gotten this, we could have just...
Obliterated those giant paws.

364
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:24,857
All right, I got him.

365
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,225
I'm going to put it right
in the center of his hand.

366
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,493
Do it, do it.

367
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,461
Cheese and crepes!

368
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:31,431
All right, hit him, hit him!

369
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,465
Dadgumit!

370
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,499
Let me have a go at it.

371
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,502
Yeah, here.

372
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:39,205
Oh!

373
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,374
Wait for it.

374
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,377
Wait for it.

375
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:48,782
Cheese and crepes.

376
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:49,450
Son of a gun.

377
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,452
Cheese and crepes!

378
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,427
Dee, we'll be taking this card.

379
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,128
Cheese and crow.

380
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,828
All right, it's our turn.

381
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,663
Let's go get the cards.

382
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:01,630
Let's do it.

383
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,566
No, puzzles, no, puzzles, no
puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles,

384
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:08,003
no puzzles, no puzzles, no
puzzles, no puzzles... Chance.

385
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,771
All right, okay.

386
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,539
Okay, could be good,
could be bad.

387
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,407
"Go to jail.

388
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:13,474
Do not pass Go.

389
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,209
Do not collect $200."

390
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,110
Sam of a bush.

391
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,879
Okay, we take our pieces,
we put them in jail.

392
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,813
Oh, no, no, no, no.

393
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,014
Frank, see, you don't get it.

394
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,415
There's no jail on the board.

395
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:25,519
So you go in there.

396
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,221
You got to be kidding me.

397
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,190
No, jail's a dog kennel.

398
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,326
You can get out, but you're
not going to like how.

399
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,327
You got to eat a cake.

400
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,662
That's sounds good.

401
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:35,596
It's not.

402
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,799
You have to eat the
ingredients of a cake.

403
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:38,833
Aw, shit.

404
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,135
One, by one... Oh! No!

405
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:40,803
Oh!

406
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:41,370
Stop the clock!

407
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,338
Dude!

408
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,874
Aw, I hate this game.

409
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:46,609
I hate this game.

410
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,945
All right, all right, all right,
we drink for five seconds.

411
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,313
No, you're not getting it.

412
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,816
In Level Two, the
other team counts.

413
00:12:55,818 --> 00:13:06,426
Four... five.

414
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,934
Awful.

415
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,402
No more cursing.

416
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:15,336
No more cursing.

417
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,404
Get in jail.

418
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:17,939
Let's go.

419
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,141
You might want to brush up on
some of these rules while you're

420
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:20,709
in there too, pal.

421
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:21,476
Yeah.

422
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:22,177
That's a good idea.

423
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,078
Let him read the rule book.

424
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,213
All right, our turn.

425
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,481
Ooh, I'll play.

426
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,684
"Physical challenge--
The Grape Gobble."

427
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:29,818
Oh, nice.

428
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,553
Grape Gobble's my thing, man.

429
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:35,123
Charlie's favorite board
game-- Hungry Hungry Hippos.

430
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,459
Ready, set, go.

431
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:38,827
Go, go, go.

432
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,462
Go, Charlie, go, Charlie.

433
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:42,397
Put my cage on the
bar so I can see.

434
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,498
Shut up, dog.

435
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,766
Gobble, gobble, come on.

436
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:46,600
Come on, Dee, go, go, go.

437
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:47,601
And time.

438
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:48,202
Ho! Ho!

439
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:49,403
That's time.

440
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,437
Oh, no.

441
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,271
It's only five.

442
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:51,939
I only got five.

443
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:52,673
Oh, sheets!

444
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:53,307
Bed sheets!

445
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,142
Yeah!

446
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:55,610
You definitely got
more than five!

447
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:56,444
Yeah, yeah!

448
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:57,912
I ate, like, 12!

449
00:13:57,914 --> 00:13:59,280
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

450
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:00,948
You're not supposed to eat them.

451
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,618
Th-The rule is you're supp...
You're not supposed to eat them.

452
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,021
There's no way we can tell how many you...

453
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:06,955
We win the level.

454
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:07,756
We have Big Bubble.

455
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:08,658
We get the card!

456
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,325
Level three!

457
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:10,093
Level three now!

458
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,561
Wait, they're still inside me!

459
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:12,295
I can get them out!

460
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:12,895
Doesn't matter!

461
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,266
Golden Geese!

462
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:17,333
Golden Geese!

463
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:20,503
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

464
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,974
We move on to Level Three!

465
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,141
I hate this game!

466
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:25,909
I hate this game!

467
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:26,643
Oh, now this part.

468
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:27,710
Okay. Oh, yes.

469
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,012
Know this game.

470
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:31,314
Board flipping, cheating.

471
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,456
I'm so sick from
that cake stuff.

472
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,325
Well, you shouldn't have even
eaten it, man, 'cause the game's

473
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,060
gonna be over in,
like, a second.

474
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:45,794
They're gonna kill us.

475
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,096
Hold on a second.

476
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:48,230
I got a plan.

477
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:51,900
When I was in the cage,
I had the books.

478
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:52,935
Save it, Frank.

479
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,870
There's no way we can
beat them, okay?

480
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:57,140
They are tailor-made
for level three.

481
00:14:57,142 --> 00:15:00,077
Last time we played, Dee got
"Emotional Battery," we berated

482
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,578
that bitch for, like,
two straight hours.

483
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,781
I mean, really personal stuff.

484
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,648
Way over the line.

485
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,883
The kind of stuff that cuts
you to the core, you know.

486
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,885
She held it together
without a single tear.

487
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,288
Dude, when her two minutes were up,
she cried for a month straight.

488
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,989
Yeah, it was really sad.

489
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,690
Every day, crying all day long.

490
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:16,125
She talked about
taking too many pills.

491
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:17,726
I think she tried
to kill herself.

492
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:18,426
She did, she did.

493
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,261
I saw it, but I didn't
tell you about it.

494
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:22,964
Are you bitches
ready for round three?

495
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:25,265
'Cause you're
going down, clowns.

496
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,916
Dennis, I want
to tell you something.

497
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:36,517
Yeah?

498
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,454
I hope I get "Emotional
Battery" this time, from them,

499
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:43,925
because this is why-- you guys,
you always emotional batter me.

500
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,760
And I'm gonna,
I'm fine with it.

501
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:46,695
And I don't care about it.

502
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,430
I'm getting good at it now.

503
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,600
So that's something that
I hope for this game.

504
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,101
Okay.

505
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,202
Let me help you with that.

506
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,403
Oh, Frank.

507
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:55,104
Frank, come on!

508
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,840
Okay, so I broke another rule.

509
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:57,374
Oh, you did?

510
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:58,008
You broke a rule?

511
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,877
Don't rat us out if it's a rule!

512
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,011
Probably not a rule.

513
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:01,712
Let's keep playing.

514
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:02,580
It probably is a rule.

515
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:03,514
I don't think it's a rule.

516
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:04,215
I think it is.

517
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:08,754
Rule 463: When a player
spills his or her drink, his

518
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,157
or her team has to chug
the opponent's drinks.

519
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,224
Oh!

520
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,759
You are a terrible,
terrible teammate.

521
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,095
I don't want to chug hard alcohol
on top of all this wine.

522
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,230
It's like... No, that's okay,
you don't have to do it.

523
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,165
You don't have to, because
you guys are in Level One.

524
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,967
You can't even drink
hard alcohol, anyway.

525
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:22,901
You're trying to trick us.

526
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:24,970
They're trying to trick us
'cause then we'll not drink it

527
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:26,705
and it'll be a rule that
we had to drink it.

528
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:27,772
No, no, it's fine.

529
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:28,407
No tricking us.

530
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:29,641
Hey, we're playing the game.

531
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:30,509
We're playing the game.

532
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,712
It's Chardee MacDennis.

533
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,215
This tastes like water.

534
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,149
This is water.

535
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:39,585
Aha! I knew it!

536
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,387
Well... I knew it was water.

537
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:45,057
When he threw his beer in
my face, I could taste it.

538
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,528
Shut up, dog!

539
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,162
Cheaters!

540
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:50,630
Yeah... Cheaters.

541
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:51,731
You've been cheating!

542
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:52,965
We caught you cheating!

543
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,233
Eff you in the A!

544
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:55,301
Eff you in the A!

545
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:57,836
Congratulations, all right?

546
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,171
Fudge on crackers, all right?

547
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:00,272
Mr. Falconing sons of birds!

548
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:03,375
Mother fathers, you've caught
us cheating for the first time

549
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,710
in, like, 18 games.

550
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:09,047
If the team ahead gets caught
cheating, then the team behind

551
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,851
jumps to their level, which means...
Level Three!

552
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:14,619
Level Three!

553
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:15,620
Level Three!

554
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,055
Okay.

555
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,592
We've never been to
Level Three before!

556
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:21,659
I'm going to Level Three!

557
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:22,693
I'll see you in Level Three!

558
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:23,661
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

559
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:28,801
♪ The team going to Level Three We are
the team going to Level Three... ♪

560
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,373
That was the buzzer.

561
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,207
Oh.

562
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,143
The timer's never
gone off before.

563
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,344
Well, so what does that mean?

564
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,980
Wait, look that up, because you
guys always win before the

565
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:46,754
timer goes off, so...
It means we have to draw the black card.

566
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,555
I don't remember a black card.

567
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:49,255
There's a black card?

568
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:49,889
I don't remember.

569
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:51,691
I don't remember a
black card at all.

570
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,860
Black-- guys, this could be
some dark shit right here.

571
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:54,494
Here it is.

572
00:17:54,496 --> 00:17:57,130
This is gonna be a
battle to the death.

573
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,398
Ooh!

574
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,099
Ooh, that's scary.

575
00:17:59,101 --> 00:17:59,966
All right, read it.

576
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,401
Open it, open it,
open it, open it!

577
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:01,935
Brace yourself.

578
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:02,602
Get ready.

579
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:03,570
Here I go.

580
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,005
Huh? What... I don't know.

581
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,273
Why... I don't know.

582
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:09,910
"In the event of a tie, a
winner must be chosen.

583
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:11,912
There can be only one.

584
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:16,350
And so it comes to this:

585
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:22,255
Flip... a... coin."

586
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,092
Flip a goddamn coin?

587
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:27,093
That's what we came up with?

588
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:27,760
Flip a coin.

589
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,194
That's lame as shit.

590
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:30,963
Oh, now I remember.

591
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,131
When we were writing the rules,
at one point, we just got really

592
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,065
bored, and we phoned it in.

593
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,500
That is so lame!

594
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,035
No, it's awesome.

595
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,503
Think about this, Mac.

596
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,806
They can't out-cheat us,
they can't outsmart us.

597
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:43,743
This isn't about, like, physical
endurance or anything like that.

598
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:45,812
This is just up to the
gods right now, Mac!

599
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:49,850
And there's a 50-50 chance we're
winning this whole thing, right now.

600
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:50,518
No.

601
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,486
Tails never fails.

602
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:52,887
Tails never fails!

603
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:53,922
Tails never fails.

604
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,956
Frank, we're taking tails!

605
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,358
All right, all right,
just flip the coin.

606
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,858
All right.

607
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,425
Flip that coin.

608
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,426
Flip that coin!

609
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,761
Flip that coin!

610
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,630
Flip that coin!

611
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:03,632
Flip that coin!

612
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,767
Flip that coin!

613
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:17,779
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

614
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,880
Yeah!

615
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:21,571
Ah, that felt good.

616
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,833
Losers.
