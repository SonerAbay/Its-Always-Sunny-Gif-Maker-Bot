1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:06,361
<i>Another big night, fellas... $ 164.87.</i>

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,339
<i>- That's not a lot of money.
- No, it isn't.</i>

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,605
- And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
- We paid that a week ago.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,408
A week ago was
three weeks late, Mac.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,472
Hey, guys.

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,315
I met this guy in acting class. He's really cool,
and he wants to see where I work.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,083
So could you guys
try to not be weird?

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:27,525
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,619
- We're cool!
- Not cool?

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,164
<i>- Try to be cool.
- Sometimes you're not too cool.</i>

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,427
<i>- Charlie...
- Always cool, man.</i>

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,197
- Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
- Yeah, I know.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,330
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.
- What?

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,137
Guys, this is Terrell...

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,143
from my acting class.

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,015
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, man. How's it goin'?

17
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,212
<i>- It's going good. How you doin'?
- Good, man.</i>

18
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,312
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,220
- Just closing up shop.
- Yeah.

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,986
Whoa.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,689
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers
walking through here.

22
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,697
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.

23
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,562
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.

24
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,795
Okay. Yeah, we get it.

25
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,337
You might know some of them.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
Yeah.
We're probably related.

27
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,501
No.

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,911
I don't think he was implying that you guys
are all related. That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:26,384
<i>Sweet Dee came in here a second ago
and started talking about acting class.</i>

30
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,787
- We weren't expecting you...
- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.

31
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,593
Right.

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,564
Thanks, guys.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,158
<i>When I'm promotin', everybody
and their mama gonna be there.</i>

34
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,705
There's gonna be brothers,
white boys, Latinos, whatever.

35
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,297
You got niggas
hanging from the rafters.

36
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,310
<i>So we got 400-plus packed
into this tiny little place...</i>

37
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,245
Whoa. You had 400 people
packed into a place?

38
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,282
You damn right.
That's my job, man.

39
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,318
And it's mostly college kids.

40
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,785
My sister goes to Temple,
so I got the hookup over there.

41
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,719
And hookups are good.

42
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,850
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister,
do you mean your sister or your friend...

43
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,724
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,065
<i>- I mean my sister.
- Oh. Okay. Cool.</i>

45
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,227
I was just... Because
he could mean his friend or his...

46
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,168
Stop talking.

47
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,672
So we're packed into
this little place on Walnut.

48
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,835
We're halfway through the night,
everything's goin' all right.

49
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,779
All of a sudden, I notice this dude
eyeballin' me from across the bar.

50
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,978
- Shit.
- I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.

51
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,782
<i>- He's giving you crazy eyes.
- The insane, crazy eyes.</i>

52
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,720
- Right?
- I know that.

53
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,156
So I walk over...
He's this big, cut Mexican dude...

54
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,889
<i>and I look at him and say,
"Yo, ese...</i>

55
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,455
unless you want
to get yo' ass torn apart...

56
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,058
you'd better get
that look off your face."

57
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,196
- No!
- You just walked right up to him and said that?

58
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,672
I had to, man.
You gotta make the first move.

59
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,676
- Always make the first move. You
know what I'm sayin'? - L-I know.

60
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,679
- So what happened?
- Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.

61
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,843
We're, like, eyeball to eyeball. His grill is
right up in mine. It feels like an eternity.

62
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,216
<i>Finally...</i>

63
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,654
he just opens up his mouth
and says...

64
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,956
"I guess you gon' have to
tear my ass apart, homes."

65
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,293
Oh, man. So what'd you do?

66
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,390
Took him to the back alley...

67
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,095
and I tore his ass apart!

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,967
Oh, my God!

69
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,733
That's insane!

70
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,175
Okay, I would like to do
things like that.

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,182
<i>I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?</i>

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,742
- Who does shit like that? It's like a movie.
- There's something off about him.

73
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,688
- Oh, bro, that's racist.
- No, asshole, that's not what I meant.

74
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,624
- I'll go get the coffee. What do you guys want?
- Dude, sit down. Okay?

75
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,628
Wait till the waitress comes out here,
and then you can stare at her.

76
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,790
- I wasn't gonna stare at her. I was just gonna...
- He wasn't gonna stare at her.

77
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,926
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not. I like her.

78
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,440
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed? That's a bit of a harsh word.

79
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:39,001
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.

80
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,943
- Why? For what?
- You heard him.

81
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,244
When he's promotin',
everybody named Mama's looking to get in.

82
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,183
That's true. They do have
"niggers hanging from rafters."

83
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,187
- Wow. Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.

84
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,654
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,624
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not... I'm not Adolf Hitler.

86
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,628
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.

87
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,630
Okay.

88
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,632
Well, that's just great.

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,669
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?

90
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,137
Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises,
we're looking at 200 people.

91
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,768
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.

92
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,971
All right, let's do it.

93
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,149
- Sure about this?
- It's 2005, Charlie.

94
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,655
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have
no friends outside of your own race?

95
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,658
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!

96
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,320
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not... This is a college campus.

97
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,831
This is a great place to meet people
of different cultures, diversify...

98
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,766
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,803
You're trying to make
black friends.

100
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,307
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.

101
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,468
Don't do this right now.

102
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,871
Okay. See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

103
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,884
- This is perfect.
- Huh. Yeah.

104
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,443
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.

105
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,386
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.

106
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,721
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!

107
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,726
Absolutely.

108
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,502
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...
- No.

109
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,766
<i>- No. It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.</i>

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,831
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah!

111
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,002
- Hey, what's your name?
- Oh. It's, uh, Charlie.

112
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,046
Do you play bones, Charlie?

113
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,014
I dabble.

114
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,017
Do you want to play?
I could get you a game.

115
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,020
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...

116
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:33,047
- I bet you're really good.
- Well, it's been a long time, you know.

117
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,117
- Oh, come on.
- All right. One game.

118
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,220
Domino, bitch!

119
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,869
This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.

120
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,395
- Why do these people like you more than they like me?
- Maybe it's comments like that.

121
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,274
I meant those people in there, not all black
people. What am I supposed to say?

122
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,246
You should say something different.
Figure something else out.

123
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,248
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,342
- Um, I'm Janell.
- Oh, hi.

125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,787
- Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
- Thanks.

126
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,790
You know.

127
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,383
I wanted to give you this.

128
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,395
- Oh. Okay.
- You know?

129
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,126
- Give me a call sometime. All right?
- Yeah. Sure.

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,191
Well, you...

131
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,136
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing, dude?
- What?</i>

132
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,139
That girl's gorgeous.

133
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,335
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're
not racist. She probably has friends for me.

134
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,868
Well, if anything, I think we should be
focused on black men, first of all.

135
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,006
What?

136
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,949
We don't really need...
We need black guys, so...

137
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,487
- Black guys? What are you talking about?
- You know.

138
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,888
Is this about that waitress
at the coffee shop, dude?

139
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,823
- Oh, my God!
- What?

140
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,384
- Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.

141
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,328
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why?

142
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,095
- Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
- No.

143
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,141
Give it to me.
Give it...

144
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,838
Oh, my God!
Stop making a scene!

145
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,312
<i>Just give me the wallet!
Give me the wallet!</i>

146
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,372
I can't get the goddamn...

147
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,577
<i>It's okay! It's okay, everybody!</i>

148
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,018
<i>- You're making a scene.
- You're making a scene!</i>

149
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,885
I got it.

150
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hold on a second.

151
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,091
- Ha! Ha-ha! Ha!
- Give it to me!

152
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,926
He had it!

153
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,761
Okay! You found it!

154
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,926
- I'm gonna tear it up!
- No, don't!

155
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,329
Just give me it.
I'll call the black girl. Okay?

156
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,374
Okay, buddy.

157
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,036
We're cool. We're cool.

158
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,171
We're good.
Thanks, guys. See ya.

159
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,487
I had the craziest dream last night
that I was in Cleveland, Ohio...

160
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,491
which is really weird,
because I've never even been to Ohio.

161
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,494
This guy was wearing a bunny suit,
and he was coming out...

162
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,497
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams. Okay?

163
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,501
I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.

164
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,005
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's
having sex, I just... I don't care.

165
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,939
Oh. I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.

166
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,978
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry. I am.

167
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,775
<i>- Hey! What's goin' on, guys?
- Terrell.</i>

168
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,715
- How are you?
- Hey! What's up? What's up?

169
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,447
How you doin'?
Dennis! What's goin' on?

170
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,512
- All right, man.
- How's it goin', man?

171
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,455
Good, man.

172
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,154
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside
with me for a second, man?

173
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,094
- Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah?

174
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,359
- Yeah.
- All right. Well, come on.

175
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,667
I'm gonna put these out
on the tables.

176
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,040
Rule number one:
Always keep a line.

177
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,509
Oh, my God!
That is a lot of people!

178
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,513
Wow!

179
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:51,753
- This is crazy!
- I know! I told you! Terrell's the best!

180
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,384
I'm gonna have to start
bartending full-time.

181
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,394
L-Look at this!

182
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,530
- Why are you making more money than me?
- I don't know!

183
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,627
- Hey, this is crazy!
- I know. Terrell packed 'em in. Look at this.

184
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,105
- This is crazy!
- Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.

185
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,074
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.

186
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,871
Lot of dudes.

187
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,844
What can I get you boys?

188
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,474
- Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one?

189
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,514
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett
by the jukebox?

190
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,255
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go say hey.

191
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,261
- Yo, Brettie boy!
- Hey, cuz!

192
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,527
- Hey! How you doin'?
- What's up, Brett? Can you believe this crowd?

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,398
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!

194
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,098
Gentlemen, I understand
my services have been requested.

195
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,538
I actually got a couple of services
I'd like to request.

196
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,099
Whoa! Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...

197
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:49,273
- You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm... Really?

198
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,179
<i>So blue.</i>

199
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,186
Really more of
a blue-green, actually, but...

200
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,984
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.

201
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,787
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean?

202
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,887
You guys are running
the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.

203
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,110
No! What in the hell
is your problem?

204
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,845
How could you not tell me
you were gay?

205
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,821
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.

206
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,085
I've been coming on to you
for weeks now.

207
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,787
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes!

208
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,193
- Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what?

209
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,097
The guys hired you to promote their bar,
and you turned it into a gay bar.

210
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,101
They are not happy.

211
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,107
- So much money!
- Whoo!

212
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,736
Oh! So much money!
We made more money in one night...

213
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,111
Th-Than in the entire time
that we've owned this place!

214
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,116
We have to
embrace the situation.

215
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,118
<i>We should totally
embrace the situation!</i>

216
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,051
- We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man!

217
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,112
No goddamn way.

218
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,124
Have you guys seen this?

219
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,127
"Looking for that new hot spot
to spot that stud?

220
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,629
Well, Paddy's Irish Pub
has plugged that hole."

221
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,631
- That's a nice notice.
- No, it's not nice.

222
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,724
I don't want to be
plugging anybody's holes.

223
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,201
- I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
- Of course you are.

224
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,830
I made $300 last night.
How much did you make?

225
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,103
First of all, that's rude. And that has
nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

226
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,110
It has everything to do with it.

227
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,612
I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.

228
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:33,050
If you guys remember, one of the major reasons
we got this bar was to get laid.

229
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,350
<i>Maybe you did it to get laid. I got a
little something I like to call business ethics.</i>

230
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,791
<i>Business ethics? The only reason you don't care
is you have black girls hanging all over you.</i>

231
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,959
Okay, chill out.
You're gonna screw it up.

232
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,897
Screw it up? I happen to have a date
with a nice young lady today.

233
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,595
- Ouch.
- It's a purely fiscal decision.

234
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,729
Oh, bullshit. You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.

235
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,673
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- "Everybody look at me!"

236
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,642
You know exactly
what I mean, pretty boy.

237
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,611
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.

238
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,647
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.

239
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,151
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.

240
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,949
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.

241
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,991
Okay, time out. Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.

242
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,992
<i>- Fine.
- Okay.</i>

243
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,325
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub
remaining a gay bar, say "aye."

244
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,331
- Aye.
- Aye. Opposed?

245
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,334
- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?

246
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,769
- Because you're the bartender. You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.

247
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,433
- No, she doesn't!
- Of course I get a vote!

248
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,679
All owners opposed, say "nay."

249
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,682
All people who own the bar
who are opposed, say "nay."

250
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,617
All people who own the bar
who are opposed...

251
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,654
say "nay."

252
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,290
Nay.

253
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,326
- Two against one! Oh, well.
- Ohh!

254
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,955
Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth
remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.

255
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,643
- Hey-hey! What's going on?
- Hey!

256
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,943
- Look at you! You look good!
- Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.

257
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,950
- So, where we going?
- Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.

258
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,646
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty!

259
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,882
<i>Oh, a coffee shop.</i>

260
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,551
I thought you meant,
like, a drink at a bar.

261
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,459
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.

262
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,464
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like?

263
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,659
- I don't really drink coffee. Let me see.
- Totally.

264
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,672
What do you want, Charlie?

265
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,709
"What do you want, Charlie?"

266
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,711
I'd like you to take a look at the
lovely young African-American woman...

267
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,542
sitting at the table over there.

268
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,378
Okay.

269
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,578
That woman is my friend.

270
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,678
Wow.
Good for you.

271
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,690
So, the other day when you heard me
saying something...

272
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,192
about certain people
hanging from said rafters...

273
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,127
I was quoting a friend of mine
who also happens...

274
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,132
What are you trying to say?
Spit it out.

275
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,636
Well, now that you know that I'm not racist,
you and I could maybe go on...

276
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,637
Dude, N-O.

277
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,640
- How many times do I have to say it to you?
- One time is fine.

278
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,906
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.

279
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,072
Hey, what's going on up here?

280
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,116
Oh, not too much.

281
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,552
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.
Then he asked me out on a date.

282
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,351
Charlie, is this true?

283
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,920
Would that upset you
if it was something that was true?

284
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,967
- You need to see a doctor. This thing looks really bad.
- I did!

285
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,471
- What'd he say?
- He said thatJanell punched me in my eye!

286
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,473
All right, well,
you need to keep that i...

287
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,475
- Wait. Her name's Janell?
- Yeah.

288
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,478
JanellJenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.

289
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,482
She also said if she ever saw me again,
she was going to slit my throat.

290
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,882
Are you two seeing this?

291
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,944
Boys are out tonight, huh?

292
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,524
This is unbelievable.
What is going on here?

293
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,459
You got black women
crawling all over you...

294
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,793
and this Mary here
is the belle of the ball.

295
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,924
- Why do these people like you guys so much?
- It's not that they like us.

296
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,936
It's that they don't like you.
You know why?

297
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,063
Uh, because you're an asshole!

298
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,043
Is that true?

299
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,045
Yeah, kind of.

300
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,445
Can I talk to you in back
for a second?

301
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,521
- What's up?
- You know that girlJanell? I know her.

302
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,285
- Okay. So what?
- So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.

303
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,519
Great. How?

304
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,529
We gotta start with Dennis.
Can you get him so drunk tonight? On tequila.

305
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,657
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.

306
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,702
- Yeah, sure. No problem.
- All right.

307
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,330
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.

308
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,034
But seriously...
blackout drunk.

309
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,716
All right.
Okay.

310
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,652
So you did the lime first,
and then the shot, right?

311
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,281
No. No, no, no, no.
Dude.

312
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,791
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.

313
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,794
And then you take the shot.

314
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,796
Okay.

315
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,924
- And then you suck on the lime. Okay?
- Okay.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,027
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.

317
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,971
- You lick it.
- Salt. Lick it.

318
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,031
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?

319
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,850
Oh, that's great.

320
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,387
All right, so,
I'm gonna do the shot first...

321
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,653
No, no, no, no... Oh... Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.

322
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,660
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.

323
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,662
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.

324
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,665
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...

325
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,463
<i>The salt first.
Then the lime.</i>

326
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,884
Oh, God.

327
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,493
Hello.

328
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,553
Mmm.

329
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,067
Nice.

330
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,565
Beautiful.

331
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,879
Hello, lover.

332
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,881
Whoa!

333
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,679
What the hell!
What is going on here?

334
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,084
Relax, stud. You got nothing
to be ashamed about.

335
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,123
What the f...
What does that mean?

336
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,748
<i>- Did we have...
- No. No.</i>

337
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,022
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.

338
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,825
How's that ass feelin'?

339
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,132
<i>I'm really glad
you decided to embrace this.</i>

340
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,138
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.

341
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,073
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.

342
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,167
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!

343
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:10,147
I don't want to own
a gay bar anymore.

344
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,843
What, dude?
Oh, no. What happened?

345
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,853
<i>Just, uh... I was doing
some thinking and, you know...</i>

346
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,379
We had our little experiment. It was great.
But we should go back to normal.

347
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,985
Oh. You had an experiment, and you want to
go back to the way it was before the experiment.

348
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,995
<i>- Interesting.
- The bar.</i>

349
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,726
We had our experiment with the bar,
and it was great. Let's go back to normal.

350
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,735
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?

351
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,363
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis! What's up?

352
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,373
Listen, I got you some new CDs.

353
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,036
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox
was a little bit stale.

354
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,376
Also, we gotta get rid
of these shamrocks.

355
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,382
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks
like Irish crap.

356
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,613
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah. No problem.

357
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,555
So, listen, Terrell,
it's not really working out.

358
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,149
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.

359
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:59,960
<i>No, we were happy. But then Dennis had an
experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.</i>

360
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,729
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?

361
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,702
You guys are being ridiculous.

362
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,638
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!

363
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,267
- Yes! Thank you!
- Look, everybody! Sweet Dee's here!

364
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,278
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing here?

365
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,941
- Charlie?
- What is going on here? You guys know each other?

366
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,348
Yeah! That's the crazy bitch
that punched me in my eye!

367
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,751
Charlie!
That's my sister.

368
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,687
Now, just to clarify,
when you say "sister," you mean...

369
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,159
I mean my sister.

370
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,219
<i>Yes! Okay!
This is great!</i>

371
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,926
Because earlier
you were implying that I was racist...

372
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,027
<i>because you thought that I was implying
that all black people are related.</i>

373
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,595
And then it turns out
that you people actually are!

374
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:50,204
<i>No, that's not what I meant. Hold on a second.
I meant that you two actually are.</i>

375
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,615
Mac? Stop talkin'.

376
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,620
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12,
hundred and 13...

377
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,627
$114!

378
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,629
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.

379
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,631
We are back to normal.

380
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,633
Mmm.

381
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,635
Dee, I gotta know.

382
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:15,639
What, exactly, did you tell those guys
from your acting class to do to Dennis?

383
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,801
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.

384
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,142
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.

385
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,247
Then why was he so freaked out?

386
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,479
How's that ass feelin'?
