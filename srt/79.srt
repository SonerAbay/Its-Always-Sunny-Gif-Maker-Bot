1
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:13,199
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

2
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,971
This is such a stupid
goddamn situation.

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,538
We got to get
out of here, Dennis.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,540
We've got to get out of here.

5
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:18,208
We need a plan.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,210
Okay, well, plan one is for you
to lower your goddamn voice.

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:24,452
This is as low as I go, okay?

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:27,188
I say we bum-rush her and choke
her out with her own belt.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,689
Dee, yore escalating shit.

10
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:30,327
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,365
We immediately escalate
everything to a ten.

12
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,299
It's ridiculous.

13
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,638
I mean, somebody comes in with
some preposterous plan or idea.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,609
And then all of a sudden,
everybody's on the gas.

15
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:40,443
Nobody's on the brakes.

16
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:41,144
Nobody's thinking.

17
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:43,748
Everybody's just talking over each other
with one idiotic idea after another.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,017
Until, finally, we find
ourselves in a situation where

19
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,452
we've broken into somebody's house.

20
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:48,787
And the homeowner is home.

21
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:49,755
Yes, yes.

22
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:50,489
I'm sick of it, Dee.

23
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,156
Okay.

24
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:51,890
We can't do this anymore.

25
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:52,558
Okay.

26
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,328
We've got to examine our process.

27
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,995
Fine.

28
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,330
I'm on board with that, okay?

29
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:57,932
But right now I'm trying
to come up with solutions.

30
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,069
So if you don't want to choke
her out, we wot choke her out.

31
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:01,804
But you need to help me come
up with a plan, p okay?

32
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,141
Because this is breaking and entering.

33
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,309
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,344
Dee, your breath is hideous.

35
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:07,412
I mean, it smells bad.

36
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:08,146
Okay.

37
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,082
Okay.

38
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,049
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,555
We are really in over
our heads this time.

40

41
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:42,738
I'm saying, this was a
totally avoidable situation.

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,406
I know.

43
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:45,175
I know I'm not innocent
in all this, okay?

44
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:47,377
I know I shouldn't have stood
on that table and given that

45
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,479
awesome speech about how I was
the perfect one to lead us into

46
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:50,881
the house because of
my wonderful grace.

47
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:51,581
I know that.

48
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,482
I regret that now.

49
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:53,950
It was a very persuasive speech.

50
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,153
Oh, she's packing a suitcase.

51
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:59,855
I definitely regret you getting
quadruple onions on your burger.

52
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:01,891
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I
was going to be trapped in a

53
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,426
closet with you for the afternoon.

54
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:06,095
I definitely regret being dragged
along into this whole thing.

55
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:08,230
For what purpose would
you have been dragged?

56
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,999
You nosed your way into this
like you do everything.

57
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,934
You are nothing but liabilities, Dee.

58
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:13,668
Oh, come on.

59
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,570
Loud voice, breath reeks.

60
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:18,172
Nosey.

61
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,140
Oh, she's leaving.

62
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:19,807
She's leaving.

63
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,409
She's gone.

64
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,710
Okay, okay, okay.

65
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:23,711
I'm gonna call Mac and Charlie.

66
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:24,845
Okay.

67
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:25,513
Guys, come in.

68
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,280
Are you there?

69
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:27,315
Yes, extraction team.

70
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:28,416
What is your status?

71
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:30,418
Have you recovered the artifact yet?

72
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,285
No.

73
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:32,787
We are off the artifact plan.

74
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,323
We are not doing the
artifact plan anymore.

75
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,958
It is a stupid plan.

76
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,159
Negative, negative.

77
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,928
It is an awesome plan, okay?

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,963
This family should not
have the artifact.

79
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:44,565
It belongs in a museum.

80
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:45,866
Belongs in a museum, bro.

81
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:49,570
Adults should not be making plans
that are based on dumb movies!

82
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:50,704
Excuse me?

83
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:54,074
<i>Indiana Jones</i> is a dumb movie?

84
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,109
I-I like the first one.

85
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:55,776
Oh, God.

86
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:56,844
I-I like him as a character.

87
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:57,578
Oh, God. Come on.

88
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,780
But some of the mov-- Okay, listen...
It's not about that.

89
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:02,282
I'm just saying that the plan
was genuinely dumb, as many of

90
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,817
our plans are, I now realize.

91
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,420
What about your whole speech
about "I have the grace of a

92
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:09,023
falcon, and I'll be in and
out like a demon's whisper"?

93
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,659
Dude, you stood up on your chair
in that burger restaurant

94
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,961
and said that speech for everybody!

95
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,229
It was a damn good speech.

96
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:16,130
It was very persuasive.

97
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,933
But I regret it now.
I got to pee.

98
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,502
No.

99
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,805
Dee, Dee, what-what are you doing?

100
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,306
She could come back in
here at any moment.

101
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,509
Well, what...
<i>Indiana Jones: Part 4</i> was dumb.

102
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,377
I'll give you that, yeah.

103
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,244
I wouldn't even count it.

104
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,146
I'm gonna say <i>Temple of</i>
<i>Doom's</i> out for me, as well.

105
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:30,847
Is it out for you?

106
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,515
That's also dumb.

107
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:32,182
I liked that one.

108
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:35,185
Uh... Um, guys, can we
talk about this later?

109
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,120
Frank, let's go.

110
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,155
We're bailing.

111
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:41,025
I ain't going nowhere
until I get that vase.

112
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:42,126
Forget about the vase, Frank.

113
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,260
We're bailing on the vase, okay?

114
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,128
Frank's right actually, okay?

115
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,329
We got to thing about the vase.

116
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,164
We got to think about
what's best for the vase.

117
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,534
Yes, we are men of honor who protect
artifacts from those who steal them.

118
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,202
What?

119
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,038
You didn't give a shit about
artifacts two hours ago.o.

120
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,106
So what? Now we do.

121
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,708
Yeah, what's that have
to do with anything?

122
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,910
Well, we should not be
committing crimes based on

123
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,111
beliefs that are two hours old.

124
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:02,614
Well, then don't read us
newspaper articles about stolen

125
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,316
artifacts that outrage us.

126
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,286
That article was about how the
museum is holding an auction

127
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,488
to raise money, okay?

128
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,589
Nothing was stolen.

129
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,657
The vase is not stolen.

130
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,625
Yeah, as a matter of fact, only
if we follow through with

131
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,027
this plan will the vase be stolen.

132
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:16,629
Well, you were the ones who escalated
us off of being the extraction team.

133
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,198
We could have gotten
in and out of there.

134
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,733
Well, escalate your way back
in, for all I give a shit.

135
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:21,735
I'm leaving. I quit.

136
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:22,636
Me, too.

137
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,637
Well, I'm still in.

138
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,871
Living on the edge.

139
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:25,972
It's making me feel alive.

140
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,640
Shh!

141
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,307
Yes!

142
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,443
See, now, Frank, that is why you
are on the extraction team.

143
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,779
Frank's got the attitude, Dennis
has the grace... Dee nosed in.

144
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:33,680
She nosed in.

145
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:36,650
Dee was dragged.

146
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,684
Oh, shit.

147
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:41,722
Extraction team, there is an SUV
pulling up in front of the house.

148
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:42,857
There is a man getting out.

149
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,559
Okay, I cannot see the driver's
face, but the subject

150
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:49,363
appears to have pointed
feet of some kind.

151
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,765
Okay, I'm repeating here.

152
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,001
He has pointed feet, so careful now.

153
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:53,702
What does that mean?

154
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:54,569
What does that mean?

155
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,505
He's wearing cowboy boots.

156
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,275
Okay, yes, I'm seeing now that
they are cowboy-- you know,

157
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:01,910
his feet could be pointed on the inside, so let's be...
They're definitely not

158
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:02,544
pointed on the inside.

159
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:03,345
How do you know that?

160
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,113
How do you know that?

161
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,582
They're definitely not-- I mean,
I guess I can't say for sure.

162
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,616
You don't know that for sure.

163
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,283
Sweetheart?

164
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,017
You home?

165
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:09,685
Up here, darling!

166
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:10,352
What?

167
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:11,320
Is she coming back up here?

168
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,387
Why is she coming back up here?

169
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,321
Oh, shit, back in the closet.

170
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,389
Yippee-i-ki-yay.

171
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,592
All right.

172
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:20,761
What the hell?

173
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,767
Oh, I just saw her put the
vase in the suitcase.

174
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,434
What?

175
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:28,101
No.

176
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:30,437
We can barely even tell if
that's a person and a suitcase.

177
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,138
I have to pee so bad.

178
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,273
Deandra, your breath is dog shit.

179
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,441
I know.

180
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,575
What are you doing home?

181
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,410
Well, I got a call from
the alarm coarmpany.

182
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:39,545
They said it was the house.

183
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,279
This is bad.

184
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,014
Oh, I must have set if off.

185
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,116
I just popped by to grab a jacket.

186
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,617
I told you you'd be chilly.

187
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,286
Yeah, you're always right
about that, honey.

188
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:49,721
Well, I got an appointment, you know.

189
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:50,389
Oh, yeah.

190
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,791
I-I'm heading back to the office.

191
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:52,458
Bye, sugar.

192
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,125
Bye.

193
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,260
What the hell was that?

194
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,062
Very strange.

195
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:56,930
That was close.

196
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:57,697
Give me a chip.

197
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,364
No, no.

198
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,299
These are my chips.

199
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,300
You don't get a chip.

200
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:01,635
What's going on in there?

201
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:04,704
Basically, these people are Southern,
and the lady lied to the man.

202
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,108
Are they gone?

203
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,909
I don't know.

204
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,210
Let's just quietly get out.

205
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,478
It's phase time, bitches.

206
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,279
What? What?

207
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:13,046
No, no, no, no.

208
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,047
What are you doing, Frank?

209
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:16,149
We are in a very dangerous
situation here.

210
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,884
These people are from the South.

211
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:18,585
That's weird.

212
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,353
People from the South don't
usually move up North.

213
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:21,487
Oh, no, they come up.

214
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:24,024
These carpetbaggers come up by the
truckloads just to steal our artifacts.

215
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:24,691
Carpetbaggers, huh?

216
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:25,358
Yeah.

217
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,126
Give me a chip.

218
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:27,560
No, you don't get chips, Charlie!

219
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,230
I mean, God only knows what these
people will do to us if they catch us.

220
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,933
These Southerners, they probably pray
for a home invasion every single day.

221
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,135
They can't wait to get their
hands on home invaders, so they

222
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:38,839
can blast them with shotguns and-and,
uh, do God knows what to them, Frank.

223
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,209
We'll be lucky if the only thing
that happens is we go to jail.

224
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,043
We have got to go.

225
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,946
Hey, if some hillbilly comes up
to me, I'm gonna lash him in

226
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:45,947
the face, that's all.

227
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:46,848
No, Frank.

228
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,684
They are always armed to the teeth.

229
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,887
They will hogtie us and hang us out on
the front lawn or burn us on a cross.

230
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,688
You're right, man.

231
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,556
You got to be careful.

232
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:55,691
You know, anytime you find out,
like, some dude's got a crazy

233
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,861
torture basement or something,
it's someone from the South.

234
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:58,528
It always is.

235
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,531
You know what, extraction team,
why don't you go down to

236
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,733
the basement and see if it's
some kind of crazy type dungeon.

237
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:03,467
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,103
Dungeons and tons of guns and--
dude, please give me a chip.

239
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,604
You're not getting shit, okay?!

240
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:08,272
Come on!

241
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:09,639
Leave it alone with the chips.

242
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,342
If you wanted chips, you could've
gotten a bag at the hamburger store.

243
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,343
Don't ask me again!

244
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,278
I can't listen to this shit anymore.

245
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,279
Ooh!

246
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,280
Hmm. Q-tip holder.

247
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,281
Shit.

248
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:19,282
Oh, problem solved.

249
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:20,283
Can we just get out of here?

250
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,284
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

251
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:22,352
Hold on, hold on.

252
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,353
I think you need to see this.

253
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,354
Dee, you are nosing in.

254
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,355
Nip it in the bud.

255
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,357
A whole bunch of tickets to
<i>The Jay Leno Show.</i>

256
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,358
<i>Who cares?</i>

257
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,359
<i>No. Listen to me.</i>

258
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,360
<i>Who wants to see Jay Leno 15, 16 times?</i>

259
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:32,361
<i>No one.</i>

260
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:33,362
<i>No one wants to see him once.</i>

261
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,363
<i>At all, right?</i>

262
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:35,364
<i>I got a theory.</i>

263
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,816
<i>She's banging Leno.</i>

264
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,839
<i>She's having an affair with Leno.</i>

265
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,207
<i>Frank, if she was banging Jay
Leno, why would she have to buy</i>

266
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,142
<i>a bunch of tickets to his show?</i>

267
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,143
<i>That's stupid, Frank.</i>

268
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,144
<i>Use your head.</i>

269
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:45,145
<i>I've got an idea, though.</i>

270
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,446
<i>She's trying to kill him.</i>

271
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:48,281
<i>She's still very upset about
the whole Conan thing.</i>

272
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:49,282
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

273
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,183
<i>That's it-- she's icing Leno.</i>

274
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,952
<i>She's packing her suitcase.</i>

275
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,787
<i>She's sneaking away from her husband.</i>

276
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:54,788
<i>Listen to me.</i>

277
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,623
<i>Those are the theories of lunatics.</i>

278
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,625
<i>Okay.</i>

279
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,459
<i>We have got to get to
get out of here now.</i>

280
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,460
<i>Yes, he's right. Let's go.</i>

281
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:01,328
<i>No. Back off, bitch.</i>

282
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,822
<i>I ain't leaving until I get that vase.</i>

283
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:06,300
<i>Stop it! Stop it.</i>

284
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,301
<i>He's gonna hurt himself.</i>

285
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,303
<i>Never should have let
him have that whip.</i>

286
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,114
<i>For God sake, let's
just get out of here.</i>

287
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:11,098
<i>Let's go, come on.</i>

288
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,850
Okay, I think
the back door's this way.

289
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:31,428
Dee, you gangly, uncoordinated bitch, I am
not getting hogtied over your lack of grace.

290
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,048
I hope they hogtie you.

291
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,826
And then I hope the rape you in
their basement for ten years.

292
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,495
Dee, listen to me.

293
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,497
Go!

294
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,467
I'm telling you, I have a
weird feeling about this.

295
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,671
He just randomly comes home with
some story about the alarm.

296
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,106
He knows something.

297
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,740
Look, we should just do it now.

298
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:50,741
Pull the trigger.

299
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:51,742
Pull the trigger?

300
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:52,743
What does that mean?

301
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:53,744
Who is she talking to?

302
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,746
What is she talking about
pulling the trigger on?

303
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:56,747
I don't know.

304
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,648
I mean, until now, I was
thinking this Southern violence

305
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,417
talk was just, you know, bull shit.

306
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,251
It was just an escalation of some kind.

307
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:03,252
Mm-hmm.

308
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:04,920
But now I think it might not
be, you know what I mean?

309
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:05,921
Uh-huh.

310
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:07,789
I mean, who is she
talking to right now?

311
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,790
Who is that person?

312
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,426
They're gonna pull the trigger on somebody?
Jesus Christ.

313
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,161
I mean, I'm only asking because I
think knowing this might help

314
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:12,928
us get out of this mess.

315
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,929
You know what I'm saying?

316
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:14,931
Mm. Mm-hmm.

317
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,766
What is going on with you, Dee?

318
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,601
You should be nosing into
this like crazy right now.

319
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:19,436
I can't hold it anymore.

320
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:20,437
What?

321
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,106
The toilet's right behind you, so I'm
just gonna go ahead and pee in it.

322
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,107
Oh, no, no.

323
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,777
You are just gonna intentionally
spray DNA all over the crime crime.

324
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,612
I'm not gonna spray anything anywhere.

325
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,447
Are you not familiar with
how a woman urinates?

326
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:32,116
Yes, I am, Dee, but you
cannot flush the toilet.

327
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,951
It's going to make too much noise.

328
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:35,619
Then you're just gonna have
a bowl full of evidence.

329
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,354
Okay, well, you've got a really
good point, but I'm going

330
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,988
to do it anyway, okay, so it's
it's happening, it's happening.

331
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,890
You can't do it, you can't do it, no.

332
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:41,724
It's happening. Watch me.

333
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,458
Oh, my God. You are all liabilities.

334
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,160
Why did you nose your way into this?
I hate you.

335
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,895
Okaym , I'm gonna go find Mac
ad Charlie so they create a

336
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,663
diversion so we can get
the hell out of here.

337
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:49,497
Don't pee with me in the room!

338
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,332
Right now, yeah, go ahead and go.

339
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,333
Oh, thank you, God.

340
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,204
Mac? Charlie? Come in.

341
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:57,784
Mac? Charlie?

342
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:00,841
I'm telling you, Charlie, the
situation is out of control.

343
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,525
Let's just get out of
here while we still can.

344
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:03,849
Without the guys?

345
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:04,984
Oh, they're as good as dead.

346
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,652
There's no telling what those
Southern people are gonna do to them.

347
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:08,653
You're right, man.

348
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:09,654
You know what?

349
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,657
We should just get the hell out of
here, and I mean out of Philadelphia.

350
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,693
I mean, we should just drive and
drive and drive and not look back.

351
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:17,795
We should go to Arizona and open
up that imported leather shop

352
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:18,729
that we've always talked about.

353
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:20,798
Oh, my God, the leathers, yes--
the tasseled leathers, the

354
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,732
turquoise studs on the leathers.

355
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:22,733
All the leather.

356
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:23,734
Yeah.

357
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,569
Okay, okay, do you
have the keys on you?

358
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:26,403
Yeah, let's get the keys.

359
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:27,404
Let't s get the keys.

360
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:28,405
Let's get out of here.

361
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I heard all that.

362
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,075
Were you holding down the button?

363
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:33,076
It was an accident.

364
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,079
I wasn't...
It was just sort of a reflex.

365
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,815
You're always holding that thing down, and...
What? I'm...

366
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:38,583
Uh, sorry, extraction team.

367
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,418
We were having a leather conversation.

368
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,255
We're-We're... Doesn't really...
Hey, um, what's the status on the vase?

369
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,256
Do not take off on us!

370
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,425
I repeat, do not take off on us.

371
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,128
Leather shop in Arizona?

372
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,196
Are you serious?

373
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,431
There are far too many leather
shops in Arizona as it is.

374
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,166
You would be out of
business in a week's time.

375
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,235
What did you expect us to do, okay?

376
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,137
You got us all freaked out in
here, sitting here waiting for

377
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,272
the Southerners to tie us up to
horses and then have them run in

378
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,941
opposite directions, ripping us apart.

379
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:03,941
Yeah.

380
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,211
How are we not supposed to fantasize about
opening up imported leather shops in

381
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,212
Arizona?

382
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:07,979
Yeah, give me a chip.

383
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,747
No, you're not getting the chips.

384
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,683
The chips are off the table, okay?

385
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:12,350
I want a chip!

386
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,117
Don't bring up the chips.

387
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:13,784
Give me a chip.

388
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,320
He wants chips, and I asked him in
the store, Dennis, you were there.

389
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:18,055
I said, "Charlie, do you
want a bag of chips?"

390
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:19,990
He said, "No, I don't want chips."

391
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:21,759
If you wanted the goddamn chami,
you should have gotten the

392
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,761
goddamn chips at the hamburger shop!

393
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,630
Stop, calm down, calm down, listen.

394
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:28,499
We need the two of you to create a
diversion so that we can sneak

395
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,600
out of the house.

396
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,337
She just flushed the toilet.

397
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,139
Yeah, fine, it's just--
fine, I'm just hungry.

398
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,140
We'll do a diversion.

399
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,909
Oh, shit, I just thought of something.

400
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:39,910
What?

401
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,879
What if this vase is cursed, okay?

402
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,681
Maybe that's why things
aren't going well, right?

403
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:46,017
If this vase has a curse on it,
you do not want to touch it.

404
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,885
I repeat, do not touch
this vase if you see it.

405
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,954
Pick it up with, like, you know what?

406
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:53,457
Get a bag of sand of some sort and...
Get, get Dee to touch it.

407
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,458
Is Dee there?

408
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,994
If you find Dee...
Are you still talking about the vase?

409
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:57,795
The vase is not cursed.

410
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:58,762
It's from the 1800s.

411
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,030
It was a time of science.

412
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,799
Jesus, Dee, why did
you flush the toilet?

413
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,502
Well, you had me all freaked out
about spray and DNA evidence.

414
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,437
W-What's going on with Mac and Charlie?

415
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,038
It's-- I can't get
them to stay focused.

416
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,907
They keep escalating the
conversation into evil curses

417
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,810
and opening leather shops in Arizona.

418
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:13,578
A leather shop in Arizona?

419
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,579
Yeah.

420
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:16,848
Well, they'd be out of
business in a week's time.

421
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,150
That's exactly what I said.

422
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,618
We need to split 'em up.

423
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,619
That's a good idea.

424
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,555
How do you propose we do that?

425
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:24,891
Hey, Charlie, hey, it's Dee.

426
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,827
Listen, uh, how come Mac's the
only one who gets to push the

427
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,065
button on the walkie?

428
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:37,504
Uh, let me get back to you on that.

429
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,047
Where are you guys?

430
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,515
I'm in a little girl's room.

431
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:50,516
Frank, get back here.

432
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,585
Mac and Charlie are
gonna do a diversion.

433
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:53,419
No way.

434
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:55,421
The little bitch has got a suitcase.

435
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,990
I'll bet the vase is in it.

436
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,125
No, no, I doubt that.

437
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,161
Yeah, yeah, at this point, I
doubt that ts is even the

438
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,962
family mentioned in the article.

439
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:06,968
Frilly little dress, pink nightie.

440
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,336
Holy hell.

441
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:11,906
There's a teddy bear and it's
got something hard in it.

442
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:16,811
I'll bet the wife put the vase in the
teddy bear to steal it from the husband.

443
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,947
No, no, that is absolute insanity.

444
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:19,714
I'm gonna gut this thing.

445
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,782
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

446
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,750
No, no, n-n-no, Frank.

447
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,520
Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.

448
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:28,856
Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.

449
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,091
Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.

450
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:30,758
Shut up.

451
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,692
Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.

452
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,027
Shut, shut up.

453
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,028
That is outrageous.

454
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,197
That is an outrageous amount of noise.

455
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,132
Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.

456
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,333
That's loud.

457
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,302
Okay, oh, I'll smother it.

458
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,303
Frank, Frank, do not.

459
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:42,838
Fra, stop it.

460
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,074
Hi, I'm
Albert, I love you.

461
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,243
Hi, I'm Albert... Are you kidding me?

462
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:51,148
Goddamn it.

463
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,085
How have we not been
caught at this point?

464
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:58,355
Hey, what's up, guys?

465
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,490
Charlie, what are you doing here?

466
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:01,157
I snuck in.

467
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,758
Mac was, like, being a dick
about the walkie-talkie.

468
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,629
You know how, like, he wouldn't
let me push the button and stuff?

469
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,664
Dick.

470
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,666
So he can just sneak in, but
we can't seem to sneak out?

471
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:12,169
It wasn't easy-- there's, like,
a ton of clots in this house.

472
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,171
I didn't know which
closet you were in, okay?

473
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,172
I had to look in a lot.

474
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:16,907
All right, well, now that we've
split you two idiots up,

475
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,842
maybe we can finally get
Mac to do a diversion.

476
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,844
Hi, Mama, I'm home.

477
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:24,181
Jesus Christ, now there's
a kid in the house?

478
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:27,484
Mac, dude, a kid just walked into
the house-- a little heads up!

479
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,152
Could you hold on one second, Dennis?

480
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:32,589
Okay, so that's a double-double
cheeseburger meal with a extra-large

481
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,891
chocolate shake?

482
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:37,728
Um, can you go ahead and throw an extra
double cheeseburger on there, please?

483
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,130
'Cause I'm very hungry.

484
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:42,033
Mac, now is not the time to
run off and get a hamburger!

485
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,067
We need your help!

486
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,503
I didn't just run off, dude.

487
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,170
I'm coming back.

488
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,171
We need you to come back now.

489
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,173
We need you to create a diversion.

490
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:49,808
We have got to get out of this house!

491
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,810
What happened to Charlie's diversion?

492
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,812
Charlie doesn't know what a
diversion is, apparently.

493
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,214
He just ran directly into the house.

494
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,716
Fine. I'll be right back.

495
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:59,051
Okay, great, thank you.

496
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,052
Hey, get chips this time.

497
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,053
I'm not gonna get chips!

498
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,722
He got mad at me for not... Shut up.

499
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:03,723
Well, you know what?

500
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:04,723
I'll be a plumber.

501
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,059
I'll knock on the front door,
tell 'em I got a deal on pipes,

502
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,861
you guys run out the back.

503
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:11,163
That's a little elaborate, but okay.

504
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,166
Ooh, I'll do a Swedish accent!

505
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,203
No, you do not do a Swedish accent--
you don't know how to do one.

506
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,204
And you don't need to, dude.

507
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,207
These people don't know who you are!

508
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,076
I can't just tell them that we're there
to steal their artifact, Dennis.

509
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,414
There is a huge amount of middle
ground between those two things.

510
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,417
I'm a Swedish
plumber-- I'm here to fix your pipes.

511
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,417
That's good.

512
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,418
That's a good accent.

513
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,421
Do a Philadelphia accent if you
insist on doing an accent.

514
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,423
I'm not going to do a
Philadelphia accent.

515
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,925
I'm gonna do a Swedish accent,
because that's what Indy would do.

516
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,427
Are you still
there, Dennis, are you still there?

517
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,396
Don't worry about it, and
don't worry about anything.

518
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:43,731
I'm gonna kill you.

519
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,867
I'm gonna <i>kill you!</i>

520
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,069
<i>Well, guys, looks like
we're on our own.</i>

521
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,203
<i>Let's just make our move.</i>

522
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,205
<i>Charlie, how'd you sneak in here?</i>

523
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:53,373
<i>Front door.</i>

524
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,576
<i>Let's just... Front door?</i>

525
00:15:55,578 --> 00:16:00,081
<i>You just walked right
in the front door?</i>

526
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,084
<i>Well, I ran, I had a little hustle
going, but yeah, front door.</i>

527
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,054
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

528
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:07,957
<i>I'm beginning to think we
should just walk right out</i>

529
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,192
<i>the front door, then.</i>

530
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:12,295
<i>I'm beginning to think that this
family has zero awareness</i>

531
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:13,362
<i>of their surroundings.</i>

532
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,697
<i>Let's go. Let's just go.</i>

533
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:15,932
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

534
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,668
<i>So,
tell me, Madison, do you like</i>

535
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,602
<i>Disneyland?</i>

536
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,337
<i>Yeah.</i>

537
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,575
<i>Well, we are going there right now.
Surprise!</i>

538
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:26,976
<i>I already packed your suitcase.</i>

539
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,478
<i>Did you pack Binky?</i>

540
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,746
<i>Well, no, I packed Elbert.</i>

541
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,381
<i>I don't want Elbert.</i>

542
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:32,749
<i>I want Binky!</i>

543
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,151
<i>Go grab your Binky and hurry
up, 'cause we got to go!</i>

544
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,419
<i>Frank, Frank!</i>

545
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:38,421
<i>Frank! Little girl coming your way.</i>

546
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,751
<i>I'm gonna whip this little
bitch in the face if she makes a a peep.</i>

547
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:48,736
<i>Binky?</i>

548
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:49,890
<i>Binky?</i>

549
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,467
<i>Binky!</i>

550
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,246
We are assholes.

551
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,292
No one is planning to murder
Jay Leno or anyone else.

552
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:06,094
This is a nice woman planning a
surprise California vacation.

553
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:07,595
Dangerous family? No.

554
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,752
Barry! What took you so long?

555
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,872
Mom, how come Barry's here?

556
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:20,976
Oh, well, uh, he's coming with us
to Disneyland instead of Daddy.

557
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:23,546
How'd
you like it if we could go to

558
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,480
Disneyland every day?

559
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,783
Are we going to California?

560
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:27,484
Without Daddy?

561
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:28,852
Well, I'll be your new daddy.

562
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:31,155
Uh-oh.

563
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:32,823
Oh, my God, did you hear that?

564
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:35,459
She's out there, and they're
all going to Disneyland.

565
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,997
Barry, I
followed you, you son of a bitch.

566
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,899
I knew something was up.

567
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:44,701
You're my best friend!

568
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,136
How could you do this to me?

569
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,138
Do you still love me?

570
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,139
I don't know anymore.

571
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,141
It's not good when the
kids get involved.

572
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:52,142
Very sad.

573
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,144
...or so help me God, I will
beat the hell out of you.

574
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:55,646
Let's just make a break for it.

575
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:01,084
Everybody shut up!

576
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:05,823
Now, let's all just calm down, and we'll
talk this thing out like a family.

577
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:08,859
I don't care if it takes all night.

578
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,529
Oh, God, no. All night?

579
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:13,830
I can't do all night, you guys.

580
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:15,698
I don't have it in me.

581
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,099
Screw it.

582
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,868
Let's just walk right out.

583
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,869
They're not gonna notice;

584
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:21,871
they got a lot on their...
Their marriage is falling apart.

585
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:22,572
Let's walk right out.

586
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:24,575
I'm just gonna walk right out.

587
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,911
Let's do it.

588
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:32,251
I've tried to make this work, but
if you want to go, you can go.

589
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:35,522
But you're not taking my little girl.

590
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:42,062
Hello.

591
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:42,729
Hey.

592
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:50,671
Hello! I am the Swedish plumber...
Uh, Mac... Hey, Frank, we're out here!

593
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:53,540
Yo!

594
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,277
Oh.

595
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,978
The vase!

596
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,184
Shit!

597
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:06,120
All right, we'll just, uh...
Yeah, why don't we head out.

598
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:11,025
Should've sideways...
We should just... Thank you.

599
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,340
It was weird that they
were Asian, right?

600
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,637
