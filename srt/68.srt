1
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:03,942
Frank, I'd like to
thank you for giving me the

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:04,943
opportunity of a lifetime.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,944
Whatever.

4
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:07,612
I hope they have some cool,
exotic creatures for us to

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,447
fiddle around with and play with.

6
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:11,282
Dennis, we're going
to an animal rights event.

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,118
There's gonna be all sorts
of exotic creatures there.

8
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:14,119
You think so?

9
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,120
SWEET DEE: Oh.

10
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,988
They better have some
cool stuff at this thing.

11
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:19,791
I mean, the money I laid out for this
charity... they could have built a zoo.

12
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,793
Yeah. Actually, guys,
zoos are animal prisons.

13
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:23,795
See, I've been boning up on my
animal rights literature so I

14
00:00:23,863 --> 00:00:25,797
can have some talking
points with Chase.

15
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:27,799
He's a big animal rights lover,
and he's gonna be there.

16
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:30,802
Security is not gonna let you go
anywhere near Chase Utley, bro.

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,204
Those creepy letters
you've been writing him?

18
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:35,607
You've got to be on a list somewhere.

19
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,842
What are you giving me shit for, okay?

20
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,843
Oh!

21
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,712
Dee's the one going after
Ryan Howard all of a sudden.

22
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,713
Well, so what?

23
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:42,714
Why is that weird?

24
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:43,715
That makes perfect sense.

25
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:44,716
I'm a hot, single lady.

26
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:45,717
He's a hot, single man.

27
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:47,719
Hot? Dee,
you're pregnant as shit.

28
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:48,720
Frank, this shortcut sucks.

29
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:49,721
It ain't a shortcut.

30
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,723
Why in the hell are we in the woods?

31
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,724
Get on the A.C. Expressway.

32
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:53,725
Goes straight to Atlantic City.

33
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:54,726
I'm avoiding tolls.

34
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:55,727
Okay, hold on a second.

35
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:57,729
You're willing to shell out tons
of money for a charity, and you

36
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,731
can't spare a couple
bucks for a toll road?

37
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,734
What? What do you want me to do, give
all my money to some toll jockey?

38
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:03,735
Yeah.

39
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:04,736
Just for riding on a street?

40
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,738
Squirrel!

41
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:18,060
 

42
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,443
Oh, thank God.

43
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,478
That was close.

44
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:44,412
Why did you do that, Mac?

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,413
Goddamn it!

46
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,415
You almost ran over
that squirrel, Frank.

47
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,142
So you should have
let me mash it.

48
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:52,037
*

49
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:55,476
*

50
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,659
I can't wait to make my speech.

51
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:59,661
I'm gonna get up there and lace
into these liberal nut jobs.

52
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,997
What? I thought you
loved animals now.

53
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:06,835
No. I only donated all this money so I
could make a mockery of their cause.

54
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:09,738
Animals should be food,
rugs and trophies.

55
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:12,107
Why do you think I'm
wearing a leather suit?

56
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,275
Are you? Is that leather?

57
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,276
Bet your ass it's leather.

58
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,278
Huh.
I just assumed it was plastic.

59
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,093
Who wears a plastic suit?

60
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,124
I don't know, Frank.

61
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:20,516
*

62
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:22,587
All right, listen, I'm gonna call us
a tow truck and get us out of here.

63
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,252
I'm not getting any bars, though.

64
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,253
You getting any bars, Frank?

65
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,254
I got nothing. What gives?

66
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:28,256
What gives is that we're in the
middle of goddamn nowhere.

67
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:31,259
What happened?

68
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,260
Are we in A.C.?

69
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:34,262
No, we're not in A.C.
because Mac wrecked the car, and now

70
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,263
we're stranded somewhere.

71
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:36,264
Oh, man!

72
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:37,265
Oh.

73
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,267
"Come to Atlantic City," you said.

74
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:42,270
"Let us tie you up and put a sack on
your head so you don't freak out.

75
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:43,104
That'll be a good adventure,"

76
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,105
you said.

77
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,107
Well, I'm freaking out a little bit.

78
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:46,941
Right. Relax. Relax, Charlie.

79
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,943
This is gonna be a great
adventure, this is exciting.

80
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:49,944
This is the unknown.

81
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:50,945
This is all part of it, man.

82
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,947
Well, it ain't a great
adventure to me.

83
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,883
Riding on a private jet, sipping
champagne... that's an adventure.

84
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,885
Then why didn't you fly us
in a private jet to A.C.?

85
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:57,986
It's only 80 miles.

86
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,522
You know how quick that trip would be?

87
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:01,790
Be a total waste of money.

88
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:03,792
See, this is why I don't
leave Philly, all right?

89
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,794
You leave Philly, and
bad shit happens.

90
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:06,895
I mean trees? Everywhere trees?

91
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:07,896
What the hell is this place?

92
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,898
All right, I'm hitching
a ride back home.

93
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:10,999
Calm down, Charlie.

94
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,535
Let's all walk, and we'll
find some help, okay?

95
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,537
I'm not walking, 'cause I got a
baby on board, my feet hurt.

96
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,872
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
'cause this suit is, like,

97
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,873
chafing me up like crazy.

98
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,874
Oh, Jesus. All right.

99
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,644
Mac and I and Charlie will go
find some help, okay? Okay?

100
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:24,646
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
except I'm not gonna go.

101
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,648
I'm gonna hang back
and oil up my glove.

102
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:27,649
Your glove?

103
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:28,650
What is your endgame in this?

104
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,652
I'm gonna have a catch
with Chase Utley.

105
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,655
You... We got... Chase Utley is
not gonna have a catch with you.

106
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:34,656
Come on, come on.

107
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:35,657
Don't you say that, Charlie!

108
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:36,658
Don't you say that!

109
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:37,659
Listen, listen.

110
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:38,660
We're gonna find help, okay?

111
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:39,728
Hurry up, guys.

112
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:42,217
Hurry up, 'cause I
got to get to Chase.

113
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,905
*

114
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:51,575
*

115
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,214
*

116
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:56,042
*

117
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:59,207
*

118
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:02,240
*

119
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,803
*

120
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,678
*

121
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:07,981
*

122
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,689
*

123
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,862
Well, listen.

124
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:14,429
Sometimes, even I can't control everything,
so when a new experience presents

125
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:18,433
itself to me, I try to stay
open to it and just say yes.

126
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,434
Say yes, huh?

127
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:21,436
Yeah.
Hey, let me show you something.

128
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:22,437
Let me show you something.

129
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,438
Look.

130
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:24,439
Huh. You wearing makeup?

131
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,641
Yeah, I'm always wearing a
little bit of foundation, but

132
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,642
that's not the point, Charlie.

133
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,643
What do you see there?

134
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:29,644
Oh, shit!

135
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,645
You got a lesion, dude.

136
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,647
No, it's not...
That's not a lesion.

137
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:33,648
It's a hickey.

138
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:34,649
Oh.

139
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:35,650
You never seen a hickey?

140
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:36,651
No, I have. Ew! Weird!

141
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,554
I thought women our age
didn't give hickeys anymore.

142
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:40,555
Oh, no, they don't.

143
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,657
Young ladies do, though, and I
met an extremely young lady the

144
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,658
other day, and she gave me this.

145
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:44,659
Weird.

146
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:45,660
No, she was legal.

147
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:46,661
She was totally legal.

148
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,695
I always check their licenses.

149
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:48,830
That's not the point.

150
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:51,399
The point is, how did I
meet this young woman?

151
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,935
Well, I got caught unexpectedly
in a rainstorm one day, so I

152
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,136
retreated into a local theater.

153
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:57,405
There, I caught a matinee.

154
00:04:57,473 --> 00:05:00,241
And during this matinee,
I saw this young woman.

155
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,977
I introduced myself, and we both
got caught up in the moment, and

156
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:05,013
we said yes to the new
experience, and that's how I

157
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,282
wound up with this wonderful
and very sexual hickey.

158
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,283
Oh.

159
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,285
You see what I'm saying
about adventure, Charlie?

160
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,654
Yeah, you always say
yes to everything.

161
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,756
Well, no, I don't always say yes.

162
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:15,757
That's absurd.

163
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,759
I'd be a dead man, wouldn't I,
if I said yes to everything?

164
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:18,927
Yeah. Oh, shit, dude.

165
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:20,328
Look at that truck right there.

166
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:21,396
Oh, yeah.

167
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,398
You think there's someone in there?

168
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,900
Well... what do we say in
this scenario, Charlie?

169
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:27,068
We say yes.

170
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:30,371
We say yes.

171
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,609
Hiya.

172
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:35,944
Sorry to wake you up there.

173
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,945
Sorry.

174
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,046
What do you want?

175
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:40,048
Oh, uh, our car broke down a
little ways back, and we were

176
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,050
hoping maybe you could help us out.

177
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:44,052
Oh, I could, uh, radio that in
and get you a tow truck out

178
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,054
here, but I'm about to
hit the road myself.

179
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,056
You can always hitch a ride with me.

180
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,157
Oh. Uh, where you headed?

181
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,792
Atlantic City.

182
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:55,864
You got any munchies in the car?

183
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:56,865
I'm grumbling.

184
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:58,867
No, Frank, we don't have
anything in the car because we

185
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,202
were starving ourselves
for the casino buffet.

186
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,271
It was only supposed to
be a 45-minute drive.

187
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,806
I got to eat pretty soon.

188
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:05,707
I'm starting to get woozy.

189
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:08,409
Yeah, I'm starting to get woozy, too.

190
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:10,612
I've been starving myself
for a few days for Chase.

191
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,713
What?

192
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,983
Oh, I wanted to create that sort
of gaunt, angular look with

193
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,653
my cheekbones to impress him, you know,
give myself a more athletic look.

194
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:20,522
But... I'm starving.

195
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,814
All right, let's jump into the forest,
and we'll find some food there.

196
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,565
*

197
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,099
*

198
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:29,592
We are not killing any animals, okay?

199
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,833
Screw that! I'm hungry.

200
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,655
It's wabbit season.

201
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,603
Okay, fine.

202
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:36,704
Dee, come with me.

203
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,009
I'm gonna find us something to eat.

204
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:41,426
Where are you, wabbit?

205
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm gonna get you, wabbit.

206
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,384
Oh.

207
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,252
There you are.

208
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,597
What the hell!

209
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:59,439
Wabbit?

210
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,106
Where'd you go?

211
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,503
Shit!

212
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,473
How'd you do that?

213
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,543
Why are you staring at me?

214
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,912
Why you giving me that look?

215
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,048
Whoa.

216
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:24,285
We're having a moment here, aren't we?

217
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:40,348
You boys are, uh...
awfully dressed up.

218
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,983
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, the tuxes.

219
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,687
Sure, yeah, well, we're on our way to
Atlantic City for a charity event.

220
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:47,822
You kind of threw me
with those outfits.

221
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,160
Don't usually find lot lizards out in
the wild.
Yeah, you know what, I'm a

222
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:53,561
little behind on my trucker terms.

223
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,598
A "lot lizard" would be a, uh...?

224
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,333
A lizard.

225
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,334
You know, truck stop whores.

226
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,902
- I mean...
- Oh!

227
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,670
Oh!

228
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:02,938
No, no... no offense.

229
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,306
No, man, none taken.

230
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,307
Because we're not whores.

231
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:07,309
No, no, we're not prostitutes.

232
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,310
Definitely not a lizard.

233
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:10,178
Hey, hey, hey, shh.

234
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,346
Hey.

235
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:12,914
Your secret's safe with me.

236
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,082
Don't worry, too, I'm not a cop.

237
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,251
And I'm not gonna judge you, neither.

238
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,254
A man's got to make a living, and looking
the way you do, I'm not surprised.

239
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:20,255
I'm not surprised.

240
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:23,258
Oh, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, but again...
Not lizards, though.

241
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:24,259
Not prostitutes.

242
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:27,262
Save your seduction for
someone else, all right?

243
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,397
I do not tangle with lizards no more.

244
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:33,802
No. Back in the day, sure,
I would've indulged, hell!

245
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:38,139
I would've let you turn me
into Swiss cheese.

246
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,943
I would've let you make me a...
make me into a mailbox... just

247
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:44,479
open the slot and put
whatever you want inside.

248
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,614
Oh...
Not no more.

249
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:47,782
I got a wife now.

250
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,220
So I will not suck you, and I
will not be sucked on... by you.

251
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:53,254
'Kay?

252
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:54,756
That's it.

253
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:55,890
That's a 10-4.

254
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,694
Yeah, we read you loud and clear,
and just to reiterate, we

255
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:03,698
- don't suck on people... we own a bar.
- So... You run a bar?

256
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,168
Yeah, well, I'm sure you do.

257
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,050
*

258
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:09,249
*

259
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:13,261
*

260
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,538
*

261
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:19,705
It's grass, Mac.

262
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,433
You're eating grass.

263
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:22,490
Well, look, I see Charlie eating
grass all the time, okay?

264
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:23,491
Oh, really?

265
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,493
Okay, well, Charlie is not an
example of good health, so...

266
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,495
Look, Charlie is a
survivor, all right?

267
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,497
And that's the way we have to
think... eat anything to survive.

268
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:32,066
Oh. What is that?

269
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,601
That's a dead crow.

270
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,403
Well, I'm definitely not eating that.

271
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,839
Wait, whoa, whoa. Why not?

272
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:40,241
Because it is a disgusting
dead bird, that's why.

273
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:43,244
You eat dead chickens and dead turkeys
all the time... That's so hypocritical.

274
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,047
Okay, that's not hypocritical...
People eat chickens and turkeys.

275
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:46,914
Nobody eats a crow.

276
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:47,915
It's a trash bird.

277
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:48,950
You know what I do think?

278
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:50,885
I think we're gonna give
this crow a proper burial.

279
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:51,986
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

280
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:54,288
But what I will is use it as bait.

281
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,290
Ooh. What if we hide in the
bushes, and then we wait for

282
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,292
something higher on the food
chain to come along and grab it,

283
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,294
- and then we grab that and eat it...
- That's a good idea.

284
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,295
I'm gonna go to the car.

285
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,063
I'm not doing it. No.

286
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,865
I'm gonna go to the car and
I'm gonna get a blanket, then

287
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,234
we can pick up this trash bird
with it, and we'll do my plan.

288
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:06,968
I'm not helping you.

289
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,636
That's all right, I'll do
it myself... I'll eat alone.

290
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,605
I'm gonna find Frank, I'm gonna
get him on my team, okay?

291
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:11,093
Good.

292
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:15,490
Frank?

293
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:18,646
Hey, Frank, where are you, bro?

294
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:19,947
Oh, there you are.

295
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,048
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

296
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,571
Mac, I'm having a
thing with this rabbit here.

297
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:28,055
Whoa, dude!

298
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:30,725
He's staring right at you.

299
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:34,162
We've been staring at each
other for ten minutes.

300
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:36,164
I-I... He's not afraid of me.

301
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:39,400
He's looking at me like he knows
me, he's looking at me like he

302
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:40,635
can see right through my soul.

303
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:42,270
He probably can, dude.

304
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,772
That is the connection
between man and beast.

305
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,008
Animals can see souls.

306
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:48,343
That is a fact of nature.

307
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:52,847
Oh!

308
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,849
Deandra, what the hell are you doing?!

309
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,150
Oh, you guys, I got it.

310
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:57,185
I got it.

311
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:57,985
We can eat.

312
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:59,787
We can't eat the rabbit...
He's got my soul.

313
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:00,822
What are you talking about?

314
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:01,856
They had a moment, Dee.

315
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:02,790
They shared a connection.

316
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,959
I know it's cute, you guys, but,
come on, this isn't about

317
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:06,727
us anymore... I got to feed the baby.

318
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,930
Mac, grab it by the head
and wring its neck off.

319
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:11,499
I would rather grab your head and
wring your neck, for wanting

320
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,533
to kill this rabbit, all right?

321
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,936
You want to eat it
so bad, you kill it.

322
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:16,070
Fine. I will kill it.

323
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:18,172
I'll kill it, and I'll eat it myself.

324
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,372
I'm gonna kill the
shit out of it.

325
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:29,908
*

326
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:34,970
*

327
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,823
Great, yeah, thanks.

328
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,392
No, we were hoping to be dropped
off at a casino, though.

329
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,827
This is just a motel.

330
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:46,733
I know, and I thought we would slip into
a room, and you... could check my oil.

331
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:51,939
- Oh. No. Um...
- What happened, man?

332
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:52,707
No, I'm sorry. No.

333
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:53,407
No.

334
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:57,311
Shoot, hell, maybe I knew I wanted it when I...
I gave you the ride.

335
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,280
No, no, no, no, you're better...
Byron.

336
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,114
Remember you changed?

337
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:02,717
Byron, you've changed... you don't
want this kind of thing anymore.

338
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:04,252
No, I do want this kind of thing.

339
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,052
No, you don't.

340
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,355
You would not suck me and you
would not, um, be sucked by me.

341
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,222
Be sucked by us.

342
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,156
I take that back.

343
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:09,891
I don't mean that.

344
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,993
You can't take that back, Byron!

345
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,028
- I didn't mean any of those...
- Look, man, think about your

346
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,563
wife... Remember, you
said you love your wife.

347
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:16,264
I do, I do, I do.

348
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:16,931
Good.

349
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:21,002
I do, but... I got cash
in my pocket, I got desire in my

350
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,604
heart, and I'm a-frothin' and
a-foamin', and I was thinking...

351
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:26,674
Hey, hey, I got an idea.

352
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:32,146
What do you say...
we slip into a room and you two

353
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:33,147
split me open like a coconut?

354
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:36,717
Oh... Dennis, what do we
say in this situation?

355
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:37,451
We say no.

356
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,687
Why? No? Why?

357
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:41,555
It's just... Oh, my God!

358
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:43,891
Another...

359
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:47,028
Should've locked my damn door.

360
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:50,031
I should've locked the door.

361
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:55,569
Yeah, well, that was
definitely an adventure, huh?

362
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:58,072
Yeah, well, sometimes the
adventures aren't always good ones.

363
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,474
Yeah, but I said yes to the
new experience, right?

364
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:03,778
I'm out of Philly, I'm alive, and
I'm not afraid of truckers anymore.

365
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:06,347
Yeah, well, if anything, you should
be more afraid of truckers now.

366
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,348
But I do see your point.

367
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,356
Hey, listen, I'm gonna try and get
in touch with the guys, okay?

368
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:13,554
Aw, shit.

369
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,723
Dude, I left my jacket in the truck.

370
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,024
I had everything in that jacket.

371
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,794
I had all my money, I had my
phone... do you have any money?

372
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:21,796
Uh, yeah, it's all right there.

373
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,230
I put it all on black.

374
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:24,632
What? No, no, no, no, no!

375
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,599
Black wins!

376
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,801
Baby!

377
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,836
Oh, phew! All right, but that
was lucky, that was lucky.

378
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:31,105
Yeah, I know, but you know
what, dude, you were right...

379
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,007
I said yes to this little
adventure and I won.

380
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,508
Would you like to bet again, sir?

381
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:35,276
Yes, I would.

382
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,143
No. No. No.

383
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,044
Let it ride, please.

384
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:37,912
What are you doing?

385
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,580
Dude, I am gonna say
yes to everything!

386
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,982
We can't say yes to everything.

387
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:42,183
That is all of our money, dude.

388
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,050
No, it's all my money.

389
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,552
You lost yours when you
said no to the trucker.

390
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,876
What? Did you want to say yes
to the trucker?

391
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:48,073
*

392
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,739
*

393
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,360
walk away with a free 18-wheeler.

394
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,495
Dude, we are gonna
lose all of our money.

395
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:55,363
Black wins again!

396
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,898
Oh, baby! Whoo! Yes!

397
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,200
Yes, yes!

398
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:00,201
Let it ride, please.

399
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:00,868
Let it ride.

400
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:03,904
Okay, okay, yeah, let it ride.

401
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:08,676
I want to bash you, bunny.

402
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:12,046
I want to give you one good bash and
eat your sweet, delicious meat.

403
00:14:12,114 --> 00:14:14,349
You can't kill the rabbit,
Deandra... It's got my soul.

404
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,516
It's got the man's soul, Dee.

405
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:16,718
Maybe I'll suffocate you.

406
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,287
I'll suffocate your rabbit face,
and then I'll just suck all the

407
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:23,091
- life out of it and then... twist your neck and...
- Look, can we do this thing,

408
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:24,258
for crying out loud?

409
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,293
Yes, absolutely.

410
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,329
This is absolutely ridiculous,
holding a funeral for a crow.

411
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:29,597
Yes, that's right, we are.

412
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:30,732
We are honoring its life.

413
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,033
I want to say a couple words.

414
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:32,767
Yes, please.

415
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:36,537
Uh, I've never been good to animals,
wearing a leather suit and all.

416
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:40,908
And, uh, also, I kicked a dog
in a subway once, it was a real

417
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:44,212
jerk move, and I'm really sorry I
did it, and I like animals now.

418
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,113
That was beautiful, Frank.

419
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,848
Okay, where the hell are
Charlie and Dennis?

420
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,683
I feel like they're not
coming back for us.

421
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:50,485
Okay, they're coming back, okay?

422
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:54,422
Guys... Let's just do the right thing.

423
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,858
Good night... sweet prince.

424
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:01,262
Oh, God, you-you got to be kidding me.
Come on.

425
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,399
FRANK AND MAC: # Ave Maria... #

426
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:07,769
Are you kidding me?

427
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,075
I mean, I never thought
I would hold $15,000.

428
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,076
Amazing, bro.

429
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:17,078
Listen, I thought I was
teaching you today.

430
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:20,081
Let me tell you something, my
friend, you were teaching me.

431
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,343
I know. I mean, look at
all this amazing food.

432
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,170
Oh, I'm starving.!

433
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,312
*

434
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,887
What is that?

435
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,741
Hi, there.
You two are with the Reynolds party, yes?

436
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,909
Yeah. Yes.

437
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:29,910
Is one of you Frank?

438
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,912
Oh, actually, uh...
Yes.

439
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,580
Hi, Mr. Reynolds.

440
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:34,681
I'm Debra.

441
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:35,882
We spoke on the phone.

442
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,883
Yes. Yes.

443
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:39,786
Well, now, I know you'd
like to say a few words.

444
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:41,955
Is it all right if we
have you up to speak now?

445
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,991
Uh...
Yes, it is.

446
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:44,992
Great.

447
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,527
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

448
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,897
Mr. Reynolds here is one
of our largest new donors.

449
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:55,927
Well, it's donors like him that makes
our work for animals possible.

450
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:58,639
Thank you.

451
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,140
Thank you.

452
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,341
I am Frank Reynolds.

453
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:02,342
Yes, yes, yes.

454
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,511
Yes, yes.

455
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,512
Yes.

456
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,015
That's the word I want to talk about.

457
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,384
But first, let's talk about animals.

458
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:11,451
Yeah.

459
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,654
If animals have taught me
anything, it's that you can

460
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:18,859
easily die, and very quickly, under
a bus and on the side of the road.

461
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:19,860
Yes.

462
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,862
Okay?
So you have to live in the now.

463
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:22,863
Live in the now!

464
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,864
Mm-hmm.

465
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,866
I'm gonna live in the now right now.

466
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,702
I'm gonna donate another $5,000
to this charity right now.

467
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,770
Oh! Oh!

468
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:32,606
That's a...
That's too generous.

469
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:33,607
This is for the rats.

470
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,608
Take it easy.

471
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:35,509
All right. Oh!

472
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,510
For the rats, people.

473
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:38,512
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

474
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,513
And I'm done.

475
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,514
Good, good.

476
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,816
Uh, Mr. Reynolds,
there's one more thing.

477
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,485
Per your request, we were able
to arrange a surprise night for

478
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:48,889
your friend with two true
all-stars of our organization...

479
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:53,193
Chase Utley and Ryan Howard
of the Philadelphia Phillies.

480
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,528
Oh!

481
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:58,632
Hi.

482
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,833
Mac, right?

483
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,768
Uh... yes.

484
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:04,004
I hear you're my number one fan.

485
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:06,173
Yes, I am.

486
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,474
Hi. Hi.

487
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,141
Hi.

488
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,242
What's up, brother.

489
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,243
All right.

490
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:11,244
Oh, my goodness.

491
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:12,245
All right, let's get crazy.

492
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:13,246
Let's get crazy.

493
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,247
Let's get nuts, you guys.

494
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,716
Go get nuts, guys.

495
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:18,385
# I had a friend Was a
big baseball player #

496
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,387
Ah.

497
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:27,894
# Bac Bin high school We went back
inside, sat down Had a few drinks... #

498
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:30,497
- And you got a, uh...
- Please don't touch me.

499
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:35,535
# Glory days Yeah, they'll
pass you by Glory days #

500
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,838
I'm gonna need some more of that.

501
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,466
# Of a young Got it.

502
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,114
# Yeah They'll pass you by... #

503
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,081
No Mets fans!

504
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:49,082
Get out of here.

505
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,083
No Mets fans!

506
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:52,085
What are you thinking?

507
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:53,086
# Glory days... #

508
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,354
All right.

509
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,589
# Glory days... #

510
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:02,629
Ooh.

511
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,631
# Ooh, yeah All right... #

512
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:08,001
# All right... #

513
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,637
Yeah!

514
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,640
# Ooh, yeah Oh, yeah All right #

515
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,641
# All right #

516
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:15,642
# All right... #

517
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,713
Guys, guys, calm down.

518
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:20,714
You're gonna hurt each other.

519
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:21,715
Huh?

520
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:22,716
No, we're good, man.

521
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:23,717
We're just having fun.

522
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,719
I just saw you bite that dude.

523
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,721
- Yeah, it was a...
- He took a bite.

524
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:28,722
It was a fair bite.

525
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,724
Yeah, I do like to
bite him a little bit.

526
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,725
Man, come here, come here.

527
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:32,726
Wrestle with us, dude.

528
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:33,727
Hey, yeah.

529
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:34,728
You guys are wasted, man.

530
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:35,729
Let's wrestle.

531
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:36,730
Yeah, you're wasted.

532
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:37,731
No, we're not.

533
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,732
You're not wasted?

534
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,701
No, no, we're completely sober,
but you guys drank a lot, though.

535
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:42,702
Yeah.

536
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,704
You guys drink more than
anybody I've ever seen.

537
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:45,705
Oh, really, dude?

538
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:46,706
Oh, really?

539
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:47,707
Ah...

540
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:48,708
Good work, Charlie. Yeah.

541
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:49,476
That's what we do.

542
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:54,014
Well, you know, it's been great, fellas,
but, uh, we're gonna take off now.

543
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:55,015
Oh!

544
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,116
Really? You guys gonna go?

545
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:57,984
Yeah, you guys, try not to
hurt anybody tonight, okay?

546
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:58,985
Nah, dude, nah.

547
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,020
No, no, no, we're good, dude.

548
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:01,021
We're good, dude.

549
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:02,756
Get off me, though, for reals.

550
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:03,423
Okay.

551
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:04,090
You guys take care, okay?

552
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:04,925
Yeah.

553
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:05,926
All right.

554
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,594
Whoo! Boy, that was a...

555
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:08,929
...hell of a night, man.

556
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:10,263
Hell of a night, man.

557
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,265
Hey, how much money do we have left?

558
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,233
10,000 bucks.

559
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:17,771
I got an idea how we
can spend that shit.

560
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,772
Champagne!

561
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,906
Champagne!

562
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:20,907
Champagne! Champagne!

563
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:22,909
Here we go, gentlemen.

564
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,414
Thank you, Penelope.

565
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,618
Oh, it's tearing me up inside.

566
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:33,019
What? What?!

567
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,988
What's going on?

568
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:36,756
Frank, what are you doing?

569
00:19:36,824 --> 00:19:39,025
I ate the crow.

570
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,627
What... what'd he say?

571
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:41,628
What?

572
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,029
I ate the crow.

573
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,297
Why?

574
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:45,765
I dug it up last night.

575
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,702
I thought it would taste like
chicken, but I was wrong.

576
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:49,803
Oh, my God.

577
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:52,038
I think I got to go to a hospital.

578
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,039
All right.

579
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:55,998
All right, look, they're clearly
not coming back for us, okay?

580
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:57,273
*

581
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,314
Oh.

582
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:03,016
Oh, man.

583
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,719
Seriously, I'm gonna be sad
when this is all over.

584
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:10,156
Yeah, well, all good adventures
must come to an end at some point.

585
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:11,224
All good things are ending.

586
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,995
I shouldn't still be drinking.

587
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,096
Hey.

588
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,230
Mm-hmn?

589
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,799
I just thought of one last
thing that would be awesome.

590
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:20,567
Give me your phone.

591
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,577
All right.

592
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,776
Oh, this is gonna be...
this is gonna be awesome, dude.

593
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:30,777
It's just gonna be great.

594
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:34,881
Look at this.

595
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:37,517
I know, it feels like we're
walking a lot here, bunny, but I

596
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:39,486
tell you what, as soon as we get
back to the bar, you can have as

597
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,688
many carrots as your
little heart desires.

598
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:44,691
Dee, first you wanted to kill it, and
now you're bringing it back to the bar?

599
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,692
Yeah.

600
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,161
I named him "Peter, Peter, Nickel-Eater".

601
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,864
'Cause last night in the car,
he tried to eat a nickel.

602
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,899
It was the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

603
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,402
I say you bash its
brains in right now.

604
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:57,170
I'm done liking animals.

605
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:59,506
This crow is eating me alive!

606
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:04,044
Frank, you are sick because
you ate rancid, maggot-filled

607
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,412
meat, not because of animals.

608
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,647
And, Dee, you've got to
set that rabbit free.

609
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:08,715
Really?

610
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:12,619
Yes! It needs to live in the
wild, where it can be free and

611
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,722
safe in the loving embrace
of Mother Nature, okay?

612
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,825
Trust me, Peter Nickels-Eater
is gonna be much happier.

613
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,627
Yeah, all right.

614
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:21,695
You're right.

615
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,698
Okay, buddy, I love you, but
go back to your family now.

616
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:25,699
Go on.

617
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:26,700
Okay.

618
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,501
See? He's happier already.

619
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:32,005
He's gonna go back to his mother
and father, and he's gonna have

620
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,473
a wonderful life.

621
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,311
God... damn it!

622
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,613
Goddamn it!

623
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,614
Okay, nature is bullshit.

624
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:41,615
I'm done with this.

625
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:42,749
I told you, animals suck.

626
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:46,019
Oh. Wait. Was that a text?

627
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:46,987
You getting reception?

628
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,755
Yes, I guess I'm getting
reception... I just got a text.

629
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:49,756
Oh, it's from Dennis.

630
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:50,757
Ooh.

631
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:53,827
I think he sent me a picture.

632
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:56,062
No.

633
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,831
No!

634
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:00,433
Oh! You guys, you guys, a car!
Hey!

635
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:01,434
No.

636
00:22:01,502 --> 00:22:02,469
Hi-yo!

637
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:03,470
Hey! Wait-wait-wait-wait!

638
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:04,471
Wait!

639
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:05,538
Oh, good.

640
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:07,607
Hey there!

641
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:08,608
Y'all need a ride?

642
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:09,609
Yes. Yes.

643
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,896
Yeah.

644
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,403
Must be hot, huh?

645
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:17,539
Hey you. Mr. Hottie. Come on now.
