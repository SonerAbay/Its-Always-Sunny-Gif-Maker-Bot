2
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,171
You painted your butt blue...

3
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,841
and nobody noticed the hole in your pants?

4
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,442
- Yeah, it worked. It worked.
- Good trick.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,851
As long as it works.

6
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,237
- Yeah!
- That's the way to start a day.

7
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,009
And we got news. We got news too.

8
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,913
Ooh. Great song <i>and</i> great news?

9
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,179
Yeah, and it's all tied in with the song,
so it makes sense.

10
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:23,017
- What's the news?
- Psycho Pete!

11
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,647
Psycho Pete's back in town.

12
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,191
- Wait, what?
- Whoa.

13
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,887
- We're gonna get our psycho back, bitches.
- Wait a minute.

14
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:31,795
The guy you went to high school with
who killed and ate his family?

15
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,355
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,094
Yeah, but don't get all hung up on that.

17
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:36,692
He's out of the loony bin, all right?

18
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,704
So... We're getting the freight train
back together, right?

19
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,262
- Freight train!
- Freight train!

20
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:05,324
This is not good.

21
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:08,424
There's no way we can have a maniac
hanging out in our bar.

22
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:09,992
He's fine though. Okay?

23
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,231
Look, they unscrambled his brain
and he's, like, good now.

24
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:14,296
- Yeah, they sorted him out.
They sorted him out. - No.

25
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:18,174
You cannot sort out a man
who kills and eats other human beings.

26
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,906
The hospital said he's fine,
so he's fine.

27
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,470
- The man did the time.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:24,813
No, no, no, no.
I lived with these maniacs in the loony bin.

29
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,479
There is no curing those psycho bastards.

30
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:29,044
It's actually really sad...

31
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,852
but once your brain's a piece of shit,
it's always a piece of shit.

32
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:36,862
There is no way we're having that psychotic
mutant anywhere near our bar.

33
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,228
- That's all there is to it.
- Excuse me.

34
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,824
Hey, I'm talking to my friends here, so...

35
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:44,666
Charlie, seriously,
keep that psycho killer away from us, man.

36
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,228
Charlie.

37
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:47,864
It's me. It's Peter.

38
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:50,842
I don't know any Peters,
so I don't know how you know my name...

39
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:53,038
but if you want a beer,
just go have a beer, freak.

40
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,138
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Peter?

41
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,206
- Pete, is that you?
- Wait, Psycho Pete?

42
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,149
- Hey, Ronald.
- Oh!

43
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,312
Dude, you look gnarly.

44
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,413
I did not recognize you, man.

45
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,185
Psycho Pete!

46
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,249
What happened to your hair?
You used to have all that hair.

47
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,023
Did you, like, yank it out in a fit of rage?
That's pretty psycho.

48
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:13,532
- No, it's just genetics.
- Aw, genetics. So psycho!

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,295
What are they feeding you, bro?

50
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,303
- I mean, you look huge. Look at that mass.
- You were like 85 pounds before.

51
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,236
Yeah, struggling
with my weight for a while now.

52
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,138
Yeah. Meds don't help.

53
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,541
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- A psycho struggle!

54
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:28,274
- Hey, we got something cued up for you here,
man. Oh! - Yeah, we brought something.

55
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,544
Come on, come on.
Be the caboose. Be the caboose.

56
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:38,056
Actually, you know,
j-just turn the music down. Just a bit.

57
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,660
Oh, yeah, sorry. We were gonna do
the freight train song for you.

58
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,492
So, what-what do you want to do?

59
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,657
You want to get nuts?
You want to get into some shit?

60
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:47,961
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

61
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,298
You used to go right up to babies
in carriages...

62
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,600
and just scream in their faces,
you know, they'd cry?

63
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:53,934
Uh, dude, that was psycho.

64
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,838
I-I don't feel good about that stuff.

65
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,900
I actually regret
a lot of the stuff we used to do.

66
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,672
- Do you?
- So, um...

67
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:03,409
Do you think I could, like,
grab a glass of water or something?

68
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,246
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

69
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,479
- Charlie, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:13,016
- This guy sucks now.
- Oh, my God.

71
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,891
- Like, I don't like him at all.
- No. He's, like, not psycho at all.

72
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:19,227
- No, it's like Mild-mannered Pete.
- More like Boring Pete.

73
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,130
- I thought something like this might happen.
- Did you?

74
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,193
- I got a plan.
- 'Cause they mess with their brains up there.

75
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,794
- Hey, uh, Pete?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,772
We're gonna go.

77
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,274
Okay.

78
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,105
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah.

79
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:36,343
Pete.

80
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,974
Sorry about the stuff I was saying...

81
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,849
- about the mentally insane earlier.
- Did that anger you?

82
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:46,684
I didn't mean to call
psychotic people mutants.

83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,284
It's cool.

84
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:50,626
- You know, oh...
- Oh.

85
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:53,564
We had the, uh...
Oh, geez, and that's right now.

86
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,067
- Shoot, I wish I could stay.
- Yeah, me too.

87
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,330
- Adios.
- Okay.

88
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,996
- Water.
- See you, man. Good luck.

89
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,207
Hey.

90
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,410
Charlie, you know, the main problem...

91
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,347
with people going
to these state-run loony bins...

92
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,352
is the separation between church and state.

93
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,944
Explain.

94
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,457
You spend most of your time
talking to a therapist instead of a priest.

95
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,653
A priest is gonna let you off the hook
for all the things that you've done.

96
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,559
- You heard Pete. He feels guilty.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,599
- He needs to be absolved, so that
he can go psycho again. - Okay.

98
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,156
- Yeah.
- I gue... I guess I see that.

99
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:31,795
Look, dude, I feel guilty all the time
for my thoughts and urges...

100
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,532
but I'm not gonna talk to a therapist...

101
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,803
who's gonna make me, you know,
deal with it and confront those issues.

102
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,538
I talk to a priest,
he lets me off the hook. I move on.

103
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,603
- Here's our guy. Hey!
- Hey!

104
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,171
- Cricket!
- Aw, man.

105
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,217
- Crick, Crick, Crick, Crick, Crick...
- Cricket, Cricket, Cricket.

106
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,913
- What do you guys want, huh?
- Can we ever get a warm reception from you?

107
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,353
Yeah, it's never a nice "hello."
What's the cloak thing too?

108
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:52,687
What are you doing here?
A <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> thing, or what?

109
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,522
I don't like it. Take it off.

110
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,721
- Pop it off. We're trying to have a conversation.
- Holy shit!

111
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,229
- Put it back on!
- Put it on!

112
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,323
- Put it back on!
- What the hell happened to your face?

113
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,958
- You want to know what happened?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,525
This happened to me...

115
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,901
when I was locked
in your burning apartment at Thanksgiving.

116
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,236
- Nah, you weren't there.
- I don't think you were there, man.

117
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:11,402
I was there, Mac, and my whole face
burned off. I remember I was there.

118
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,742
Why would we want <i>you</i>
at Thanksgiving dinner?

119
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,542
Especially looking like that.
You would've freaked everyone out.

120
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,879
This happened at your apartment!

121
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,249
- I can't follow a thing this guy's saying.
- Guys, can we just focus?

122
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,447
- How do you not follow?
- Cricket, we need something from you.

123
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,581
Yeah, we need something.
And we brought you beer.

124
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,147
Beer?

125
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,421
Yeah, okay, fine, I'll help you.
Just give me the beers.

126
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,725
Oh, whoa, whoa! There's five more there.
What about the others?

127
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,925
- They're not all for you.
- I'm gonna give you all the beer in the world?

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,661
What do you guys want? What do you want?

129
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:38,203
Okay, we need you to hear
our friend's confession...

130
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,898
and then absolve him of his sins.

131
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:42,237
Ah. And?

132
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,936
- That's the whole thing. That's what priests do.
- Yeah, that's it.

133
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,376
That's it?

134
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:49,108
I don't need to suck him or anything or...
let him inside me?

135
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,013
Why would I want you to... No.

136
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:52,642
- Dude, that's it.
- Just hear the confession.

137
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,052
All right. But if he winds up inside me,
it will cost you a whole sixer.

138
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,919
I mean, that... I got my dignity.

139
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,891
- Well, let's go, bud.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,824
Yeah. Let me get one
of those other beers too.

141
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,760
- You gotta earn it.
- You have to earn it.

142
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,793
So, we'll talk to
the hospital administrators.

143
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:11,734
We'll let 'em know
that they've made a mistake.

144
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:14,205
Mistake?
No, I can't imagine they let him go.

145
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:16,742
- I'm sure he must've escaped, right?
- I don't like loony bins.

146
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,744
- This is giving me a really bad feeling.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:21,508
That's understandable, Frank,
but these places, they're a necessary evil.

148
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,277
We gotta trust the system.
Let's just get Pete back into the system.

149
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,181
That's right.
There's a system in place for everything.

150
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:28,152
- We don't have to panic.
Everything's gonna be fine. - Yeah.

151
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,951
Is it locked?

152
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:32,992
- Let's go.
- Hello?

153
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,253
Hang on. What is going on here?

154
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,855
Looks like this place
has been shut down for months.

155
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,269
Oh, my God, Dennis, listen to this.

156
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:47,465
"Reed Mental Institution was shut down
because of statewide cutbacks."

157
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,508
Oh, so they just cut all the loonies loose?

158
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,511
What? How could they do that?
That's-That's insane!

159
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,513
I guess it was either that
or raise our taxes.

160
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,549
<i>What?</i> Raise my taxes? Come on.

161
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,914
How much do these vultures need?
I already pay a ton in taxes.

162
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,317
Then I guess they're gonna have to
shut down more of these places.

163
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:04,686
<i>What?</i> Shut down more of these...
We gotta have somewhere to send our lunatics.

164
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,247
Then we're going to have to pay more taxes.

165
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,987
<i>What?</i> I'm not paying more in taxes.

166
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,926
I won't do it. Don't speak of it again!

167
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,827
This is strange.

168
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,799
I swear, this is all too familiar.

169
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,837
Whoa.

170
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,740
It's okay, Froggy.

171
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,642
I'll keep you moist.

172
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,417
Oh.

173
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,418
This is it! This is it!

174
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,047
What?
What are you babbling about?

175
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:14,719
This is the nitwit school
I was shanghaied to when I was a kid.

176
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:18,059
That one that you had your mommy tell them
to tell you that you didn't have donkey brains.

177
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,565
I knew I didn't have donkey brains.

178
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,157
But everybody else did.

179
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,499
Especially my roommate, the frog kid.

180
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,435
Oh, you had a frog kid roommate? Sure.

181
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,440
Froggy and I used to
take care of each other.

182
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,136
He was a good kid.
We watched each other's back.

183
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,110
One time, we escaped...

184
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,309
and they chased us down
with those big nets they use to catch dogs.

185
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,675
Did you grow up in a cartoon?

186
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,313
I can't believe they set them loose.

187
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,653
Froggy can't be in the world out there.

188
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:47,522
Froggy never did anything wrong.

189
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,254
I gotta find Froggy.

190
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,854
Froggy! Froggy!

191
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,458
- He's unzipped. - Yeah, all right,
look. What are we gonna do, Dee?

192
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,025
We can't have Pete wandering the streets.

193
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,435
I don't want him near me.
We gotta get him sent somewhere.

194
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:02,099
Or... Ooh! What about that nut, uh...
nuthouse in West Chester?

195
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,008
- Ah, it says that one's been shut down too.
- Oh, come on!

196
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:07,808
I pay so much money in taxes already.
Where's that going?

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,111
Well, they used that money to open up
the Eagles' new practice facility.

198
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:12,845
That makes sense.
That's kind of a no-brainer.

199
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,819
- We can't have our guys out
there twisting ankles. - Yeah.

200
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,549
A man of Shady McCoy's abilities,
he needs a proper landing strip.

201
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,853
Gotta get our maniacs in green
set up in a nice facility.

202
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,587
- Sophie's choice, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,356
Oof. Go Birds.

204
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:25,727
Go Birds. Go Birds.

205
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,005
Is there something
weighing on your mind, my son?

206
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:36,735
Wh-What?

207
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,367
Who... Who is that?

208
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:42,642
It's time to confess your sins.

209
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,979
Unburden yourself and be absolved.

210
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,575
Is that a glory hole?

211
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,586
Yes. It is, my son.

212
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:52,818
But it'll cost you a whole sixer if you want
to unburden yourself in that way.

213
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:57,090
Uh, that being said, I'm... open to it.

214
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,621
- Stay on topic here, man.
- Just absolve the man and let's go.

215
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,361
I don't even know what I'm absolving him of.

216
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:03,925
All right? He has to
confess something first.

217
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,698
What's going on in here?

218
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,536
We'll just do the confession for him
and God'll get what we're going for.

219
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,473
- Cricket, we're gonna confess.
- Okay, fine.

220
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:15,503
All right, um, he used to
scream in babies' faces.

221
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,416
Well, that's just funny.

222
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,921
- They'd be all freaked out.
- Okay, no, you know what he used to do?

223
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,185
- He used to gather, like, cats and dogs...
- Oh, yeah.

224
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,727
And then put them into a little room
and have 'em battle it out.

225
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,695
That's just cats'
and dogs' nature, to fight...

226
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,253
so I don't see a problem with that.

227
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,459
- Oh, also, he murdered and ate his family.
- Right.

228
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,025
What?

229
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,900
See, there was like
a Christmas dinner thing...

230
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,963
with the eating of his family
and a burning of the house down.

231
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,874
- Is this Psycho Pete?
- Yeah, yeah.

232
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,139
Jesus Christ! That guy's a goddamn maniac.

233
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,703
I'm not absolving him. He should be in jail.

234
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:49,907
Hey, guys?

235
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,309
Pete, is that you?

236
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,786
- Hey, man.
- I'm gonna get out of here, okay?

237
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:59,018
- Oh.
- I'm gonna use... use the women's restroom.

238
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,583
Oh, sure!
Yeah, a lot of people in here.

239
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,151
- Kind of a full house.
- Yeah.

240
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,821
Yeah, the women's room, I'm sure, is...

241
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,387
- Goddamn it, Cricket.
- Uh, is it safe?

242
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,730
- Is it safe to be here?
- Relax, Cricket. It's safe.

243
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:11,599
The guy's all docile and shit now.
He's on these meds...

244
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,901
No, look, he-he might
look calm on the outside...

245
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,668
but there's a storm brewing on the inside.

246
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,402
I think I know what the problem is.

247
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:19,172
He's psycho.

248
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:21,440
He's straight-up possessed by the devil.

249
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,676
- Okay, you lost me.
- Okay, think about it.

250
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,741
He used to be fun crazy. You know?

251
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,151
And the devil was like,
"I like this dude. I'm gonna get involved."

252
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,214
He jumps in there, makes him <i>evil</i> crazy.

253
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,283
Then the meds get thrown on top.
They shut everybody down.

254
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,295
Okay.

255
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,297
All right, so where you going with that?

256
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:42,129
We gotta get him off
the meds and get the devil out.

257
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,692
- You want to do an exorcism?
- Of course I want to do an exorcism.

258
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,635
- That's what the whole thing...
- That's where I come in.

259
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,435
Why didn't you come out like,
"Let's do an exorcism"?

260
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:50,169
I can't lead with the exorcism.

261
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:51,904
We'll get the demon and the goblin out...

262
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,536
and we'll have our fun Pete back.

263
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,946
- I want to get the demon out but not a goblin.
- We should get 'em all out.

264
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,143
Get the demon, the goblin, the ghoul,
and then you got Pete.

265
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,708
Well, no, no, no, no.

266
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:03,482
There's no goblins.
There's no ghouls. It's just demons, okay?

267
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:07,151
- Well, they're all made up. - That's why
he burned your face, you son of a bitch!

268
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,160
- Yeah, that's true, man.
- Okay, look, I'm getting hot.

269
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,786
- I'm getting too hot.
- Yeah, we're getting hot.

270
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,558
Let's just go get the exorcism going.

271
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,725
And let's get you, like, a hat or a hood or...

272
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,839
All right, now listen.
Let me talk to this doctor, okay?

273
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,341
I'll explain to him that we have
a dangerous psychopath in our bar...

274
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,309
and he could snap at any minute.

275
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,209
And because there are
no facilities to lock him in...

276
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,145
we need to get him his medication
as soon as possible...

277
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,547
- in order to avoid a massacre.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

278
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:35,383
Just let me handle this. I'll act crazy
and then he'll prescribe them to me.

279
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,115
You will sit here and you will be quiet.

280
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,920
Your bad acting will only confuse him
and it will infuriate me.

281
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:41,653
I'm gonna ask him about the frog kid.

282
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,524
- Don't do that. Don't do that.
- Oh, my God.

283
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,429
No, Froggy and I need each other.
He's out there all alone.

284
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:47,932
- You...
- I'm gonna find Froggy.

285
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,525
You are never gonna be able to find
a goddamn frog person, okay?

286
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,662
- I'm gonna find him.
- Guys, please. Just let me handle it.

287
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:53,727
I got it.

288
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,296
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

289
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,865
I'm Dr. Coleman.
How can I help you today?

290
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,936
Yes. Do you have some sort
of donkey-brain database?

291
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:04,380
- No.
- I'm looking for a kid... the frog kid.

292
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,283
Just search for any half-man,
half-amphibious creature.

293
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:09,685
Yeah, okay, no. That's not why we're here.

294
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:14,249
Doctor, I've always
relied upon the kindness of strangers.

295
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,852
What are you do...
What is that, <i>A Streetcar Named Desire?</i>

296
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:19,363
I'm in desperate need
of medical intervention.

297
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,923
You see, years ago...

298
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:26,267
I tried to burn my college roommate down
to the box springs...

299
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,966
whilst she was sleeping.

300
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,667
And now...

301
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:33,269
I have a hankering to do it again.

302
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,782
- Dr. Zimmerman!
- Excuse me?

303
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:41,616
Dr. Albert Zimmerman...
the old bastard who ran the nitwit farm.

304
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,247
He'll know where Froggy is.
I'll find him. Yeah.

305
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,416
- I'll find the frog kid.
- Yeah, go find him.

306
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:50,588
- I'm gonna find him. - Uh, I'm not
sure I understand what's happening.

307
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,631
- I'm schizophrenic.
- Dee?

308
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:55,030
I swear you would be of more use to me...

309
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,569
if I skinned you and turned your skin
into a lampshade.

310
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:00,265
Or fashioned you into a piece
of high-end luggage.

311
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,136
I can even add you to my collection.

312
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,669
Are you saying that you have a collection
of skin luggage?

313
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,406
Of course I'm not, Dee. Don't be ridiculous.

314
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,472
Think of the smell.
You haven't thought of the smell, you bitch!

315
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,414
Now you say another word...

316
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:17,218
and I swear to God I will dice you into
a million little pieces.

317
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,554
And put those pieces in a box...

318
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,422
a glass box...

319
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,860
that I will display on my mantel.

320
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,164
All right.

321
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:31,601
Now that that's settled,
we can have a normal conversation.

322
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,571
Now, Doctor, I'm here
to talk to you about a man...

323
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,405
a very dangerous and a very unstable man.

324
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:44,113
Dr. Zimmerman?

325
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,351
- Yeah?
- It's me.

326
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:54,217
Don't you recognize me?

327
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:56,386
Yes. Yes.

328
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,987
Of course I recognize you.

329
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:01,693
Good, 'cause I got questions.

330
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,133
What did you do with him? Where is he?

331
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:07,639
- Where is whom?
- The frog kid.

332
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:08,765
Froggy!

333
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:12,709
Oh, God, <i>Doc.</i> I got to find him.

334
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:15,542
But I don't understand.

335
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,048
I got to know where he is, Doc,
because I got to help him.

336
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,347
I-I owe him that much!

337
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,046
But, Franklin...

338
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,418
Yes?

339
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,917
<i>You</i> are Froggy.

340
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,824
Huh?

341
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,486
<i>I pledge allegiance...</i>

342
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,394
<i>to the flag
of the United States of America...</i>

343
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,194
<i>It was you, Frank.</i>

344
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,530
<i>You are the frog kid.</i>

345
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,831
<i>You were an outcast as a child...</i>

346
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:46,366
<i>so you created an imaginary friend.</i>

347
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:49,573
It's okay, Froggy. I'll keep you moist.

348
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:53,243
<i>But the lines of reality became blurred.</i>

349
00:17:55,054 --> 00:18:00,959
<i>Soon you didn't know
where Frank began and Froggy ended.</i>

350
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,889
Oh, yeah. I see that.

351
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,593
I remember that now.

352
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,369
What are you doing?

353
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,166
You're having an episode again, Frank,
aren't you?

354
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,507
We've got to catch the little froggy.

355
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,773
Put that down. Get out of here.

356
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:25,305
- Here we go. Come on.
- I'm not sick anymore. I'm not a frog.

357
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,716
- I know I'm not a frog!
- Catch the froggy!

358
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,652
We have to catch the froggy.

359
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,457
Let's go through the... through the...
through the... the checklist.

360
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,259
- Um, crucifix.
- I got it.

361
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,026
Got that. Holy water. We got that.

362
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,534
We got all the stuff.
We got the straps. We got everything, man.

363
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,092
- Okay.
- So, what's the plan?

364
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,866
We're gonna, like,
bum-rush this guy from behind?

365
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:50,375
Whoa, whoa. Guys, come on.
No one is taking me from behind, all right?

366
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:53,276
Unless you have crack.
If you have crack, let's boogie.

367
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,643
No one is going into your asshole.

368
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,409
I wouldn't let them without the crack.

369
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,849
Can we just...
Let's go through the basic beats, all right?

370
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,979
- Uh, talk a bunch of Latin.
- Yeah, that's me. I'll fake it.

371
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,716
Wait. What do you mean, you'll fake it?

372
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,280
You don't know your Latin anymore?

373
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,223
Don't worry about it.
I can sell anything, you know?

374
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,091
You know how many times
I fake on the streets?

375
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,630
You know? You have to fake.

376
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,360
The guys that don't fake,
they're the ones that get it the worst.

377
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,130
Cricket, just, like, anything we can do
to have you not talk about...

378
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:21,196
like, sucking penises
or getting raped in the butt?

379
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:23,207
It just keeps popping up.

380
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,766
Oh! Oh! Hey, I got it.

381
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:28,643
Problem solved. I got Pete's drugs.

382
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:30,807
Oh, we got drugs?
All right, crank me up, baby!

383
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:32,646
We going up? Down?
How we doing this, huh?

384
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,481
Cricket! Ugh!

385
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:37,351
- Oh, the face? Yeah, sorry.
- Jesus Christ! That is gross, man.

386
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,015
- What the hell?
- God's wrath.

387
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,685
He had some sort of Thanksgiving incident.
He went to some party...

388
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
Yeah, at your house! Everyone was there.
How do you not remember this?

389
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:45,829
No, you were not at our place...

390
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,832
'cause we would not have invited you
to our Thanksgiving thing.

391
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,801
- Never mind. Doesn't matter.
- How the hell did you get drugs for Pete?

392
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,101
Well, I had a simple conversation
with a reasonable man...

393
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,902
and that man wrote me a prescription.

394
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:59,001
Mmm, yeah. He got the drugs
by being a real-life, actual psychopath.

395
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:01,069
She keeps... Uh, no.

396
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,808
Ridiculous, okay?
No, the man asked me a few questions.

397
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:06,351
- Mm-hmm. - I answered those
questions as honestly as I could.

398
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,181
- Right.
- Next thing I know, I'm walking out the door...

399
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,381
- with meds for borderline personality disorder.
- Yup.

400
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:13,721
- That's how you get shit done.
- No, no. That's how you get diagnosed.

401
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,919
Where is he? Where's Pete?

402
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm gonna put him out of his misery!

403
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,492
No, Frank!
We're gonna help this guy, all right?

404
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,500
But there's no helping him, Dennis.
Don't you understand?

405
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:25,059
I know. I'm the frog kid, right?

406
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,697
It was all in my mind, but I got cured.

407
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,502
But I could have another episode.

408
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:32,874
If I had another episode, what do I do?
I eat a couple of flies.

409
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,175
If he has another episode, he kills us.

410
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,010
- He's a murderer.
- Dude, dude.

411
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:39,744
No, I'm not. Huh?

412
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,376
I'm-I'm not a murderer.

413
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,353
That's just what a murderer would say.

414
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,083
No, no, no, really.
All that stuff with my family...

415
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,751
it's just... it's just a rumor
people started about me.

416
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,454
You know, kind of like all the rumors
you guys started about me?

417
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,429
- What rumors? What are you talking about?
- Huh?

418
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,693
You know, that I'm crazy and stuff.

419
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,292
- Well, yeah, uh, crazy awesome, you know.
- Like crazy bad-ass!

420
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,132
Yeah, except-except none of it was true...

421
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:01,001
and then the more people spread it around...

422
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,768
the more afraid people were of me.

423
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,935
Well, wait a second. Then why did you get
sent to a mental institution?

424
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,208
Social anxiety disorder
mixed with depression.

425
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,841
I was really more of a danger to myself.

426
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,112
I was always talking
about committing suicide.

427
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,177
- Ooh.
- Oh.

428
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:18,450
That's why I wanted
to reconnect with you guys...

429
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:21,118
'cause a lot of people,
they can't deal with that kind of stuff...

430
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:24,822
but you always liked me, so I figured
you guys could help me cope with it.

431
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,489
That we would help...

432
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:29,090
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

433
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,432
Well, we could help you cope with it. Um...

434
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,664
- Or...
- Hmm?

435
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:46,442
This thing's going all the way to
Los Angeles, buddy, all right?

436
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:49,419
- City of Angels!
- Yeah, a place where no one is depressed.

437
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:51,115
You can surf the sadness away.

438
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,851
This is exactly what you need, Pete.

439
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,893
I want to thank you guys
for trying to help me.

440
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,224
- Suppose it could be good to get a fresh start.
- Yeah, all that.

441
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,093
Save the chitchat for the hoboes.

442
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:01,029
- You got a long trip.
- Get on the train!

443
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,698
Bon voyage. All right.

444
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,637
That takes care of that. Problem solved.

445
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,834
All right. Well, uh, you guys want to go
pop by the new Eagles facility?

446
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,501
- Ooh.
- Heard they're having an open practice.

447
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,308
- Yeah!
- Let's go, Eagles!

448
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,746
- Let's go, Birds!
- Ride that train!

449
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,646
