1
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:04,625
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with us.

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:06,928
- Yes, this shouldn't take long.
- So...

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,318
You'd like to buy a boat.

4
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:12,362
Yes, we have recently come into
a considerable amount of money.

5
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:14,771
Now I'm not gonna bore you with details,
but let's just say

6
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,486
that my friends here
set up for a *** adventure...

7
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:18,699
- ***.com.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,006
- Actually we're not supposed to talk about...
- That's true but...

9
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:24,224
Yeah, technically we're doing a couple
of things in the hush hush from Uncle Sam...

10
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:28,345
The point is we're flush.
We are 25 hundred dollars flush.

11
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:29,471
So don't worry about that.

12
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:32,323
So we'd like to take some of that money
and taste a bit of the high life.

13
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,377
We've also talked to our friend here

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,983
into throwing
his entire life savings into the venture.

15
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:36,769
That's right.

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,806
You see, I'm in it for the lifestyle
as well as the great investment.

17
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,575
Okay, well, then what is it
you guys are looking for?

18
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:43,810
Let's talk needs, please?

19
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,378
I'd like to talk needs first.

20
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,980
Now I have the need for speed.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,749
It's very important, it's inherent,
there's nothing I can do about it.

22
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:50,783
So speed is a must.

23
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,286
Absolutely, but we are also
looking to entertain guests upon

24
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,522
this boat, so...
Yeah, we're gonna throw some

25
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,524
P. Diddy-style parties
up on the deck.

26
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,959
Um, can we talk
shrimp for a minute?

27
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:04,030
I'd like the boat to be able to haul
in a tremendous amount of shrimp.

28
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:07,000
Sort of a Forrest Gump-size
amount of shrimp.

29
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,502
Um, you should be writing
this down, I think.

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,371
Why are you not
writing this down?

31
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,293
Oh, let me just see
if I have this right here.

32
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:15,953
Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

33
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:18,858
It seems what you guys are
looking for is some sort of

34
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,480
P. Diddy-style shrimping vessel.

35
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,147
All right!

36
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:21,814
That's it!

37
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,050
You're a really good listener,
and I didn't peg you

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,186
for one when I walked in here 'cause
of the pinky ring, but that's great.

39
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,557
You know, I've got just the boat for you.

40
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,892
Well, here she is, The
Drowning Sailor.

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,030
It, uh, doesn't meet, well,
uh, any of your specs.

42
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,198
Look, I'm gonna level
with you, pal.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,234
We... we saw this coming a mile

44
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,836
away, and we've had our hearts
set on this boat thing for

45
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,907
days now, which, in our world,
is a level of focus in which

46
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,133
I personally have
never experienced.

47
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,413
But I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and I'm gonna say... We'll take it!

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,080
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:54,814
What-what-what are you doing?

50
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:55,481
I was-I was doing a thing.

51
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,916
You were taking a
long time, dude.

52
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,351
You're taking way too long.

53
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,018
We wanted to buy a boat.

54
00:01:59,086 --> 00:01:59,686
Let's get the boat.

55
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,087
I was taking a little while
because I was doing a little

56
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,488
presentation...
Dennis, what if someone walks

57
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,823
down the deck and makes
an offer before us?

58
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,925
Nobody's gonna make an offer
before I finish my thing.

59
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:06,593
They might have.

60
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,795
We're not the only people in town that want...
I'm confused.

61
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,396
Are you gonna take
the boat or not?

62
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,531
Yes, we're taking the boat.

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,332
We're buying the boat.

64
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,267
We want to add a little
fanfare into the situation.

65
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,002
My friends here, they
couldn't wait for that.

66
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,805
Yes, we're-we're
taking the boat.

67
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,011
What a score!

68
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,678
Yeah!

69
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:55,347
Houseboat, huh?

70
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,282
Yeah, absolutely...
Well, the houseboat offers all

71
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,784
the advantages of a house, but
with the excitement of the sea.

72
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,786
Think of all the fish
we're gonna catch.

73
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,154
It's not just fish, Frank.

74
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:04,522
You gotta start thinking
about shrimp, okay?

75
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,256
Oh-oh-oh.

76
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,625
We're gonna be hauling in so
much shrimp every day, it's

77
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,027
gonna pay for itself ten times over.

78
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:11,183
Picture tiny shrimp crawling
all over this boat.

79
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,210
- Every inch of it...
- Guys...

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,123
Can we not focus on the shrimp
cause we have so much work to do.

81
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:15,972
It's a shrimp boat.

82
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,473
I'd like to have at least one
conversation about shrimp.

83
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,509
No. No, shrimp is a very
small aspect of the whole...

84
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,644
Most important part of the...
No, you know what?

85
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:22,311
I'll tell you what.

86
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,746
Shrimp or no shrimp, I'm
very excited about it.

87
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:24,413
Yeah.

88
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,749
And I say we take this little
lady onto the sea and get loaded.

89
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,117
Well, slow your roll there, Dee.

90
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:30,353
The lady's not quite ready
to go out to the sea yet.

91
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,655
There's a lot of prep work
that still has to be done.

92
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:35,191
So, actually, Frank and Charlie,
I want you to start by scraping

93
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,460
the barnacles off the bottom of
the boat, 'cause that probably

94
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:40,396
hasn't been done in years,
while Dee and Mac and I go in

95
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:43,278
to the inside and check out the
decor situation, you know?

96
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:45,568
One word.

97
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:46,235
Shrimp.

98
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:48,471
Okay, yeah.

99
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:51,741
No, just as I suspected, we got
our work cut out for us, guys.

100
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,609
This isn't Diddyesque at all.

101
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,245
No, no, we gotta get
rid of all this shit.

102
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:57,914
Are you guys crazy?

103
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:58,981
This boat is awesome.

104
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,850
How about a little of this?

105
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:07,924
Huh?

106
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,660
What the hell is that?

107
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,328
This?

108
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:13,529
That's my P. Diddy boat dance.

109
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:14,197
Uh!

110
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:17,600
You look like one of this inflatable
dancing things at the used car lot.

111
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,202
The ones that flail
around in the wind.

112
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,102
No, I don't.

113
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,803
I look good.

114
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:22,572
No, Dee, that's exactly
what you look like.

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,240
I promise you that's
what you look like.

116
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:25,141
You can't dance for shit!

117
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:27,376
I can dance, and you don't know
what you're talking about.

118
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:28,845
I'm gonna bring one of those
in so you can see it.

119
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:31,514
Okay, why don't you bring the guy
in, we'll have a dance competition?

120
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:33,216
I'm gonna be the judge
of that contest!

121
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:33,883
I'm gonna show...!

122
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:35,351
There's not gonna be a contest!

123
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,619
Stop! Everybody stop! Shut up!

124
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,788
No, nobody's bringing any trashy
inflatable man on this boat.

125
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:39,455
Absolutely not.

126
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:40,122
Dee, stop dancing.

127
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:41,791
You look like an asshole.

128
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:42,859
We're not there yet.

129
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:44,961
We have a lot of work to do first.

130
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:47,096
Okay, Dee, since you didn't
invest any money in this

131
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:50,132
venture, you're gonna be the one that's
got to do all the hard labor here.

132
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,102
So I need you to get rid of all
this shit, and make the boat

133
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,769
look nice, okay?

134
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:54,437
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

135
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,104
Hard work?

136
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,372
What are you talking about?

137
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,441
Work first, and then you can
do your weird inflatable

138
00:04:58,508 --> 00:04:59,909
tube-man P. Diddy dance.

139
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,210
Or whatever it is.

140
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,213
You know what I'm looking forward to?

141
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,948
Is catching me some
Delaware River catfish.

142
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:06,616
Oh, yeah!

143
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:07,750
They are so tasty!

144
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,752
I used to eat 'em when I was a kid.

145
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,821
You can't buy 'em in
the stores no more.

146
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:12,788
Why is that?

147
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,689
The goddamned EPA.

148
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:14,590
They says they're toxic.

149
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:15,992
Toxic my ass.

150
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:17,326
I mean, they're just endangered.

151
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:18,527
They're tasty, man.

152
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:21,797
Frank. this boat is the best
investment I ever made, man.

153
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:22,665
I mean, it's huge!

154
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:26,769
We're gonna pop over to the boat store
real quick and grab some, uh...

155
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:28,921
Whoa!
What the hell are you guys doing?

156
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,156
- We're loading our gear.
- No, no, no. You should not be loading.

157
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,676
No one should be bringing
anything onto the boat.

158
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:35,077
You should be scraping, okay?

159
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:35,745
Yes.

160
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:36,379
So, scrape.

161
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:38,614
Oh, well, we're gonna scrape the boat.

162
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:40,216
We are gonna scrape the boat.

163
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,517
Are you patronizing me?

164
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:42,485
Don't patronize me.

165
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:43,386
Don't do that.

166
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:44,954
No one's patronizing you, all right?

167
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:45,755
Here's what we'll do:

168
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,723
we'll scrape all these little
delicious oysters or whatever

169
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,624
off the side of the boat.

170
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,893
We'll put 'em in a pot, we'll boil
'em up for before you get back.

171
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:52,328
We'll cook 'em for you.

172
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:52,995
There you go.

173
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:54,330
No, those are barnacles.

174
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,164
Do not eat those.

175
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,333
Do not cook them in a pot
and serve them to us.

176
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay, all that.

177
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,468
Honestly, don't eat those.

178
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:00,870
You'll get very, very sick, okay?

179
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:01,537
Yeah.

180
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:02,939
Now that is a direct
order from your captain.

181
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:04,340
Whoa!
Since when are you the captain?

182
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:05,708
Well, clearly I'm the captain.

183
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:06,842
Who else would be the captain.

184
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,411
I feel like I would be the captain.

185
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,078
Dennis?

186
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:09,879
I don't give a shit.

187
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:10,813
I'm captain! I call it!

188
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:11,480
Locked in. Boom.

189
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:12,148
Scrape. Let's go.

190
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:13,950
Let's go. Let's go.

191
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:15,284
I ain't scraping shit.

192
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:16,652
No, we're not scraping!

193
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,320
No, no scraping.

194
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:18,621
Here's what we're gonna do.

195
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,056
We're gonna fire up the boat, right?

196
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:20,723
Yeah.

197
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,825
We're gonna take it out on
the ocean, we're gonna get

198
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:23,492
some oysters. And shrimp.

199
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,160
And shrimpies!

200
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,329
Toss me the keys.

201
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:29,265
Here you go.

202
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,133
What the hell was that?

203
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,234
Well, it's the keys.

204
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:33,369
I threw 'em right at ya.

205
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:34,704
I asked you to toss 'em!

206
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:35,371
You threw 'em overhand!

207
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,739
That's the way I throw!

208
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:38,074
Jump in there and get 'em.

209
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:39,442
I'm not going in there.

210
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:40,109
I don't sink.

211
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:40,776
What?

212
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:43,245
I get in there, I just bob
around like a cauliflower.

213
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:44,613
Don't give me lines, man.

214
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,615
Jump in the ocean and
get the damn keys!

215
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:47,616
No, I'm not going in.

216
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:49,652
Charlie, I'm not going in.

217
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,454
It's your boat. You go on in.

218
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:52,855
You son of a bitch.

219
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,857
All right.

220
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:03,962
Yo.

221
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:04,862
Hey, buddy.

222
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,299
Uh, I got us some turpentine, some
wax and some high-gloss boat paint.

223
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,634
This shit is really expensive.

224
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:10,768
Oh, dude, you're telling me.

225
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:13,104
I picked us up some new slacks
and docksiders so we could have

226
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:15,139
the right look, you know,
and fit in and everything.

227
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,675
We're running pretty low on
remaining dick towel money though.

228
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:20,144
Plus, we got to fill that thing
up with gas, and... I know, man.

229
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:22,080
We got to pop by the department
store, pick up the mattress.

230
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,081
I want to get a nice one, too.

231
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:23,848
You know what I'm saying?

232
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:24,983
The what? The mattress?

233
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,883
What do we need a mattress for?

234
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,019
What do you mean what do
we need a mattress for?

235
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:31,089
Why in the hell do you think we just
spent all that money on a boat?

236
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:32,890
The whole purpose of buying the
boat in the first place was to

237
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,727
get the ladies nice and tipsy
topside, so we can take them to

238
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:39,397
a nice comfortable place below deck
and, you know, they can't refuse.

239
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:42,233
Because of the implication.

240
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,314
Oh. Uh, okay.

241
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,382
You had me going for the first part,

242
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,127
but the second half kind of threw me.

243
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:49,140
Well, dude, dude, think about it.

244
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,943
She's out in the middle of nowhere
with some dude she barely knows.

245
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:53,511
She looks around and
what does she see?

246
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,579
Nothing but open ocean.

247
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,414
"Ah, there's nowhere for me to run.

248
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,534
What am I going to do, say no?"

249
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,067
Okay.

250
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,754
That seems really dark.

251
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:03,655
No, it's not dark.

252
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:04,722
You're misunderstanding me, bro.

253
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,423
I think I am.

254
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:06,157
Yeah, you are.

255
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,326
Because if the girl said no,
then the answer obviously is no.

256
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:08,993
No.

257
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,528
But the thing is, she's
not going to say no.

258
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:13,665
She would never say no,
because of the implication.

259
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:18,936
Now... you said that word
"implication" a couple of times.

260
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,471
What... what implication?

261
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,241
The implication that things
might go wrong for her if she

262
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:24,742
refuses to sleep with me.

263
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,278
You know, not that things are
going to go wrong for her, but

264
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,546
she's thinking that they will.

265
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:31,282
But it sounds like she doesn't
want to have sex with you.

266
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,750
Why aren't you understanding this?

267
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:35,119
I don't... She doesn't know whether
she wants to have sex with me.

268
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:35,787
She doesn't know?

269
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:36,454
That's not the issue.

270
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:37,188
Are you going to hurt women?

271
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:38,556
I'm not going to hurt these women.

272
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:39,223
Oh, okay.

273
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,558
Why would I ever hurt these women?

274
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:41,225
I don't know.

275
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,727
I feel like you're not
getting this at all.

276
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:43,695
I'm not getting it.

277
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,096
Goddamn.

278
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,064
Don't you look at me like that.

279
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:47,932
You certainly wouldn't
be in any danger.

280
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,666
So they are in danger?

281
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:49,667
No one's in any danger.

282
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:51,636
How can I make that any
more clear to you?

283
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,771
Okay, it's an implication of danger.

284
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,839
You know what, just drop it.

285
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:55,940
Let's drop it.

286
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:58,843
Buy your shit and let's
get out of here.

287
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:04,197
Oh, Charlie.

288
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:05,231
Charlie, you got 'em?

289
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,365
No keys. Can't find 'em.

290
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,300
What?!

291
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,468
I found a couple cool things.

292
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:10,336
What?

293
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:11,737
I got a tooth.

294
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:13,206
Ooh, look at that.

295
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,585
- It's like a horse's tooth or something.
- Oh, yeah.

296
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:17,320
- And look at this ***.
- Uh.

297
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:18,867
This is a war relic.

298
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:20,513
This could be valuable.

299
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,915
What the hell happened down there?

300
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:23,983
Some kind of horse massacre?

301
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:25,251
Could be.

302
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,285
Could be, right?

303
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:26,953
Yeah.

304
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,621
Dude, there's so much cool shit
down there, I'm gonna keep

305
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:29,622
diving looking for it.

306
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,624
I need a flashlight 'cause it's dark.

307
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:32,692
Flashlight coming up.

308
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,927
Just toss it to me real quick.

309
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:36,295
Come on, man.

310
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,930
I throw overhand, Charlie.

311
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:39,765
Ooh!

312
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:45,338
♪ Stop Drop Shut 'em
down, open up shop... ♪

313
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,506
What the hell are you doing in here?

314
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:50,276
Just throwing all these old,
like, dolls and compasses and

315
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,445
hairbrushes and shit overboard.

316
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,413
Mac and Dennis are making me clean up.

317
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:57,550
Well, this is a shit hole, isn't it?

318
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:58,751
Yeah.

319
00:09:58,819 --> 00:09:59,885
Maybe we should gut it.

320
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:00,820
All right.

321
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:04,290
Let's see...
Ooh, ah, here we go.

322
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,124
Now, let's see.

323
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:08,594
Start with this beautiful baby here.

324
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,062
Whoa.

325
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,697
Crash and burn.

326
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:15,201
Holy mackerel.

327
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:17,703
Die, you sucker!

328
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:20,373
Oh, baby, look out.

329
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:25,044
Whoa! That ain't good.

330
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:28,781
♪ Give a dog a bone
Leave a dog alone... ♪

331
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:31,150
Whoa, Christ.

332
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,886
Think about, like, all the
movies and the books and all

333
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:36,789
the stories of all the
terrible awful, awful things

334
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:38,858
that have happened out in
the middle of the ocean.

335
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,793
You know, that's the stuff
that's, like, rattling around in

336
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,896
her head, informing her decision as
to whether she sleeps with me or not.

337
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:44,764
That's all I'm saying.

338
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,966
It's not like a big thing, or...
Uh-huh.

339
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,268
Look, I need you to
understand this, okay?

340
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,904
You're making it seem like I'm
some sort of monster or something.

341
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:52,772
Yeah, okay.

342
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,707
Hey, wha...
what is going on in there?

343
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:55,408
Like this?

344
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,876
It's more like a rolling sway.

345
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:57,610
Like this. There you go.

346
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:59,245
What the hell are you
guys doing in here?

347
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:01,781
Oh, my God, what the hell
did you do to our boat?!

348
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:02,748
Uh, we were cleaning it.

349
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,351
Wow, wow, wow, what's that all about?

350
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,420
You're just breaking
everything in this boat.

351
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:09,855
You were supposed to be fixing
it up and making it look nice.

352
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:12,091
Crew meeting! Crew meeting!

353
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,092
Where is Charlie?

354
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,893
He's in the water.

355
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,595
What is he doing in the water?

356
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,464
Charlie.

357
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,399
Aw, dude, what are you doing?

358
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,801
Oh, hey, guys, come here.

359
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:24,470
You are not going to believe how
much cool shit is under the boat.

360
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,405
There's like a whole
world of ancient stuff.

361
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,140
There was a horse massacre,
right, in the Revolutionary

362
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,975
times, and then there's
like a pirate ship.

363
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:32,311
Like, I found all these
old pretty little dolls.

364
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:35,427
- No. - Maybe like a brush, like
a pirate is brushing his hair...

365
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:37,093
Killed the horse and
then jumped in the ocean?

366
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,285
Goddamn it, I've been cleaning
up in there for hours

367
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:42,555
throwing this shit overboard and
you're just dragging it all back up.

368
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:44,390
You've been dumping the
trash in the ocean?

369
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,926
Why-why-why are you swimming in
the water in the first place?

370
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,527
He dropped the keys in the water.

371
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:51,630
I did not... All right, first of all,
he threw the keys at me overhand.

372
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:52,798
You should have seen this throw.

373
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,134
We leave you guys alone for 45
minutes and you destroy the

374
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:58,471
interior of the boat, you lose the keys...
I can get those keys.

375
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:00,706
I just need you guys to buy me
some scuba equipment so I can

376
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:01,841
stay down there longer.

377
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,876
Do you realize how much money
scuba equipment costs?

378
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:04,910
No. Rent the cheap stuff.

379
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:06,679
Just rent some cheap stuff, all right?

380
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:09,315
In the meantime, we'll clear all
this stuff off... we'll start

381
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:10,483
to paint, all right?

382
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,520
By the time you guys come back,
I promise you, I promise, the

383
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,922
boat will be looking better.

384
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,290
I can't tell.

385
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,225
Is he patronizing me again?

386
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,793
I can't...
I can't even tell anymore.

387
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:23,195
No, no, what he's saying is
really stupid, but it's sincere,

388
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,597
okay? It's sincere this time.

389
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,499
I think you're just a
little sensitive to it.

390
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:27,233
Sorry, Charlie.

391
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,701
I'm sorry, too.

392
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:29,568
That was patronizing!

393
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:31,203
You can't patronize your captain.

394
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,205
That's a sea law.

395
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:39,745
Yo, dude.

396
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,081
You realize how much
boating equipment costs?

397
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,816
It's crazy, it's astronomical.

398
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:46,218
I can't believe how much
they charge for this shit.

399
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:49,355
You know, Dee, Frank and
Charlie are driving me crazy.

400
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,424
We're spending all of our dick
towel money and they're throwing

401
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,627
keys into the water and losing everything...
And you're not even listening to me.

402
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:55,294
No, I heard you.

403
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:56,629
You said a bunch of words, right?

404
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:57,363
Look at this.

405
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,197
What is that?

406
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:00,366
It's like some kind of
dock party mixer, dude.

407
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:01,033
It's a flyer.

408
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:01,901
Look at these chicks.

409
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:02,568
And an anchor.

410
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:04,336
Dude, that's what we need to be doing.

411
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,138
We need to be mixing it up at
mixers with other boat people

412
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:07,206
and living the lifestyle.

413
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:07,873
You're right.

414
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:08,541
Okay, cool.

415
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:10,242
And then we'll be back
in the high life again.

416
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,910
Yeah.

417
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:11,610
Like Stevie Nicks.

418
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,446
That's actually Steve Winwood.

419
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:14,747
Right. Same dude, right?

420
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,382
It's not the same dude.

421
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,716
Actually, one's not even a dude.

422
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,018
Are you sure?

423
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:20,152
Yeah, I'm sure.

424
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,853
It doesn't matter.

425
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:21,520
I love that song.

426
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,354
Let's buy that CD.

427
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,223
Well, first of all, I
love that song, too.

428
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,291
That's why I already own the CD.

429
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,992
I own all of Steve Winwood's shit.

430
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,827
You should know this.

431
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,795
And secondly, we have not been
on the same page all day.

432
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,331
We can't be spending money
on CDs that I already own.

433
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,433
We're spending too
much money as it is.

434
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:38,404
It's bad enough I let you buy that
stupid inflatable guy from the car lot.

435
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,308
Stop it!

436
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,009
Stop it!

437
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:45,411
Goddamn it, don't!

438
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,413
It's not the puffy
guy... it's this music.

439
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,734
This aggressive music you're playing.

440
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:53,153
- This is not...
- It's got nothing to do with the music.

441
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:54,101
Listen to me.

442
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,221
Listen to me!

443
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,121
I'm turning you off.

444
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:56,822
You're crazy.

445
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,791
Riled you up.

446
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,594
Yo, you guys...
Look at you... fighting with a green guy.

447
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,529
Dudes, you're never going to
believe what I just found

448
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:05,130
floating off the end of the boat.

449
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:07,399
Okay, I'm scraping those little delicious
oysters off the bottom, right?

450
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,868
Why is this turned off?

451
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:09,668
You're back.

452
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:12,471
You don't even... Well, well, I got
to say, guys, I'm very impressed.

453
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,939
The boat's really
starting to come along.

454
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,674
I didn't think you guys had it in you.

455
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:16,408
Yeah.

456
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,911
There's a couple more brushes
here and a little paint.

457
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:21,647
Get to work, we'll do the
trim and then we'll be done.

458
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:22,314
Us?

459
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,349
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

460
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,050
We're not going to be
doing any of that.

461
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:25,918
No, no, no.

462
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:27,386
You're not going to
be doing any of that?

463
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:28,053
What do you mean?

464
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,488
We're not going to be
doing any of the work.

465
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:31,023
That's-that's what you guys are doing.

466
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:31,824
That was the whole deal.

467
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,492
No, we got a party to get ready for.

468
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,695
Yeah, so... We're going to do all the
work while you guys go to a party?

469
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:37,596
We got to socialize.

470
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:38,297
Yeah.

471
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:39,031
I could socialize.

472
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:40,566
Uh, no.
Not looking like you're looking.

473
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:43,102
You're covered in paint and dirt and
grime and all kinds of shit, so...

474
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:45,204
You're skin looks like leather and
you got blisters all over you.

475
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:46,539
You guys look absolutely terrible.

476
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,607
Well...
Well, we're out of here.

477
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:52,177
So, Charlie, there's your,
uh, there's your scuba gear.

478
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:53,412
Find the keys.

479
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,147
Just find 'em.

480
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:57,550
Oh, guys... keep up the good work.

481
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:59,618
See, now they flipped it around.

482
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:01,253
They're patronizing us.

483
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:02,655
Absolutely patronizing us, Frank.

484
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,957
That's right, they're patronizing...
But don't take it to heart,

485
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:06,659
buddy, 'cause I got something
that's going to cheer you up.

486
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:07,326
What?

487
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:07,993
Guess who found the keys.

488
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:08,661
The keys!

489
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:09,328
You found the keys!

490
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,729
Dude, they were just
floating under the boat.

491
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,097
They got a little
floaty thing on them.

492
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:13,532
This is amazing, by the
way... these floaty things.

493
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,094
We should patent this.

494
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:21,551
Okay, I think this is it.

495
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,007
Now this is much more our speed.

496
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:24,952
These are the kind of people
we should be hanging out with.

497
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,443
Man, now this is a boat.

498
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:28,579
Ahoy, ahoy.

499
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:29,880
Hi, hi.

500
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,015
A couple of fellow yachters.

501
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:35,085
Saw your flyer at the boat store...
Oh.

502
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:37,047
Do we have the wrong yacht?

503
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,048
No, no, no, no, come on
in and grab a drink.

504
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,535
We're just getting warmed up.

505
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:41,922
Okay.

506
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:42,656
Sure.

507
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:45,279
Let's just...
Yeah.

508
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,729
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

509
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:50,664
Yeah.

510
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:52,632
Um, this isn't the
crowd I was expecting.

511
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,535
These guys are more barnacle covered
and sunburned than Dee and Frank.

512
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,471
Let's not rush to judgment, okay?

513
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:58,872
These are real men of the sea.

514
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,074
Maybe this whole thing
isn't about meeting girls.

515
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:04,344
Maybe it's about having an adventure,
you know, an open ocean adventure.

516
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:05,545
Take a look at this guy.

517
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:06,947
How'd he lose that hand?

518
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:10,517
I bet you it was some kind
of crazy adventure, right?

519
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,911
Let's find out.

520
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:19,018
Hey, bro, how'd you lose that hand?

521
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,554
Diabetes.

522
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,188
Oh.

523
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:29,109
Um, that's not, uh, much
of an adventure, is it?

524
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,363
Kind of tragic.

525
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,633
Yeah.

526
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:38,137
You know, we'll let you get back to...
We're just going to go over to

527
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:39,204
the bar and grab a drink.

528
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:42,007
I'd offer to pour you a drink,
but you probably can't drink

529
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:45,244
though with the...
diabetes.

530
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,880
Diabetes.

531
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:49,949
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,821
Look, you know what,
I was wrong, dude.

533
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,722
This is a bummer.

534
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,023
Yeah, this is a major bummer.

535
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,091
Let's get the hell out of here.

536
00:16:59,159 --> 00:16:59,758
What do you say?

537
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,426
Yeah.

538
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,294
Hey, listen, guys,
thanks for everything.

539
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:04,029
I think we're just going
to take off, though.

540
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:05,731
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

541
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,166
We're just getting warmed up.

542
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,468
We're going to set sail soon, and
we're going to have a couple

543
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:10,936
of tasty treats out there.

544
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,571
It's going to get nuts out
there, fellas, right?

545
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,742
We're going to be out
on open ocean, right?

546
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,744
Huh?

547
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,913
Anything can happen out there.

548
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:24,149
No laws, right, boys?

549
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:28,079
Just us and our tasty treats.

550
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:33,266
- That was an implication, right?
- That was definitely the implication.

551
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,126
Tasty treats?

552
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:34,827
Are we the tasty treats?

553
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,362
We're the tasty treats
in the scenario.

554
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:37,129
Yes, we're the tasty treats.

555
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:38,731
They're going to take us out
into the open ocean... they're

556
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:39,635
going to have their way with us, Mac.

557
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:40,620
We got to get the hell out of here.

558
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,111
Is this how you wanted
those poor women to feel?

559
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,485
No. You know what, I don't enjoy
having this conversation with you.

560
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,160
I feel like you're
lumping me in with them.

561
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,922
Now, gentlemen, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

562
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:52,211
The ladies have arrived.

563
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:59,218
♪ I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time

564
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:06,058
♪ Will open up again I'll be
back in the high life again... ♪

565
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,827
Oh, Frank, you are absolutely right.

566
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,162
This is boat music.

567
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,165
Yeah, this is the kind of
music you ought to listen to.

568
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:16,402
I am learning some amazing
moves from this guy.

569
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:18,971
Yeah, you're doing great.

570
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,472
You got the moves.

571
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,574
Anybody want any more catfish?

572
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,477
Yo, dude, definitely give
me another one of those.

573
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:26,445
They're delicious.

574
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,881
And you can taste that
sort of endangered tang.

575
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:29,521
That's it.

576
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,548
Oh, hold on.

577
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,851
I'm getting a call.

578
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:33,886
Hello.

579
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:36,588
Hey, hey, Charlie, did you
guys ever find those keys?

580
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:37,923
Yeah, man, I did actually.

581
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,692
I did. Can you believe that.

582
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,726
Okay, great.

583
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,028
I need you to grab Frank and Dee
and get the hell out of there

584
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,164
because we're going to be
bringing back a couple of tasty

585
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:47,199
treats, if you know what I'm saying.

586
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:48,567
Hey, man, yeah, absolutely.

587
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,803
I'll get right on that.

588
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,005
That's how you patronize
someone right there.

589
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:54,606
What, what, what, what, what, what?

590
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,307
Dennis being a dick.

591
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,141
Don't worry about it, man.

592
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,077
Hey, this scuba equipment's broken.

593
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:58,911
It's useless.

594
00:18:58,978 --> 00:18:59,945
The hell with it.

595
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,779
Let's get back to shrimping.

596
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:01,814
I'm gonna toss this shit.

597
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,882
It's crap anyway.

598
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:08,887
Ooh, that's not good.

599
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:13,592
Uh, hey, um, what do you
do if the boat is on fire?

600
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
What do you mean?

601
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,261
The boat is on fire.

602
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:16,929
What?

603
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:17,796
Oh, fire's getting bigger.

604
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:18,664
What?!

605
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:19,364
Fire's getting bigger.

606
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:20,032
Go!

607
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,699
Fire's getting big.

608
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:21,433
Bail!

609
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:22,301
Holy shit!

610
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:23,068
Find some water.

611
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:23,769
Find some water?!

612
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:24,737
Find some water.

613
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,205
What do you mean find some water?

614
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:27,372
There's water everywhere.

615
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,407
Help!

616
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,409
Help us.

617
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:37,449
I cannot wait to get you
ladies out into the sea.

618
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:40,052
It's so much more romantic in
the middle of nowhere where we

619
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,895
can be completely alone, and you can
make rash decisions based on fear.

620
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:46,425
Right, Dennis?

621
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:48,920
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,563
Oh, wow, whoa, whoa.

623
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,033
I thought we told you guys to beat it.

624
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,401
Out of my way.

625
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:58,036
No more Diddy boat.

626
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:02,107
Damn catfish nipping at my heels all the w...
Endangered my ass.

627
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,276
There's a billion of them out there.

628
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:05,511
Ugh. What the hell happened?

629
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,713
That was a hell of a swim.

630
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:08,914
Charlie, where's the boat?

631
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:10,182
What happened to the boat?

632
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,184
It's right there.

633
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:20,592
This was a terrible investment.

634
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,594
Whew.
