1
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:04,487
Oh, my God, dude!

2
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:07,752
There is definitely a helicopter
pad on the roof of this building.

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,157
No, there isn't, Charlie.
Yes, there is.

4
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:13,459
Every single one of these corporate
buildings has a helipad on the roof.

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,056
Charlie is right. There's always
some big boss man fat cat...

6
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:18,295
that needs to be able
to escape by helicopter.

7
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,997
What is he escaping
from? Secret tunnels then.

8
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:22,801
Secrets tunnels?
There are no...

9
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:25,035
Secret tunnels, a monorail
system and a helipad.

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,339
Guys! Can we stop arguing?
There are two systems.

11
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:30,245
I don't wanna talk to this corporate
drone any longer than we have to.

12
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:33,773
We're split on the helicopters.
We'll come back to the secret tunnels.

13
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,785
That was an excellent
idea. I think we'd better.

14
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,481
But we can all agree we should
at least hear this guy out.

15
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,320
I guess. Yeah, sure.
Let's hear the guy out.

16
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,326
Okay, we'll hear him out.
We're agreed.

17
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,123
Sir, please continue.

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,525
O Okay. Right. Um...

19
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:54,059
As I was saying, when I went
down to your bar the other day...

20
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,163
nobody appeared to be working there.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,869
There were people there, but they were just
customers who seemed to be serving themselves.

22
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:02,344
We're out and about a
lot, bro. Get to the point.

23
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:04,472
Well, we here at Media
Restaurant Group...

24
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,541
really think that the location of
your bar would be a perfect spot...

25
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,916
for one of our Oldies Rock Cafés.

26
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,717
Shit, dude, how do I explain
this to you? I don't know.

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,281
This bar... it's who we are.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,385
All right?
It's all we've got.

29
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,396
It's our life. You
wouldn't understand that.

30
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,398
You corporate pigs think
you can just buy everything.

31
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,696
You can't buy everything.
We know your kind.

32
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:27,534
You big businesses going all over
town swallowing up all the small guys.

33
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:30,574
Well, guess what, pal...
Paddy's Pub can't be bought.

34
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:35,908
Okay. Well, if you would just
please take a look at our offer.

35
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,279
Yeah, man. We'll take
a look at it, but...

36
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,079
Sold!

37
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,615
There is no way I'm selling the bar.

38
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,813
It's time for a life of leisure, buddy.

39
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,914
It's time to retire and
collect that pension.

40
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,754
Think of all the money
we're gonna get.

41
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:24,727
What are you talking about?
The money from selling the bar.

42
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,492
We could retire to an island.
We'll all get fat and tan.

43
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,533
Dee, you're not gonna get shit.
No.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,500
We're the shareholders.
You own nothing.

45
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,538
Are you serious? I have been with
you guys since the very beginning.

46
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:37,403
I would think of Paddy's
as an Enron-type situation.

47
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:40,967
We're gonna cut and run, and we're gonna
leave you out there broke and jobless.

48
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:44,640
It's nothing personal. It's just
business. It's a business thing.

49
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:49,345
It does not matter one bit, because
I'm not selling the bar anyway.

50
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,411
Just take a look.
What is that?

51
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,151
That's the offer.

52
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,785
Let's sell this piece-of-shit bar.

53
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:00,763
Really? Really? Just like that?
See ya later, piece of shit!

54
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:05,132
Wait just one second. We have to
milk this cow for all she's worth.

55
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,194
We need to be wooed.

56
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,832
Yeah, I could go for being wooed.
Oh.

57
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:14,435
I'd love to be wooed. I
could go for some wood.

58
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:17,106
Uh, no. We're saying "wooed. "
Yeah.

59
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:20,582
We'll get some wood. We'll build something
cool. Then we'll go get the money.

60
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,881
That doesn't have anything to
do with what we're talking about.

61
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:25,218
We're talking about being
wooed by this corporate guy.

62
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,223
Dennis, just...
It's a waste of time?

63
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,282
How are you gonna be wood?
Let's just...

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,954
Let's just go and sell this
bar for everything we can get.

65
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,894
Let's do it, boys. Let's go!

66
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,991
Wait a second. What the
hell am I supposed to do?

67
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:40,162
Don't give a shit.

68
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,008
Hi. I need to apply for a job.

69
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,415
Right. Just fill out this application...

70
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,215
and I'll put it in the
stack with the others.

71
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:59,279
Dee? Hey.

72
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:02,190
Hi.
Are you applying for a job here?

73
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,989
Here?
Yeah.

74
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,189
What, are you crazy? Gross.
No, I would never work here.

75
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,495
I'm working here.
Hmm.

76
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,764
Yeah. I'm assistant managing. I
thought you worked at the coffee shop.

77
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,237
I do still, but a Starbucks
moved in across the street...

78
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,240
and they're stealing all our business.

79
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:21,074
Right across the street? Well, that
is good to know. I love Starbucks.

80
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:23,079
Oh.

81
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:27,049
That's why I'm working here. Do
you think you can get me a job?

82
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:30,884
Here? I thought you weren't
applying. No, that was a lie.

83
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:33,685
Oh. Um...
Here's my application.

84
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:38,195
Okay. Uh, you didn't fill it
out yet. I Know. You do it.

85
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,753
I don't mind. I'm gonna grab
a beer while you're doing that.

86
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,358
Come get me and give me all my
stuff, and I'll start. I don't...

87
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,869
Thank you so much.
This is awesome.

88
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,872
Did you go to high school or...

89
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,967
So, you guys ready to sell?

90
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,877
Whoa, whoa, whoa, pal.
Listen. We have terms.

91
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,609
Okay. What are your terms?

92
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,310
We'd like a plaque.

93
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,318
Of us... to be hung in
the new restaurant...

94
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,286
to pay tribute
and preserve our legacy.

95
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,482
Now, it could also
be a statue, okay?

96
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,320
Something real classy though.

97
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,724
Something like where
those American soldiers...

98
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:12,888
are raising that flag
up in that one war.

99
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:16,422
The war where we saved
Japan. Oh, correct. Hiroshima.

100
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,468
Actually, Charlie,
it wasn't Hiroshima.

101
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,470
I'm pretty sure
Hiroshima's in Japan.

102
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,768
We dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan.

103
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,831
Why the hell did we drop
a nuclear bomb on Japan?

104
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:28,003
They make all our cars. They're our
friends. Not my car. I buy American.

105
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,639
American cars are pieces
of shit. Everybody knows it.

106
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:33,616
You're making a big mistake. Japan
makes the best cars. And Germany.

107
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:36,084
The problem with Germany is
they don't make enough hybrids.

108
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:39,452
Excuse me. Excuse me.

109
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:42,856
Excuse me!
What? Put some...

110
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,157
Is that it?
Not even close.

111
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,824
It's the tip of the iceberg. We also
wanna be the ones to blow up the bar.

112
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,561
I'm sorry? Don't worry. We've
already worked out everyone's part.

113
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:55,128
Mac, he's gonna hold the spool.
Charlie's gonna do the countdown.

114
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:57,504
Frank and I, we're gonna push
the handle down... kablowie.

115
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:00,305
And I want the chopper.
No! No! No! No!

116
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:03,040
Excuse me, sir. I would
like a helicopter flyby.

117
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,742
I don't need to be in it. I just
want your corporate chopper...

118
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:08,148
to fly by my apartment
window real low and fast.

119
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,312
Okay. Okay, you know what,
here's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:12,652
I'm gonna pull the deal
off the table.

121
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:17,959
Fine. Then...

122
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,964
we'll go with the original offer.

123
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,192
No.

124
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,293
Well, something a little less than
the original offer. Less money?

125
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:29,396
We would accept something
substantially less.

126
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,998
I'm gonna go ahead
and offer you nothing.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,978
You promised that you would
not bring up the helicopter.

128
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,347
You're not the boss of me,
so quit...

129
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:43,080
Technically, Charlie, I am the boss
of you because I own half your shares.

130
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:47,090
Since when? You sold me half your
shares of the bar for goods and services.

131
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,388
Wait a second. You've definitely
given me half your shares too.

132
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,894
Maybe I gave you guys a couple shares
when my back was against the wall...

133
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,328
and I needed
a little breathing room.

134
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,559
You gave me a shitload of
shares for a half a sandwich.

135
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,228
What are you guys doing? Is this a
hose job where you're hosing me down?

136
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:03,000
You hosed yourself down. You hosed
yourself up and down, Charlie.

137
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:06,168
What do you want me to do?
I don't care. Get a job.

138
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:08,108
Oh, get a job? Just get a job?

139
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:11,239
Why don't I strap on my job helmet
and squeeze down into a job cannon...

140
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:15,046
and fire off into job land
where jobs grow on jobbies?

141
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,848
Now we're wasting time.
Will you get outta here?

142
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,583
You know what... I'm walking.
I can't stand you guys.

143
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:24,185
Whew. Now that we got rid of that dead
weight, let's come up with a strategy.

144
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:29,198
What's your plan? I'm thinking, if
this fat cat is not gonna woo us...

145
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:32,463
then we gotta woo him.

146
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah, uhhuh

147
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,303
I thought you guys were
taking me to dinner.

148
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,073
Come on. Who doesn't like to watch
a naked woman swing 'round on a pole?

149
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,809
Gay man, for one.
Huh?

150
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,444
I'm gay.
No.

151
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,114
You're so big and tough. You
do not come across as gay.

152
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,919
You don't look like a gay
guy. That's 'cause he's a bear.

153
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,755
Huh?
He's a bear.

154
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:01,286
Some gay guys are twinks, and others
are bears. This gay guy's a bear.

155
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,799
By the way, we're totally cool
with that. To each his own.

156
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:06,530
Wait. I'm a little confused
here. What's a twink?

157
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,572
A twink is small and
slender... like Mac.

158
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,470
No. I'm too muscular.
I would be a bear.

159
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,065
Don't think so.
Not hairy enough.

160
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,805
Smooth. I would be a bear.

161
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,279
See, I don't think
you'd be a bear either.

162
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,782
I don't know what you would be.
You're definitely not a twink.

163
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,512
I'd be a top. That's for sure.
Maybe.

164
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,986
Can a twink be a top, or
is that reserved for bears?

165
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,114
I'm sure there's a great deal
of switching back and forth...

166
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,022
but I think more often
than not bears are tops.

167
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:32,460
Unless they happen to be power
bottoms. What's a power bottom?

168
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,864
A power bottom is a bottom that is capable
of receiving an enormous amount of power.

169
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,401
Actually, you got it backwards.

170
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,131
A power bottom's generating all
the power by doing most of the work.

171
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:44,663
Does the power have to do with the
size or the strength of the bottom?

172
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,142
Dennis, I've heard that speed
has something to do with it.

173
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,475
Speed has everything to do with it.

174
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:52,778
The speed of the bottom informs the top
how much pressure he's supposed to apply.

175
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,011
Speed's the name of
the game. Right, buddy?

176
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,381
Goddamn it.

177
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,924
Now that you have your
silverware all set out...

178
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,552
you're gonna need to refill all the
ketchup bottles in your sections.

179
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,755
Ooh. That sounds like a whole thing.

180
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:09,994
Know what I'll do... if they start to get
empty, I'll just grab some from other tables.

181
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,399
No, because then someone else
is doing your work for you.

182
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,403
Yeah, which makes my job easier.

183
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,496
That's not how we do it here.

184
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:18,508
You actually have to follow
the rules. We're very strict.

185
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,669
Which means you probably
shouldn't be drinking beer while...

186
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:23,338
You probably should get used to
it because I'm gonna do it anyway.

187
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,814
Dee. Perfect. There you
are. Look, I need a...

188
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:28,875
Hello. This is a surprising turn.

189
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,547
Hello, Charlie. How
you doin'? This is good.

190
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:35,422
You working here or... Wow. Look
at you. You cracked the case.

191
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,619
Why are you here then? Kinda
hit rock bottom. Need a job.

192
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,424
Dee, can you hook me up
with a job here?

193
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,090
I've been here for, like, two
hours. Talk to the manager.

194
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,158
Oh, you're the manager
now. Good for you. Thanks.

195
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:48,933
Not an easy accomplishment. So,
job? I don't think so, Charlie.

196
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,600
You're pretty weird, you make me feel
uncomfortable, and you smell really bad.

197
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,109
You say that, but I
don't... I don't see it.

198
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,944
Look, when I'm at work, I am
all about work. Right, Dee?

199
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,506
Really does clean a mean
toilet. I'll sparkle it.

200
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,417
Fine. Okay, fine.
I will give you a job.

201
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,580
You can be the assistant
sanitation apprentice.

202
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:08,682
Oho! Nice. What does that guy do?
Hey!

203
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,388
That guy is gonna clean up vomit
and shit and put out grease fires.

204
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:13,862
Sold. Dee, get me a beer.

205
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,899
You can't drink beer on the
job. You can get your own beer.

206
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:18,025
I gotta get a beer...
take the edge off...

207
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:21,128
and then I'll get started doin' the
fires or whatever you want me to start.

208
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,621
What was it?

209
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:29,153
Hey. You need to talk to me?
Dee, yeah.

210
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:32,856
One of the bills that you dropped on one
of your tables was actually the wrong one.

211
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,990
No. I doubledropped it. I used
to do it at Paddy's all the time.

212
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:39,195
I use the same bill for two tables,
and I pocket the cash for the other one.

213
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,703
That's stealing.
I know.

214
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,400
We're sticking it to those
corporate bastards, aren't we?

215
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:46,204
We're not doing anything.
Okay. That's rude.

216
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:49,474
If they find out that I know that
you're doing this, I'm gonna lose my job.

217
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:51,708
You know what? I'm not
asking you to do much.

218
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:55,082
Just turn a blind eye while
I rob this place stupid.

219
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,882
No. I need this job.

220
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,582
Wow. Fine. Fine.
Okay.

221
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,386
I do.
Okay.

222
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,825
I have no idea why Dennis
thinks you're so cool.

223
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:06,090
Did you say that Dennis
thinks I'm cool? What's that?

224
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,098
Did you say that Dennis
thinks I'm cool?

225
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:13,069
He thinks you're really cool. But he's my
brother, so we recap the day with each other.

226
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,196
When I tell him about this,
I feel like he's gonna be...

227
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:18,538
You don't need to tell
him that this happened. No?

228
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,339
Because if you tell him
that I'm cool, then...

229
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:24,711
maybe we can forget that this
whole thing ever happened.

230
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,511
Deal.
Deal.

231
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:29,781
Knock, knock. Sorry to interrupt. Dee,
let's talk sugars for one quick second.

232
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,617
You got a sugar crisis on your tables.

233
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:34,351
Those little sugarholder things...
they don't refill themselves.

234
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:37,724
We're doing all the work for you, and
you're making your manager look bad.

235
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,524
Thanks, Charlie.
No sweat.

236
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,828
It's a team effort out there,
right? You gotta pick up your slack.

237
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,869
Otherwise, we're doing all the work
for you. You're getting a little close.

238
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,633
I think I was just stretching
out, and maybe you leaned in.

239
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,197
I don't think so, but let's
not let that happen again.

240
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,733
Didn't mean to do anything inappropriate.
I was just trying to help out.

241
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,645
Okay, you know what? Back to work,
everyone. Back to work, everybody.

242
00:11:57,715 --> 00:11:59,444
Back to work.
Back to work.

243
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,451
Will you please drop the act?

244
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,646
She is not into you, and
you're making me look bad.

245
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,951
You're making yourself look bad.
Your tables are pathetic, Dee.

246
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:09,083
You're not gonna impress her.
We'll see.

247
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,229
Yeah.

248
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,164
Oh!
He's still got it.

249
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,725
What is going on here,
Frank? Who are these guys?

250
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:20,896
These are the Yellow Jacket boys...

251
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,906
my old street gang from the '50s.

252
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,807
What exactly are your old,
pathetic friends doing here, Frank?

253
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:29,608
The corporate guy decided to
buy the bookstore down the block.

254
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,444
So me and the boys thought
we'd do a little loitering.

255
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:36,214
That's dumb. That is a dumb,
stupid, dumb idea. Dumb.

256
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,346
No, Dennis, it's not
that dumb of an idea.

257
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:41,721
If we can establish that there's a seedy
element outside of that bookstore...

258
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,090
maybe the offer comes back to us.

259
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:46,686
Exactly.
You guys do whatever you want.

260
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:49,756
I'm gonna go back to that Oldies Rock
Café and get Charlie and Dee back.

261
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,768
If we're not gonna sell the bar...

262
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:54,737
we at least need them here cleaning
our toilets and serving us our beer.

263
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:58,297
Great. Frank, please tell me that
you have another one of those jackets.

264
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,968
Not for you, bitch.

265
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,610
What the hell are you doing here?

266
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:09,551
We want you guys to come back
because they pulled out of the sale.

267
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,555
So you screw me over to sell
the bar, and then you blow it.

268
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:16,059
Now you want me to come back just to
serve you drinks and not pay me anything.

269
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,685
Is that a yes or... What is that?

270
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,491
That's a no, dick.
I am very happy here.

271
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:22,226
I will have you know I am
taking this place up the butt...

272
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,325
with a little scheme I like
to call Dee's Double Drop.

273
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:27,132
You're doing the double drop
here too? You know about this?

274
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:30,298
Oh, yeah. We always used to take
the difference out of your purse.

275
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,672
What? Are there always
this many chicks here?

276
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:34,643
Yeah. College crowd.

277
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,180
Oh, college chicks. I like that.

278
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:40,342
Tell you what. Why don't you
get me a job as a bartender here?

279
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:43,080
No. Screw you.
I'm not helping you.

280
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,985
Why wouldn't you help me?
What are you talking about?

281
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,253
How is it not obvious? It's
not obvious to me at all.

282
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:50,317
You are stupid. You
are straight up stupid.

283
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:53,386
Why the hell am I talking to you about
this anyway? You're just an underling.

284
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:56,024
Let me talk to a manager. I
think that's a very good idea.

285
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,558
Why don't you take this application
and go to the back office?

286
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:02,105
I'll send the manager
right in to you.

287
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,198
Okay, all right. Back here?
Back there.

288
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,709
You son of a bitch.

289
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,912
Hey. Sorry for keeping you waiting.

290
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,608
It's busy out there tonight.

291
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:14,310
So, Charlie Kelly.
Nice to meet you.

292
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:18,549
Uh, I understand you're looking
for a bartending position.

293
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,717
What the hell you doin'?
You're the manager here now?

294
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,783
Things move very quickly
here at the Oldies Rock Café.

295
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:27,456
May I? I need to look
over your forms here.

296
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:30,932
I think I'll just... Can I just
take a quick peek at that? Thank you.

297
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,971
Let's take a little
look-see here. Okay. Good.

298
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,972
Good, good.
This all looks good.

299
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,477
So, uh, tell me about Paddy's
Pub. Are you kidding me?

300
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,409
I think I need to know
what your duties were.

301
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,448
I'm not gonna answer any of
your... Did you do anything there?

302
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,780
I am not gonna answer any of your
questions. Just give me a job.

303
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,320
Really. Well, does not respond
well to authority. Noted.

304
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,948
Goddamn it. Goddamn you.

305
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,288
Language is a bit of an issue
here at the Oldies Rock Café.

306
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,988
Charlie! What are you
doing in my office?

307
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:02,260
A little research.
Are you... Dennis.

308
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,131
Hey.
Hi.

309
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:09,798
Wow, look at you. You
look... Lookin' good. Okay.

310
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,342
Are you the manager?
Yes.

311
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,278
First of all, let me just apologize to
you for never calling you back, ever.

312
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:20,909
And secondly, I'm here because
I'm looking for a bartending job.

313
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,920
Oh, well, maybe I should then...

314
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:27,253
I'll go and just get your...
uniform. Get me a uniform?

315
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:30,782
Is that what you were gonna say?
We said the same thing earlier.

316
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,795
Off you go.
Okay.

317
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,797
Okay.

318
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:37,026
What is her name again?

319
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,693
I hate you.

320
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:52,313
That was a knock, man.

321
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:55,443
This isn't very intimidating, Frank.

322
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,046
Don't worry. We're sending
out a strong message, Mac.

323
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:00,988
Hey, look, kids. It's
a '50s doowop group.

324
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,118
What? No, we're not
a '50s doowop group.

325
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:06,356
Would you sing us a
song? We don't sing, guy.

326
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,695
Oh, yeah, we do. We'll sing.
We'll sing for you. Right, boys?

327
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,634
You guys sing? Of course
we sing. We're a gang.

328
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:17,003
No, no! Gangsters don't sing! What are you
talking about? Ever hear of gangster rap?

329
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:20,737
We are not gonna intimidate anybody if we're
entertaining the whole goddamn neighborhood.

330
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,008
Are you kidding me? Listen to this.

331
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:25,639
One, two, three.
Bom, bom bom

332
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,980
Those darn Yellow Jacket boys

333
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,713
Buzz, buzz, bumble

334
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:33,621
They don't pay for soda pop
'cause they really rumble

335
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,852
Buzz, buzz, buzz

336
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,894
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Goddamn it!

337
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,590
Goddamn it!

338
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,598
Oohooh
Yeah

339
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,100
Bumba, babababa, oombaoom

340
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,330
Lick 'em and stick 'em, ladies!

341
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,831
Whoo!
Excuse me.

342
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:54,707
Wow. You know what? You are
not allowed to drink on the job.

343
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,509
What are you doing? I'm a
bartender. All I do is drink.

344
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:00,846
That's against the rules. We're not
actually following the rules, are we?

345
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,284
Hey, Cocktail, can I get those
drinks before my shift ends?

346
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:07,188
I'm sorry. I've been so busy getting so many
phone numbers. Yeah, what's that all about?

347
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,226
While you've been
picking up bar whores...

348
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,454
I have been doubledropping
like a bastard out there.

349
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,396
You're doubledropping again?
I never stopped doubledropping.

350
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,434
That is unbelievable.
What are you on about?

351
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:20,800
I thought we were sticking it to the
man. I am not sticking it to anyone.

352
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,964
This is my job. I
have to report you two.

353
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,873
Wow.

354
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,639
This tattletale business is
very ugly, isn't it, Dennis?

355
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:30,373
Yeah.

356
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,176
You know what, Dennis.

357
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,809
I took a chance giving you a job
here, and you're screwing me over.

358
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:38,377
Why are you being so needy? Do you
realize how unattractive that is to me?

359
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:41,447
Don't you wanna be
attractive to me? Come on.

360
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,652
All right, ladies. Who wants
to do a shot off my abs?

361
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:48,226
What's goin' on over
there? Are you all right?

362
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,200
I'm not all right. Dennis and
Dee are being complete assfaces.

363
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,259
I gave them a chance to work here.

364
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:55,498
They're stealing from the
restaurant, and I'm gonna get fired.

365
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:58,167
What? They're stealing?
Yes.

366
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:00,710
I will take care of Dennis
and Dee for you, all right?

367
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:02,837
I will rid you of
those two jerks. Really?

368
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:06,849
Yes. Thanks, Charlie.
That's really nice of you.

369
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,475
Hey, how about a hug
to cheer you up?

370
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:10,816
Well, a quick one.

371
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,413
Oh, for real? Oh, man.

372
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,151
Okay. That's good.

373
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,662
Doesn't this feel right?
That felt good. No. Thank you.

374
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:21,197
Wow. Why are you so sweaty?
It's really hot in here.

375
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:23,199
It's not hot. It's freezing.
It is freezing, isn't it?

376
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:24,632
They're blazing that A.C.

377
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,761
All right, listen, Yellow Jackets.

378
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:30,295
Just let me do the talking. I'm
gonna let my blade do the talkin'.

379
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:32,308
Jesus Christ, Frank!
No blades. Okay?

380
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:33,866
We're just sending him a message.

381
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,970
If he doesn't buy the bar,
then there's gonna be trouble.

382
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,311
You bet.

383
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:44,677
What are you people
doing at my house?

384
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:48,885
Well, actually, sir, we are here
just to talk. I'm not buying your bar.

385
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,053
Look, pal, you'd
better not mess with us.

386
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,063
You see Hawky over here?
Uhhuh.

387
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:57,396
He's crazy. I'm not sure
what he's capable of.

388
00:18:57,468 --> 00:19:00,665
Is that right? You got
something to say, old man?

389
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,240
Good night.

390
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:17,913
Guess what. I just topped myself for
most phone numbers in one day... nine.

391
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:20,354
Nine? Come on.
What do you think?

392
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,415
Six strawberry margaritas,
please. You got it, babe.

393
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:25,326
You know what? Don't make 'em, 'cause
you won't have your jobs much longer.

394
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:29,059
Corporate's on their way down
here right now to fire your asses.

395
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,725
What? You told on us?

396
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:34,430
Babe, don't do that to me. I feel like
we were getting so close, sweet baby.

397
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,939
He doesn't even know
your name. Yes, I do.

398
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:40,499
What's my name? What is it?
Beautiful.

399
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:43,603
Oh, my God. You're a dick. I
called you Beautiful all the time.

400
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,376
Would you not want to
be called beautiful?

401
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:47,178
One of you guys
the one who called me?

402
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,651
Right here. These are the
two that were stealing.

403
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,711
Wait a minute.
I know you. And you.

404
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,950
You're the guys who own that
dive bar down the street.

405
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:57,118
You're the corporate dude
with the helicopter. Right.

406
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:59,526
Here's the thing. I had a
really strange night last night.

407
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,530
Your friends
and their doowop group...

408
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:03,828
they showed up at my
house and attacked me.

409
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:07,997
One of them died on my doorstep,
and it sort of put me in a funk.

410
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:11,064
So I'm gonna clean house,
and you're all fired.

411
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:14,304
What?
Yeah. You guys are all fired.

412
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,608
I'm not fired.
I'm not fired, right?

413
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,116
Did you hire these people?
She sure did. She hired me.

414
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:23,950
Then clearly you're an idiot,
because these people are psychopaths.

415
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,421
But, no, you're not fired.
I'm just kidding. You are.

416
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,424
Everybody, get the hell
out of my restaurant.

417
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,460
Psychotic. Come on.
Goddamn it.

418
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,518
Goddamn it, Charlie!
Really?

419
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,791
How am I gonna pay
for my rent next month?

420
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,392
Don't worry about it. Come
live with me. Go to hell!

421
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,336
Whoa. She is strung up supertight.

422
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,396
You guys wanna do
some farewell shots?

423
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,169
Absolutely, buddy.
Here we go.

424
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,335
Hawky lived a fast, hard life.

425
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:52,178
Some stars shine so bright that
they burn out before their time.

426
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,183
We're gonna miss you, Hawky.

427
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:07,195
Okay. You ready, boys?
Yeah.

428
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:08,663
Boom, boom, boom, boom

429
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:11,860
Hawky never spoke much

430
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:15,735
But he had his doo-doo-doowop

431
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:23,611
Now you're buzzing around
that hive in the sky

432
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,549
Yellow Jacket Hawky
Oh, yeah

433
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:35,320
We bid you goodbye

434
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:42,227
Buzz
