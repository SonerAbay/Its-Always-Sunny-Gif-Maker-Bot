1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:05,003
<i>You're being ridiculous.
He's a professional football player.</i>

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,268
<i>I'm not talking about killing the guy.
I'm talking about going with a group...</i>

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,275
and intimidate him,
maybe break his arm.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,277
- You can't break Tom Brady's arm.
- Yes, I can.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,279
No more Super Bowls
for that pretty boy.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,283
Listen. Let me tell you something with absolute
honesty and concern for your well-being.

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,117
Tom Brady would kick your ass.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,624
- What the hell is that?
- Come on, who locked up last night?

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,626
- Charlie.
- The kid needs to start paying attention.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,390
- Who is this?
- I don't know. I've never seen him before.

11
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,556
Well, can you get him
out of here? He stinks.

12
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:37,069
Hey, let's go. Oh, my... Je...
Oh, my God. He shit his pants, Dee.

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,367
Oh, I don't wanna know that.

14
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,175
I'm gonna poke him with this.

15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,806
<i>Get up, old man. This isn't
the American Legion. Wake up!</i>

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,816
- Yo!
- What's the matter?

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,115
- He won't wake up.
- Well, poke him harder in his ribs.

18
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,418
<i>Wake up, old man.
Wake up!</i>

19
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,955
Holy shit.

20
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,190
That bitch is dead.

21
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,498
This ought to do wonders for business.

22
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,500
How could you let this happen, Charlie?

23
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,162
What? It's not my fault.
The guy orders one drink...

24
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,637
sits down, I don't see him
again the rest of the night.

25
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,675
What are we gonna do about this booth?
There's piss and shit everywhere.

26
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,370
- All the death germs.
- Plus, that guy was so old.

27
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,380
- Old people are gross.
- Tell you what. I'll get the gasoline.

28
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,315
- We're not gonna burn it.
- Come on, dude. You never let me burn anything.

29
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,753
- Maybe we should close to fumigate or something.
- No, no. We can't do that.

30
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,450
We can't let anybody know that
this happened. We'll never live it down.

31
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,291
Are we gonna serve drinks today? I don't think
the board of health will be too keen on that.

32
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,263
I'm sorry. Do you see any representatives
from the board of health here?

33
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,266
Let's clean up the mess
and act like it never happened.

34
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,826
- I'm not getting anywhere near that booth.
- Me neither.

35
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,975
I can't believe you guys
are making me do this.

36
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,308
I can't believe you left a dead guy
in the bar overnight. So I guess we're even.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,349
Charlie, the E. M. T. Said
he had a heart attack, not Ebola.

38
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,044
- Do you wanna do this?
- No.

39
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,020
Then don't question my methods.

40
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,957
<i>Whoa, Charlie! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Goddamn it.</i>

41
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,961
We need to isolate the area.

42
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,725
You're just gonna spread whatever
parts of him decomposed overnight.

43
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,131
- No.
- What, are you a scientist, dude?

44
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,000
- A scientist?
- That's, like, science talk.

45
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,505
<i>Science talk?
What the hell is science talk?</i>

46
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,974
I'm sorry. We're closed.

47
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,772
No, we're not.
Hey. How you doing?

48
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,211
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That's me. Actually...

49
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,272
<i>- Actually, I'm the owner.
- I could help her out now.</i>

50
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,783
- We own it together.
- Not really. What can I help you with?

51
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,619
My name is Rebecca Keane. I was notified
that my grandfather died here last night.

52
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,885
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

53
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,122
- That's really horrible.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

54
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,459
<i>I, uh... I just wanted to see
where he spent his last night.</i>

55
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,940
<i>Hmm, that would be somewhere
in this vicinity over here.</i>

56
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,171
- Oh, God.
- Are you all right?

57
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,614
Yeah, I'm okay. L... I really
didn't know him that well actually.

58
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,584
But he didn't have any other family,
so the police called me.

59
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,177
- Oh, that's so sad.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,850
I guess I was a little curious, you know.
I mean, he's my grandfather.

61
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,120
And I know nothing about him.

62
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,493
- Yeah. Well, he was a great man.
- Really?

63
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,022
Yeah. Yeah, just a very warm and...

64
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,127
gentle soul actually.

65
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:03,369
- So you knew him?
- Yeah, I wouldn't actually say that I knew him all that well.

66
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,469
I knew him pretty well.

67
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,743
Yeah, we got pretty close
near the end there.

68
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,716
<i>- Wow, really?
- I knew him too.</i>

69
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,412
L- I just meant...
I thought you meant more of a...

70
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,456
<i>- He didn't know him as well as I did though.
- Oh.</i>

71
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:22,460
Well, listen, I should go. I have to get
back to work. I just wanted to stop in.

72
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,588
Of course. Well, listen, if you
ever wanna stop by, you know...

73
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,999
I could tell you some stories about your
grandfather that you would not believe.

74
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,037
L- I'll make myself available as well.

75
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,198
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, any time.

76
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,708
Okay. Thanks.

77
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,744
<i>- Yeah, of course.
- Bye.</i>

78
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,780
- What are you doing, dude?
- What?

79
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,442
- You're totally blowing up my spot.
- I'm not blowing up your spot.

80
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:48,009
You can't just claim the girl for yourself.
She's way out of your league anyway.

81
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,954
Out of my league? She's out of
your league. I could get that chick.

82
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,222
Hey, guys! A man died here yesterday.
His family just abandoned him.

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,263
Could we think about
that for one second?

84
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,923
Why the hell would we want
to think about that?

85
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:07,029
- Really depressing, Dee.
- It just makes me think about Pop-Pop is all.

86
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,438
Pop-Pop is an asshole, Sweet Dee.

87
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,945
And I'm placing my bets that
that girl's grandfather is an asshole too.

88
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,480
People don't just abandon their parents
for no good reason.

89
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,574
<i>Dude, have you ever been
to a nursing home?</i>

90
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,347
People abandon their parents
all the time.

91
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,413
It's a sad, throwaway
culture we live in.

92
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,795
- Hey, Charlie. Can I come in?
- Hi.

93
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,357
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:42,170
Whoa. Geez, your place
is looking... good.

95
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,608
Yeah. I've been doing
some rearra... rearranging.

96
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,612
- Mm-hmm.
- So you wanna have a seat?

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,740
- Uh, no, I don't. Charlie, your, uh...
- Have a seat, come on.

98
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,751
Listen, I wanted
to ask you a favor.

99
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,812
Will you go to the nursing home with me
to see my grandfather? Dennis won't go.

100
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,585
- Dennis won't go?
- No, he won't go.

101
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,651
- What a jerk.
- I know, and I haven't seen him since I was really little.

102
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,663
And he's stuck in that nursing home.

103
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,564
And I don't wanna wait
until it's too late and then regret it.

104
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,227
Why don't you just go by yourself?

105
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,399
Uh, I have a little bit of
a problem with old people.

106
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:19,969
Sounds a little mean, but I find them
kind of creepy and scary and gross.

107
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,537
I think they're gross.
It's their hands mostly.

108
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,583
You know, how you can
see right through them.

109
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,584
They're all...
Their inside business is...

110
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,143
I'll tell you what.
I'll go with you...

111
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,520
but you have to let me borrow
your car any time I want.

112
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,149
No.

113
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,818
- Every now and then.
- No.

114
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,384
- One time.
- All right.

115
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,487
And... you have to
take me to lunch...

116
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,590
- twice a week for a year.
- No, I don't.

117
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,532
- Once a week. Today.
- Okay.

118
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,968
Great.

119
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,006
- I can get hot chicks, dude.
- Mac, don't embarrass yourself.

120
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,008
I will always win
in these circumstances.

121
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,408
<i>You will not, dude.
She's coming over here to see me.</i>

122
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,742
She's coming to see you because
you answered the phone, dude.

123
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,341
That's just semantics, bro. You know,
I have a real shot with this chick.

124
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,785
You can't beat me here, okay? I will
always win in these circumstances.

125
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,788
I will one-up you.
I'm sharper than you.

126
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,120
- You're not sharper. Shut up. Shut up.
- You shut up.

127
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,126
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Hi, guys.

128
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,889
Is this a bad time?

129
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,260
No, this is a great time.
We were just... We...

130
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,299
We were talking
about your grandfather.

131
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,301
Emotions are running
very high around here today.

132
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,530
Yeah, it's been a difficult
couple of days for me.

133
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,404
<i>Yeah, I try not to think about me
though in circumstances like this.</i>

134
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,205
More importantly, how are you?

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,840
<i>You kind oflook like
you're gonna pass out.</i>

136
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,283
Charlie, I don't think I can do this.
I'm not kidding.

137
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,286
Come on.
You're gonna be fine.

138
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,549
- Oh, my God. Look at that one.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

139
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,591
They have ears, all right?

140
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,355
All right, listen to me, Dee.
The slow and painful crawl to death...

141
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,362
is an inevitable part of life.

142
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,263
So just embrace it, all right?

143
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,638
Wait, wait, wait.
It's really creepy in here.

144
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:58,041
- What is that very bad smell?
- Uh, it's probably urine and maybe some feces.

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,443
- 17-D, right? This is your Pop-Pop's door.
- Just hold on a second.

146
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,245
- What if he asks us to help him go to the bathroom?
- Are you kidding me?

147
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,379
Come on. A lot of people lead
perfectly normal lives in nursing homes.

148
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,183
Oh, Jesus! He doesn't even
look like a real person.

149
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,990
- Should we go wake him up?
- No! I don't know. Let's go.

150
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,463
No, we can't go. We came all the way
down here. Let's just...

151
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,133
- I need some air.
- What?

152
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,230
No, no, no, Dee. Do not leave me
here alone. 'Cause I can't...

153
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,241
Dennis.

154
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,039
- Dennis.
- Oh, this is awkward. I'm... I'm not...

155
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,048
Dennis, come here.

156
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,277
<i>L- I've been waiting...</i>

157
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,785
a long time for this moment, Dennis.

158
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,759
Okay. You have?

159
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:54,528
Oh, yeah. My only grandson finally
come to see me. Come close.

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,467
My eyesight's not so good.

161
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,203
You're lot shorter than
I thought you'd wind up.

162
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,609
Yeah, well, you know.
I'm actually still growin', so...

163
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,705
- You want some candy?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

164
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,716
Eat the damn candy!

165
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,979
Okay. Candy.

166
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,414
These people in here...

167
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,756
they've stolen everything from me.

168
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:27,265
- They have?
- Yeah, well, what do you expect from Jews, right, Dennis?

169
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,100
Uh...

170
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,368
Jews. Um, maybe I should go
and check on Dee, because...

171
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,001
No, leave her be.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

172
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,813
I'm an old man, Dennis.

173
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,857
And as you can see,
I don't have much time left.

174
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,893
I need your help.

175
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,555
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

176
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,996
I mean, I'm not very
comfortable with that.

177
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,058
First of all, I don't even know which one
of these things I would unplug.

178
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,103
No, you idiot!

179
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,038
I don't need you to kill me.
I need you to help me.

180
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,339
Oh. Uh, okay.

181
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:17,815
You probably don't know this because that
bastard father of yours didn't tell you...

182
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,443
but I was a war hero.

183
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,252
- Really?
- I wanna be buried in my uniform.

184
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:30,762
And I don't trust any
of these kikes in here...

185
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,196
<i>to take care of that.</i>

186
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,531
All the belongings from
that part of my life are in a box...

187
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,629
at the Roxborough
Storage Facility.

188
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,733
<i>I need you to pick it up
and bring it here.</i>

189
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,507
<i>Oh, okay, sure.
I could do that.</i>

190
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,450
And I need you to keep it
as a secret between you and me.

191
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,512
Okay.

192
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,021
<i>So listen, I have a favor
to ask you guys.</i>

193
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,187
Oh, yeah. That's cool.
Anything, yeah.

194
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,663
You can talk to me,
'cause I get things done, so...

195
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,895
I'm in charge of putting together
a memorial service for him...

196
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,461
but I can't seem to find anyone else
who really knew him that well.

197
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,565
Oh, yeah. That might be
difficult to do actually.

198
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,304
It's not gonna be a problem.
I knew a lot of his friends. Good guys.

199
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,212
Yeah, Den. But, uh, it might be
hard to find "friends."

200
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,682
It's not gonna be hard for me.

201
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,685
That would be so amazing.

202
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,253
- Would you like another drink?
- No, we're fine.

203
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,003
- I need your car.
- Oh, Charlie. I wasn't really serious about that.

204
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,133
- No. Go get it. You promised.
- Fine.

205
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,769
- Where you going?
- Going back to see Pop-Pop.

206
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,279
What the hell you talking about?
You're going to see my Pop-Pop without me?

207
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,577
- Mm-hmm.
- You can't do that. He's my Pop-Pop.

208
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,244
I'm the one who's supposed to feel
better about myself. I'm going with you.

209
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,220
Oh, you can't actually, because
it's just supposed to be me and him.

210
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,019
- I want to see my Pop-Pop.
- Take the bus.

211
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,131
Jesus, Dennis.
This is just goddamn shady.

212
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,534
Hey, bud. If you wanna
back out now, be my guest.

213
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,402
- I'd be happy to take all the credit for this.
- I'm not backing down.

214
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,807
All right, all right. Hey, pal.

215
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,004
How would you
like to make 20 bucks?

216
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,604
- Sure.
- Got some nicer clothes?

217
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,252
- Right.
- Right.

218
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,336
Holy shit.

219
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,944
Okay, guys. Have fun. Mingle.

220
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,345
<i>- Hey, guys. - Hey,
Rebecca. - Rebecca.</i>

221
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,513
I see you brought some of
my grandfather's friends.

222
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,523
He loved those guys.

223
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,854
So I was wondering if maybe
you guys could say something.

224
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,865
You know, maybe tell a funny story
about him or something.

225
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,902
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely. Actually,
I've got a little something prepared.

226
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,870
If that's okay.
Mac, did you prepare...

227
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,399
Oh, no. Sorry. I totally forgot.
He's a terrible public speaker.

228
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,037
<i>He gets really flustered and he clams up
and his third-grade stutter comes back.</i>

229
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,513
<i>It's adorable. Oh, is that your phone?</i>

230
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,574
- Yeah.
- Gonna answer that?

231
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,109
- Well, I don't wanna be rude.
- Well, the ringer's going off in the middle of a funeral.

232
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:46,214
It's gotta be pretty important, right?

233
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,952
Excuse me.

234
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,397
- Charlie, what do you want?
- Mac, you gotta come to my apartment right now.

235
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,401
I can't, dude.
I'm in the middle of something.

236
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,632
I don't care what you're doing.
Get over here right now! It's an emergency!

237
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,640
Fine.

238
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,907
- I gotta go. It's an emergency.
- You gotta leave? That's a shame.

239
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,351
- So can I borrow your car, or what?
- You've been drinking.

240
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,082
Uh...

241
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:23,919
He's a good guy. He's just...
got a bit of a drinking problem.

242
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,962
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Mac, dude. This better be good.</i>

243
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,899
Holy shit!

244
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,171
Mmm.

245
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,783
- This is unbelievable!
- I know that! There are, like, so many medals in there, dude!

246
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,223
This guy was probably, like, king Nazi.

247
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,454
- How is this even possible, Charlie?
- Oh, it's possible.

248
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,759
- They came on boats or whatever, but they're here.
- Okay, hold on.

249
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,494
- This could just be collector's crap.
- No. No, no, no. No.

250
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,570
<i>Look at that!</i>

251
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,400
- He looks exactly like Dennis.
- I know.

252
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,135
All right, so here's the deal.

253
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,508
He wants me to take all this shit to him
so he can be, like, buried in it or something.

254
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,241
Buried in it?
Screw that old bitch. He's a Nazi.

255
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,307
Let him die and burn in hell, right?
Let's sell this shit on eBay.

256
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,217
No, I thought about that though.
I think it's, like...

257
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,654
illegal, or maybe
a little bit immoral.

258
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,196
- We could sell it to a museum.
- I could live with that.

259
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,067
Lionel Keane.

260
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,408
As we all know, Lionel
could be a bit of a curmudgeon.

261
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,969
But he had the heart of a lion.

262
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,708
I'll tell you a story about him.

263
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,084
It was Christmas Eve
last year and, uh...

264
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,646
I was at Lionel's house,
making him dinner.

265
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,626
And we got to talking
about the spirit of giving.

266
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:05,026
And I said, "Lionel, why are we
just talking about it?

267
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,589
Let's put the spirit into action.
Let's go down to the mission."

268
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,795
Lionel said, "Great.
That's a great idea, Dennis."

269
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,804
So we did, we went down there.

270
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,466
<i>And not only did we feed...</i>

271
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:22,412
every last poor,
miserable, precious soul...

272
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,882
but we washed the feet of every man,
woman and child there...

273
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,122
in the spirit of Christ.

274
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,952
<i>And that was Lionel.</i>

275
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,993
Lionel Keane.

276
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,758
Lionel the lion.

277
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,729
<i>- Sorry to keep you gentlemen waiting.
- Not a problem at all.</i>

278
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,536
- How can I help you?
- We are going to make your day today, sir.

279
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,773
- Is that right?
- We've gotten our hands on a "little something"...

280
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:58,111
that we like to think is
an important part of human history...

281
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,175
and needs to be in this museum.

282
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,612
Mac, if you will.

283
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,550
What in the hell is that?

284
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:13,087
This, my friend, is an authentic
Nazi officer's uniform circa 1942.

285
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,464
Notice the stitching
and fine attention to detail.

286
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,003
Where did you get this?

287
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,268
Let's just say it found its way to us
and leave it at that, shall we?

288
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,071
Okay. I find this offensive
for so many reasons.

289
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:29,875
I'm guessing you acquired this
through illegal means.

290
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,940
For me to take this from you
would be an extension of that.

291
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,953
And secondly, that you would
expect it would "make my day"...

292
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,957
assumes that I'm interested in profiting off
the murder of millions of innocent people.

293
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,830
How much will you
give us for it?

294
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,593
Nothing.

295
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,763
Nothing, or...

296
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,602
I plan to call the police
the minute you guys leave my office.

297
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,134
- Hey, Pop-Pop.
- Deandra?

298
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:28,866
What are you doing here?
Where's Dennis?

299
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,636
Oh, um, I just came by myself.

300
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,373
Oh. Well, do you know
where Dennis is?

301
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,813
He was supposed
to be here hours ago.

302
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,284
No, no. Pop-Pop, it's just me.
I thought that...

303
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,287
you and I could spend
some time together...

304
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,324
so I brought a couple books
that I could read to you.

305
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,384
Okay, fine.

306
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,396
Come here and sit down.

307
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,398
Yeah.

308
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:01,836
No, why don't you come closer
so I can get a good look at you?

309
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,500
- Come here, come here.
- Okay, that's fine.

310
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,672
- Sure, sure, sure.
- Good idea.

311
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,115
Come here.
A little closer. Come here.

312
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,176
Come on, come on.
Come here, come here.

313
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:21,158
Oh, now I remember
how beautiful you are.

314
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,925
And look at these wrinkled old hands
against your young face.

315
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,965
Oh, and... and these teeth.

316
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,992
Look. Look how straight and white.

317
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,129
Is there a bathroom around here?

318
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,834
Yeah. Right down the hall.

319
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,572
We're doing
the right thing here, man.

320
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:45,138
Yeah. But it just seems like a waste
of a perfectly good Nazi uniform.

321
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,812
No, no, no. If we sell it,
we run the risk of going to jail.

322
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,084
And if we keep it, we don't get anything,
so we may as well burn it.

323
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,352
- That's true.
- I mean, it is always fun to burn things.

324
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,087
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

325
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,652
And we probably shouldn't let Dennis
know about his grandfather anyway.

326
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,891
- No.
- It might just screw with his head.

327
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,530
- Yeah, get it going.
- All right.

328
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,596
<i>- Get on.
- Get on it.</i>

329
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,733
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, my friend.</i>

330
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,278
- Whoo.
- Whoo.

331
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,837
- So it's all in there, right?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,578
- You didn't keep anything, or...
- No. Did you?

333
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,416
- No. No, dude.
- Okay.

334
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,718
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, bro.

335
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,191
- Hey.
- What's up? What you burning?

336
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,524
- Some trash.
- Awesome.

337
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:33,962
- Do you wanna hear what happened with that girl?
- No. No, I don't, dude.

338
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,863
No? Oh, come on.

339
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,959
- I don't care about what happened.
- Of course you care.

340
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,731
- I don't wanna hear it, Dennis.
- Yeah, you do.

341
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,172
Okay. You know what, bro?
I'm sorry. You win. Okay?

342
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,175
I give up. You won.
You're the better man.

343
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,269
You don't give up. See, I won
fair and square. We went head-to-head...

344
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:51,110
and I came out the better man,
just as I predicted I would.

345
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,310
So we went back to her house...

346
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:58,482
and we made sweet,
passionate love.

347
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,728
- Great.
- Yeah.

348
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,129
Great for you. You...
You must be really proud of yourself.

349
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,727
Awesome. Your grandfather's a Nazi.

350
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,319
Who's your neighbor?

351
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,980
<i>I'm your neighbor.
But let me ask you a couple questions.</i>

352
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,081
<i>- Go ahead, shoot.
- Ask away.</i>

353
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,490
<i>- Who lives in this here hole?
- What hole?</i>

354
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,393
<i>- That big brown hole.
- Oh, I'm inside that hole.</i>

355
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,988
<i>- Dozen Rangers in there too.
- All right. Well...</i>
