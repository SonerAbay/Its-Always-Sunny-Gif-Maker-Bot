1
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,636
<i>Where is it? It was right here.</i>

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,438
- <i>I cannot find it. And by the way, Mac,</i>
- _

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,439
<i>what are you even talking about? The word is</i>

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,441
"superstition," not "stupidstition."

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,383
I know what the word is, Charlie.

6
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,387
I'm saying your Green Man
suit is a stupid superstition.

7
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:19,140
Oh, really?
Then why do the Eagles keep winning?

8
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,276
Also, by the way, dude,
uh, you're a Cowboys fan,

9
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:24,078
- so shut the hell up.
- I'm not a Cowboy fan, I'm a Tony Romo fan,

10
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,497
and he retired, so now I bleed green.

11
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:26,498
- Go, Birds, go, Birds!
- All right, well,

12
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,950
I'm not going to the Super Bowl without it.
I got to find it.

13
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,351
Yeah, don't make us late,
Charlie, all right?

14
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:32,420
I-If you can't find it,
you can't find it, you know?

15
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:34,972
The-the fans have no effect on
the outcome of the game, anyway.

16
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,043
- Do you know how football works?
- Yes, that's right,

17
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,177
your voodoo bullshit is not
gonna mean anything at the...

18
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:41,112
What? What's going on with your eye?

19
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:42,980
Uh, nothing, I got a...
I think I got an eyelash in it.

20
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,049
You're, like,
scratching it and it's blinking...

21
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,251
I just, I slept on it funny.

22
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,118
What the hell is the holdup here?

23
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:49,320
Frank, this is why I wanted

24
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:51,472
total control over the guest list,
all right?

25
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:54,275
The eyes of the world are
gonna be on Philadelphia.

26
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:58,112
And I want to show them that we
are not just degenerates, okay?

27
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:01,149
And that is why I'm very
nervous about these guys.

28
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:03,084
Yeah! Chug, chug, chug!

29
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,285
Chug, chug, chug!

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,020
- Chug, chug, chug!
- Hey!

31
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,087
Chug... boom!

32
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,173
That's 15.

33
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:10,975
Post that, Jack, post it, baby.

34
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,176
I can't... it doesn't work with this, uh...

35
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,179
- Oh!
- Oh, come on.

36
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:17,048
No big, giant, ridiculous hands.

37
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,384
What? What? D-Don't make me go without them.

38
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,119
I'm not making you go at all.

39
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:22,453
Frank, these people are the worst.

40
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:25,206
Come on, Mac. This is the salt of the earth.

41
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,274
These people represent Philadelphia.
That's right.

42
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,143
- Yeah.
- You have literally picked out

43
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,479
the biggest pieces of shit in the city.

44
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:34,214
I got to agree with that.
These guys are pieces of shit.

45
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,284
- What is in your mouth?
- Chew.

46
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:38,419
- Awesome, cool, good to see you.
- Oh, my God.

47
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,353
- Cricket.
- Yeah, baby?

48
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:40,988
Bad news, you're out.

49
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,852
- What? Wait, why?
- Well, you are literally

50
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:45,109
the worst representation of the entire city.

51
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,378
- Oh...
- Your nose is bleeding as we speak.

52
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,179
Okay, I came up portside on a horse,
and he was a little quicker than me...

53
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,381
that's lesson learned.

54
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:52,116
You can't bump Crick.

55
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,518
- I can, I have, and I will.
- Oh, God.

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,120
I have an alternate. Here he comes.

57
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,455
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, hey!

58
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,008
- Pumped for the big game?
- Yeah, baby.

59
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,076
Yes. Now, see, Rex represents the best

60
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,411
- that Philadelphia has to offer.
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:05,946
Either way, Cricks, you're out.
Get out of here.

62
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,281
- Unbelievable. I mean...
- All right, Crick, all right.

63
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,283
- You're the worst.
- We got to go, we got to go.

64
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:12,287
Yo, check it out. I got one last surprise.

65
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:20,378
Here you go, here you go.

66
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,913
- Is this a bar?
- Nice.

67
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,148
- Nice.
- Fully stocked, baby.

68
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,186
- You found it!
- All right.

69
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,139
You found the damn suit... can we go now?

70
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,074
E! A! G!

71
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,510
L! E! S! Eagles!

72
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,945
_

73
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,873
♪ The eye of the tiger... ♪

74
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:07,559
Yeah.

75
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:12,864
Wait for it.

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,533
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,535
No, no, no. We're gonna sing it again?

78
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,736
This is, like, the tenth time.

79
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:20,572
Oh, yeah, i-it turns out
there's not that many songs

80
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,689
about Philadelphia.

81
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:22,757
Aw, man...

82
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,494
Uh, Charlie.

83
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,629
- What happened to your nose?
- Uh...

84
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:28,763
You're bleeding, man.

85
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:30,832
Uh, um. Oh, all right.

86
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:31,966
- All right, fine, it's me.
- Oh!

87
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,768
- Cricket.
- Cricket!

88
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:35,904
Yes, it's me, it's me.
I snuck on, all right?

89
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,352
- Ah, this damn nose.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh. We should, uh,

90
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:42,594
uh, we should probably go back
for Charlie, right? But...

91
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:46,579
Ah, I don't want to set a
precedent of little mishaps

92
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:49,699
setting us back, so...

93
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,727
Cricket, you're back in.
We're going to the Super Bowl.

94
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:54,835
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey, Mac, uh,

95
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,757
what about the waitress?
She's gonna want to turn around.

96
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:59,561
- Sh-She don't even like football.
- Oh, yeah, football sucks.

97
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,629
But if Charlie missed the bus,
he missed the bus.

98
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:05,662
I'm not missing a second
of my dreamboat, Tommy Terrific!

99
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,769
- Go, Pats! Go, Pats! Go, Pats!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drive! Drive!

100
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,904
Go, Pats! Go, Pats! Oh, shit, pothole.

101
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,594
Oh, something kicked loose inside.

102
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,596
- Oh, that was bad. That was bad.
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,597
You're not looking so good, Frank.

104
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,389
- Yeah.
- You want a protein shake?

105
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:22,534
- No. No.
- Brought a couple cases

106
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,535
of my new Invigaron berries
to hock at the game.

107
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,804
Invigaron?

108
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,560
You're involved in that pyramid scheme, too?

109
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:30,296
No. No hocking berries
at the Super Bowl, Rex.

110
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:31,634
Just be meat, okay?

111
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:32,894
Well... take off your shirt, please.

112
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,532
It's so cold, Mac.

113
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,765
- And you. What's going on with you?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

114
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:40,902
Just a little intestinal cramping.
I'll be fine.

115
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:44,355
- Come on, let's rent a car and ditch these dodos, okay?
- Oh, Jesus.

116
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,724
W-What's wrong with your eye?
It's, like, way worse.

117
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,660
Okay, I get it, I get it.

118
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:51,730
It's "Pick on Dee for No Reason Day."
Real original.

119
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:54,866
Uh, okay.

120
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,736
Oh, man, I got grease on my jean shorts.

121
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,005
All right, well, uh, all right,
there's good news and bad news.

122
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,803
The bad news is, the axle's bent,
and this bus isn't going anywhere.

123
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:08,496
But the good news is,
is we passed a Walmart a few miles back.

124
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:09,898
So you can go get some parts.

125
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,766
Oh, no, no, no. They don't have axles there.

126
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:13,968
But I can get a new pair of jean shorts.

127
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:16,905
Damn it, Frank. I knew this would happen.

128
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,590
We invite the wrong crowd,
and now we've got people

129
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,592
going on expeditions for jean shorts.

130
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:24,529
And hocking magical berries
and rooting for the Patriots?

131
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:25,730
This always happens to us.

132
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:28,472
Every single thing we do turns to shit.

133
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:31,917
And now, we finally have an
opportunity to be something,

134
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:33,738
to be winners, and we're not gonna make it.

135
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:37,492
We are never,
ever gonna make it to the Super Bowl.

136
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,827
Well...

137
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:44,899
<i>E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!</i>

138
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:48,354
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Super Bowl LII.

139
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,755
Well, we made it to the Super Bowl.
That was easy.

140
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,657
Yeah, it was incredibly smooth.

141
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,925
All right, guys,
let's go out into the stadium,

142
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,727
see what we can get ourselves into.

143
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,595
Guys, guys.

144
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,597
Let's just stay in the box, all right?

145
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,799
You know, for the whole game,
everybody just stays in the box.

146
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:07,405
Let's-let's cool it on the boos, you know?

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,557
That's-that's kind of, like,
what we're famous for, you know?

148
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:13,494
We-we boo ourselves,
we boo the Eagles, we boo Santa Claus.

149
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:16,402
Let's save our boos,
for the team that deserves it.

150
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:19,567
And that's the most successful franchise
in the history of organized sports.

151
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:22,704
Okay. Let's just be the most respectful
Philly fans we can be.

152
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,722
Mac's right. Everybody,
just act like you belong.

153
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:29,661
- What? What?
- That's okay to boo.

154
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:31,930
Yeah, Dee, your eye does not look good.

155
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,599
Okay, "Everybody look at me,
I'm a stupid Pats fan,

156
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,601
making up stuff about Dee's eye."

157
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,853
Dee, you definitely have pink eye.

158
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,922
I-I don't have pink... all right.

159
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:43,825
Would a person with pink eye do this?

160
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:45,760
Would she do that?

161
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,629
- Boo.
- What?

162
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,030
- Guys, the game's gonna start. Kickoff, kickoff.
- Oh!

163
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,965
Kickoff, kickoff.

164
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,568
Guys, stay positive. Stay positive.

165
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,638
Gostkowski approaches the football,

166
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,891
and Super Bowl LII is underway.

167
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:03,928
Oh, I like this drive, boys.

168
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:05,663
I like this drive.

169
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,714
Birds look good. Birds look good.

170
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:09,534
Frank, what's going on, man?

171
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,001
- Huh?
- What's wrong with you?

172
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:12,737
I just got to go to the bathroom.

173
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:14,755
We can go? Let's take a, take a walk.

174
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,356
Well, h-hold on one second.
They're... Eagles are driving.

175
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,360
- Let's just wait till there's a break in the action.
- I got to pee.

176
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:23,007
Hello. Someone has been pushing
the call button. Nonstop.

177
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:27,104
Oh, that's me.
Yeah, I-I choked down some dogs too fast.

178
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,636
They-they didn't settle, you know?

179
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:29,838
They came back up, actually.

180
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,789
On the other dogs.

181
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:34,485
Yeah, we're gonna need some
reinforcements there, pal.

182
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,795
Can we get some binoculars up in here, too?

183
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,204
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,598
How did I move all the way to Minnesota,

185
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,733
and I'm still waiting on you people?

186
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:43,668
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

187
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,937
- I've waited on you.
- I-I don't know this guy.

188
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,071
- No, you never waited on us.
- Uh-uh.

189
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,689
- We don't live in Minnesota, bud.
- Yeah.

190
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:49,957
I have waited on you back in...

191
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,826
Uh, you know what? It's not worth recapping.

192
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,695
W-What's the point?

193
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:54,896
Hey, man.

194
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:56,698
You seem a little stressed... ooh.

195
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,900
You're kind of frail. You need to get swole.

196
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:02,703
What if I told you there's a berry
that can handle all your fitness needs?

197
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,589
I'm good, but thank you.

198
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:05,957
I'm just gonna go do my job.

199
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:09,632
Oh!

200
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,868
I tied his shoelaces together.

201
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:21,990
This Minnesota rube, he's not ready
for your big-city shenanigans, Frank.

202
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,626
Waiter, run and go get us some beer,
would you?

203
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,628
And the kick is good.

204
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:30,498
And the Eagles lead Super Bowl LII...

205
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,834
I got to pee now. I got to pee now.

206
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,836
- Yeah, let's go now.
- All right. There's a break in the action.

207
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,538
- Frank, we got to come back fast. Come back fast.
- I got to go.

208
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,331
Oh! God! Damn it!

209
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,399
What's going on over there, Frank?

210
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,440
I got a kidney stone.

211
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,271
Oh. O-On the bus.

212
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,223
I felt a little piece of
kidney stone break off

213
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,425
and go through the, into the bladder.

214
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:59,493
Why didn't you tell me that
you have a kidney stone, dude?

215
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,162
I don't want to freak you out.

216
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,164
Well, you're freaking me out now, man.

217
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,166
Oh, shit, we're missing something.

218
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:08,369
Listen, Frank.
This kidney stone better not screw us up.

219
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,104
I can manage.

220
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,457
This ain't my first rodeo.

221
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:16,085
The P.A.T. is no good. He missed it.

222
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,894
Yes!

223
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:22,106
We don't see the touchdown and
then they miss the extra point?

224
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,334
Dee, how'd the Eagles score?

225
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:25,402
Who knows?
I can't see a goddamn thing this high up.

226
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,138
These seats are the worst.

227
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:28,356
You can't see because you have

228
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:31,492
a very serious bacterial
infection in your eye.

229
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:34,162
- Hey, you got new hands.
- Oh, yeah.

230
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,162
Oh, I like them.

231
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

232
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,232
Where do you think you're going?

233
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:40,368
Oh, ding-dong here's getting honored
with the rest of the vets.

234
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:42,236
I'm gonna sneak down there with him.

235
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:44,172
When we get close to the field,
I'm gonna let you in

236
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,124
on a little plan I've whipped up.

237
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,192
No, no plans, all right?
Just stay in the box.

238
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,194
Guess what? No one's talking to you, okay?

239
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:51,329
All right, when we get close to the field...

240
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:54,399
Whoa. Dee.
Both your eyes are looking real bad.

241
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,468
Oh, yeah, that pink eye's disgusting.

242
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:59,136
So, you know what, you can go, but I'm,

243
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,271
I'm just gonna cover you up

244
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:02,290
so people don't know that
you're from Philadelphia.

245
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,359
Go. Go. Go.

246
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:07,095
Mac, come on. What're we doing up here, huh?

247
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,498
L-Luxury suite? Napkins? Utensils?

248
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,434
We're going soft up here
in this ivory tower.

249
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:15,236
I mean, if they get to go, we should, too.

250
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:19,257
Come on, let us loose, Mac.
Unleash the fury!

251
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,391
I mean, how's Brady even supposed to know

252
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,260
I'm here in this stupid box? The guy...

253
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:24,884
Tom Brady does not care that you are here.

254
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,923
Guys, nobody leaves the box!
All right? And you.

255
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,400
Take off the goddamn shirt!

256
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,270
Whoa.

257
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,204
Oh...

258
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,090
What am I looking at here, Rex?

259
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:38,226
It's the Invigoron berries, man.

260
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:41,228
They're loaded with sugar,
but I'm in too deep.

261
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:44,365
I've got to sell 40 cases of this stuff
or I'm gonna lose my apartment.

262
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:46,367
The snap is good,
the hold is perfect...

263
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:52,404
Oh, yes! In your face! In your face!

264
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,126
Brady hands off to James White.

265
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,327
He's across the 20,

266
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,130
avoids another tackle and
crosses the goal line.

267
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,464
- Touchdown, Patriots.
- Yes!

268
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,134
Hell yeah, another Patriots touchdown.

269
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:05,202
Tommy Touchdown coming to get y'all. Yes.

270
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,404
You know what? You get out, too.

271
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,471
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

272
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:08,489
- I can go?
- Yes.

273
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,358
All right. Tommy, Mama's coming.

274
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:12,093
I got to piss.

275
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,561
The stone's making me go. I got to go.

276
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:16,030
Frank, I've already taken you,
like, three times, all right?

277
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:18,499
And all I've got to see are
good plays by the Patriots.

278
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:21,168
- Let the man piss.
- Yeah, I got to go.

279
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:25,389
No. Every time Frank goes to the bathroom,
the Eagles score.

280
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,128
Are you pissing?

281
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,397
Piss, Frank, piss.

282
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,178
I'm pissing, and it hurts like shit.

283
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:35,132
What's going on with the game?

284
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,467
Just keep peeing. I don't know.
It's not updating.

285
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,335
...throws into the end zone.

286
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:40,138
Touchdown!

287
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,156
- Us or them? Us or them?
- I don't know, Frank.

288
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:44,092
- I don't know. What happened? Wha...?
- Hey-oh!

289
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:47,228
- Pondy, what happened?
- Eagles score!

290
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:50,497
Yes!

291
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,634
Pondy, I need you to bring
as much beer to this bathroom

292
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,335
as you possibly can.

293
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:57,171
- Frank, drink!
- Got to piss.

294
00:11:57,306 --> 00:12:00,258
I need you to piss
through this entire game, Frank.

295
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:02,460
- We can't leave this bathroom.
- I want to...

296
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,494
The Eagles need us.

297
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:24,132
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Hold on. You need a pass.

298
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,461
- Hey, whoa, watch out. Watch where you're going.
- Oop, sorry.

299
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,064
- Open your eyes.
- Sorry. Oh.

300
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:49,290
Perfect timing, man.
I need to get this out to Brady.

301
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,225
Brady's ready to go out.

302
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:54,295
He's really wiping that
sweat off with that towel.

303
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:55,496
I mean, he's really going at it.

304
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:57,432
Just squirt some out, man, squirt it out.

305
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,301
I can't piss no more. It hurts like shit.

306
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,368
You got to force it out, then.

307
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,370
Where's Pondy with the beer? Oh!

308
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,323
You, you! Ten beers, stat.

309
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,058
I'm off duty,
just here to go to the bathroom.

310
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:10,333
- Mac, the crew got out.
- What?

311
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,096
- It's not just a berry.
- Oh, no.

312
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,466
It's a berry found deep in the
jungles of the Amazon forest,

313
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:17,468
and available for the first time!

314
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,270
I'm a happy client.

315
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:23,424
First down! Whoo, yeah. I love you, Tom.

316
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:29,296
And it's always nice to see
our nation's troops being honored.

317
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,365
We are Philadelphia!

318
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:34,301
These guys are a total embarrassment.

319
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,305
We blew it, man.

320
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:40,057
Now Brady's got the ball with
two and a half minutes left.

321
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:41,325
He's gonna take the ball down the field,

322
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,260
he's gonna score,
and he's gonna win the game.

323
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,329
Because that's who he is, man.

324
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:48,065
And you know who we are? We're losers.

325
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,399
All of Philadelphia.

326
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:52,336
We're angry, and we're mean and we're cruel.

327
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,539
And we act like jerks,
and now these assholes,

328
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,491
they can't even bring us beer
so that you can pass the stone

329
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,627
and we can win the game.

330
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:05,233
No. No, no, Mac. You got 'em all wrong.

331
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,433
No.

332
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:10,370
Those guys, those guys <i>are</i> Philadelphia.

333
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,325
They bust their ass every
day just to get through.

334
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:18,329
And then, on a Sunday,
they put all their hopes into the Eagles.

335
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:23,267
And year after year after year,
their team lets them down.

336
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,468
And they get angry.

337
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:28,489
And that anger builds into a stone of fury.

338
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:31,359
And if it could just be released,

339
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:33,427
then we could feel something different.

340
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,429
What?

341
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:39,116
W-Well, then, you, me, us, those guys,

342
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:43,370
the whole city of Philadelphia
could feel like champions!

343
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:45,255
Frank.

344
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,524
You got to push that stone out right now.

345
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,126
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

346
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:50,394
- You can do it.
- I'll piss it out!

347
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:52,195
Do it for the Birds, Frank.

348
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:55,132
Do it for the whole city of Philadelphia,
man, push!

349
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,401
Brady,
with White to his right, takes the snap.

350
00:14:57,537 --> 00:15:00,071
Do it like Rocky, man. Push.

351
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,356
Brady back, steps up.
He's hit by Brandon Graham.

352
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:06,093
The ball is loose.

353
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:10,231
And the Eagles have it!
The Eagles have it.

354
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:12,232
It's recovered by Derek Barnett.

355
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,309
Brady lost the ball.

356
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,170
Looks like he couldn't see the defender.

357
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:19,312
It's-it's like something
was wrong with his eyes.

358
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:21,258
Brady fumbled. The Eagles recovered.

359
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:24,262
- You did it!
- Oh, no, Mac. We did it!

360
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:26,463
We did it! We did it! We did it.

361
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,266
We did it! We did it!

362
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,267
I don't know why you care, fair-weather fan.

363
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,681
Fair-weather fan.
You're from Minnesota, that's okay.

364
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,894
E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!

365
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:44,698
♪ Fly, Eagles, fly... ♪

366
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:45,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

367
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:47,835
- What?
- What're you singing about?

368
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:48,903
Oh, I'm over Tommy Fumbles.

369
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,905
I'm all about my man, Nick Foles!

370
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,658
Gross. You know, it doesn't matter.

371
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:55,926
Guys, I have an announcement to make.

372
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:57,861
I owe you an apology.

373
00:15:57,931 --> 00:16:01,932
You guys are true representations
of the city of Philadelphia.

374
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,869
And we came together as a city.

375
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:08,689
And, guys,
we helped the Eagles win the Super Bowl.

376
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,757
They won the Super Bowl!

377
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,960
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

378
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,763
Brady got the ball back,
and there's 58 seconds left in the game.

379
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,593
What did you do?!

380
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:20,034
You sons of bitches, this is your fault!
You screwed it up!

381
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,702
What're we gonna do? What do we do?

382
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,104
Do a superstition. Frank! Pee! Pee! Pee!

383
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:26,857
- Hey, I'm dry.
- Somebody do a superstition, quick!

384
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,660
Charlie!

385
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,795
<i>The Patriots with the ball
at their own nine yard line.</i>

386
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:33,896
Oh! Oh, Brady's got the ball.

387
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:34,999
- They are out of time outs.
- Wha-What?!

388
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,867
Brady's got the ball with time on the clock?

389
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,869
Oh, shit. What happened? What changed?

390
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:41,888
Yeah, you're gonna have
to get back in that trap.

391
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:43,757
- Yep.
- Aw, come on, man.

392
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:44,959
You just told me to get out of it.

393
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:47,094
Yeah, that was before Brady had the ball.

394
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:50,578
Ah. Does it have to be the same leg or...

395
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:51,832
- Same leg.
- Damn it!

396
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,834
Are you sure this is gonna work?

397
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:55,836
Every single thing that every fan does,

398
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,037
at home or at the stadium,

399
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:59,056
makes a direct impact in the game.

400
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,924
No, you're right.
I want to help you win.

401
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:02,126
Oh, I'm getting a call.

402
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,996
Let me think about this for a minute.

403
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,863
Hey, what's up, Mac?

404
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,733
Hey, Charlie, what's g...

405
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,601
Whoa, man, what the hell happened to you?

406
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,803
- It's a long story.
- All right.

407
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:13,871
Well, did you do your superstitions?

408
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,756
Brady's going to Gronk; we're screwed.

409
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,758
I got one thing left to do.

410
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,826
All right, well, you better hurry up, man.

411
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:20,027
I'm doing it. Here it goes.

412
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,696
He's backing up in the pocket!

413
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,697
He's back again. He steps up.

414
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,632
- Brady's backing up.
- He's hit. He stumbles.

415
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,968
- Do it, do it now!
- He's throwing!

416
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,971
He is going deep for the end zone,

417
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,657
and it is...

418
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:36,860
batted around...

419
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,997
and incomplete!

420
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:42,733
And the game is over.

421
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:46,937
We did it!

422
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,756
We did it! The superstitions are real!

423
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,625
Yes!

424
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:54,829
Charlie, you did it!

425
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:56,096
You did it, you were right.

426
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,032
The superstitions were real.
You did it, man!

427
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:03,904
What a tremendous Super Bowl.

428
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,791
It is still a mystery as to
what happened with Brady's eye,

429
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:09,727
but it had to have an effect
on his play late in the game.

430
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,595
What a win for the Eagles,

431
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:14,732
- and what a win for the city of Philadelphia.
- We did it!

432
00:18:54,957 --> 00:19:00,093
They did it! They did it!
They did it! They did it.

433
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:04,765
- It's over!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

434
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,700
- They did it!
- They did it!

435
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:09,770
Oh, my God, they did it!

436
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,767
