3
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:19,466
you doing?

4

DEE: I'm eating cake.

I can see that you're
eating cake, but that's Frank's

00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:24,397
cake from, like, a month ago.

7
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:25,371

Dee, you're eating
trash cake and smoking?

I mean, you know what
you look like?

13
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:32,219
You look like...

14
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:33,387
Like a bird?

15
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,656
Yeah. Yeah, of course you
look like a bird.

16
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:36,524
Yeah.

17
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:37,625
You always look like a bird.

18
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:39,373
But I was gonna say, uh,
you look like a...

19
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,661
Like a, like a bird lady
covered in bird shit

20
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:42,562
eating cake?

21

Dee, slow down, all right?

22
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:44,498
Yeah. Let the man do this.

23
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:45,431
Let me do my thing.

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
You're jumping on my thing here.

25

MAC: You know what she
looks like?

26
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,903
She looks like a bird
that has no...

27
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,838
A bird with no tits and no ass?

28
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,006
Dee, let us handle...

00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:53,874
Yeah.

32
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,642
She looks like...

33
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,510
Like a bird.

34
00:00:57,577 --> 00:00:58,377
That was it.

35
00:00:58,444 --> 00:00:59,177
Was that it?

36
00:00:59,245 --> 00:00:59,778
Ah...

37
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:00,846
That was it.

38
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:01,747
See? That would have
been funny, Dee.

39
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:02,681
Right. Yeah, Dee, don't...

40
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:03,509
What are you doing?

41
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:04,349
You know, that's not fun.

42
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:05,250
Stop. Stop whatever this is.

43
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:06,018
I don't like it.

44
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,119
I'm sorry, you guys.

45
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:07,786
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:08,494
Don't apologize.

47
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:09,254
That's just sad.

48
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:10,489
Fight back at us.

49
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:11,456
What's the point?

50
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,190
The joke's always on me,
all right?

51
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:14,358
I get it.

52
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,060
Yeah, but it's no fun
unless you fight back.

53
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:16,928
Yeah.

54
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:17,729
Yeah, I'm just gonna go home.

55
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:18,496
Good, go home.

56
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:19,430
I hope you, uh...

57
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:20,665
You hope I get hit by a bus?

58
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:21,566
Dee, come on, that's...

59
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:22,667
What difference does it make?

60
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,769
I can't get any lower than
I am already.

61
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:27,304
I might as well just throw
myself in front of a bus

62
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:30,073
though, because I'm so ugly
I can't even get a bus

63
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:30,674
to hit on me.

64
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:31,374
Well.

65
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:34,044
Geez.

66
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,932
What the hell was that
all about?

67
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,909
I'll tell you exactly what
that was.

Dee? Dee, are you dead?

70
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,276
Did you kill yourself,
Dee, or...?

71
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,244
Ah.

72
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:16,044
Dee, why is your door unlocked?

73
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,236
Do you realize how unsafe
that is?

74
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,471
Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,105
Okay, Dee, this is
truly pathetic, and you are

76
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:25,207
really bringing us down,
so we're gonna help you out.

77
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:29,542
We realize we may be in some
ways responsible for the

78
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:30,512
state you're in.

79
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,600
Yeah, all right, so we got an
idea though, okay?

80
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:34,801
We're gonna sign you up for an
open mic night at a

81
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:35,702
comedy club!

82
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,503
Yes.

83
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,604
Right? That's your thing!

84
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:39,105
And we're actually gonna support
you, Dee.

85
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:41,274
And now that you don't care
anymore, you're not gonna

86
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:42,676
gag on stage.

87
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,311
Yeah, you know, you're right
in that sweet spot between,

88
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:47,514
like, suicidal and actually
dead, where most comedians,

89
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,981
they thrive there.

90
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,917
Yeah, what was that thing you
said about how the joke's always

91
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:52,751
on you?

92
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,152
That could be a catchphrase.

93
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,355
Dee, look, I don't want to
pile on here, 'cause you're

94
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:57,956
clearly very close to killing
yourself...

95
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,291
Yeah.

96
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,293
...but I got to say, I
totally disagree with the guys

97
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,060
on this.

98
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,529
I'm glad you've given up.

99
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:06,431
And I want to propose something
totally different: I would like

100
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:08,065
to find you a man.

101
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,033
Come on.

102
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,063
Yeah. A man to settle
down with.

103
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,697
Now, I'm not talking about a
smart man, not-not

104
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,972
a handsome man,
but a very, very average if not

105
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,174
below average man to take you
off of our hands forever.

106
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:19,511
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

107
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:20,512
Go with it.

108
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,512
Go with it?

109
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,178
Which one?

110
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:23,246
You were not clear.

111
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,180
The thing. Whatever. Both.

112
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:24,948
I don't care.

113
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:25,937
Let's-let's do my plan.

114
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,650
The comedy plan.

115
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:27,751
Let's do our plan.

116
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,459
We're gonna do the comedy plan,
all right?

117
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:31,421
Meh.

118
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:40,730
(breathing into microphone)

119
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:49,553
(hushed): Dude, she is gonna

120
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:51,908
bomb so hard, and then she's
gonna feel worse.

121
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:52,709
(hushed): It's okay, dude.

122
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:54,705
She'll tell a couple jokes, and
then we'll, like, fake laugh

123
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:55,706
and stuff, you know?

124
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,674
And tomorrow we can shit
on her.

125
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:00,444
And she'll fight back and
be happy again.

126
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:03,014
Say something!

127
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:04,721
(listlessly): I decided
to stop showering.

128
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:06,550
(Frank laughs)
Too much, Frank, too much.

129
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:07,418
That's...

130
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:08,519
There was no joke told.

131
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:10,353
I just figured,
"What's the point?

132
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,155
I'm just a filthy person."

133
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:15,658
I passed out at the park the
other day, and a couple of kids

134
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:19,795
wrote, "Wash me" in the filth
on my vagina.

135
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:21,531
(laughter) Gross.

136
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:22,732
That was kind of funny, man.

137
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,720
That was kind of funny.

138
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:24,501
It was so gross.

139
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,534
It was gross.

140
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,302
Yeah, but that guy over
there laughed.

141
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,471
I guess, joke's on me.

142
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,340
(laughter)
There's the catchphrase.

143
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,241
Yeah, yeah! Ca...

144
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,208
Yeah, that's like a ca...

145
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:34,209
This is ridiculous.

146
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:36,345
I'm gonna go select some men
for Dee.

147
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:37,129
This is a waste of time.

148
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:40,477
Um, I stepped in front of a
bus, but it missed me.

149
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:43,245
I can't even get a bus
to hit on me.

150
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,715
(laughter) People are laughing!

151
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:46,616
We love it!

152
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:47,483
For real.

153
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:48,150
For real?

154
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,184
Yeah!

155
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:50,319
Knock, knock, knock.

156
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,988
Can we say hi? There she is!

157
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:52,989
Comedy star.

158
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:53,689
Dee <i>so</i> funny.

159
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:54,423
Really funny.

160
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:55,391
Oh, my God, so funny.

161
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,658
Great! It was
absolutely great!

162
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,793
You did the bus joke, and it
was like...

163
00:04:58,861 --> 00:04:59,794
They loved the catchphrase.

164
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:00,943
They loved the catchphrase!

165
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,003
And think about this, Dee.

166
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:03,065
You didn't even gag once.

167
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:03,932
Not one dry heave, nothing.

168
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,933
I guess I did pretty good.

169
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:05,734
Yeah, great!

170
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,102
"Pretty good," she said!

171
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,337
Dee, it was one of those shows
where you're, like, "Whoa!"

172
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:09,604
Oh, my goodness.

173
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:10,672
And then your brain
goes (makes explosion sound).

174
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,180
All right, guys,
will you stop, okay?

175
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,141
You're not helping.

176
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,275
Please, go get a drink,
all right?

177
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:15,043
Give us a second.

178
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,144
I need to talk to Dee.

179
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:16,977
We tried.

180
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:17,745
Yeah, you tried.

181
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,513
That was it.

182
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,514
Thanks, guys.

183
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:20,381
All right, listen,
listen to me.

184
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:21,682
Your set tonight was terrible.

185
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,017
It was atrocious.

186
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:24,485
Every single thing that came
out of your mouth was trash.

187
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,553
It was filth. It was disgusting.

188
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,221
That's what really happened,
okay?

189
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:28,656
I want to be very clear
about this.

190
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:31,324
Now, listen, I brought some men
for you to look at, all right?

191
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:32,259
I've got some selections.

192
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,660
Now, they're not great.

193
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:35,662
They're not, they're not anybody
to brag about, but, uh, you

194
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,130
know, they're men.

195
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:39,066
And they're probably willing to
spend their life with you, so...

196
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,567
Uh, hey, uh, sorry
to interrupt.

197
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,002
My name's Snyder, and I'm
a talent scout.

198
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,371
And I just caught your last set.

199
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,371
You were hilarious.

200
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,639
So I just wanted to give you
my card.

201
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:48,807
Give me a call.

202
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,742
No, she will not be calling
you, sir, okay?

203
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,677
Please do not encourage her.

204
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:52,844
Get out of here.

205
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:53,979
You're-you're interrupting my
work, all right?

206
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,914
You're not on my list
of chosen men.

207
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:56,715
Why would you be?

208
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:57,515
What are you...?

209
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:58,216
Christ.

210
00:05:58,284 --> 00:05:58,951
What are you doing?

211
00:05:59,018 --> 00:05:59,898
Why would you do that?

212
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,219
Come on, Dee.

213
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,454
That guy clearly just lurks
around these places pretending

214
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,723
to be a talent scout so he
can hit on women.

215
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,825
Now look-look at my selects,
all right?

216
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:07,960
Look at these guys, huh?

217
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,561
(Dee gasps) Yeah, I know.

218
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,428
This one's just, like, one
big chin.

219
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,263
Well, I didn't have a lot
to work with.

220
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,232
You know, here we are,
and look at you.

221
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,068
I mean, for Christ's sakes,
look.

222
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:18,102
Okay, I'm sorry.

223
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,536
Look, I want this to work,
I really do.

224
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:21,472
So I know I can do better,
all right?

225
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,773
Can you do better, all right?

226
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,642
I'm gonna be at your house
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

227
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,676
Have some new candidates
for you to look at, all right?

228
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:27,376
Okay.

229
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:28,411
This is gonna work.

230
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,412
<i>This</i> is not gonna work.

231
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,747
Let's get you cleaned up,
all right?

232
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,616
God, everything you did tonight
was so gross.

233
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,281
Dee, open up! Open!

234
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,382
You're locking your door
all of sudden?

235
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,330
What is that? Come on.

236
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,218
You care all of a sudden?

237
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:41,852
What? What?

238
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,619
Hey, let me in.

239
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:43,486
I got selections for you.

240
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:44,520
Now's not a good time.

241
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:45,789
I'm right in the middle
of something.

242
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:47,057
They're good selections.

243
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,625
Hey, it's the time I said,
so it's the time it'll be.

244
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,025
Now let me in. I got selects.

245
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,894
I don't care about
your selects.

246
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:52,594
Go!

247
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,422
What are you doing?

248
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:54,130
Are you hiding something?

249
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:54,864
No.

250
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:55,732
Is someone in there?

251
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,565
No, no. Don't worry about it.

252
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,714
Let me in or I'll barge in.

253
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,668
Hey, everything all right
over there, Dee?

254
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,070
Yeah, it's fine.

255
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,105
Oh, no.

256
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,606
Dee, oh... Oh!

257
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,606
Snyder?

258
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:06,374
Mm-hmm.

259
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,675
He's clearly using you.

260
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,778
Or you're using him to further
your nonexistent career.

261
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:10,779
I am not using him.

262
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:11,980
Oh, you're not using him?

263
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:12,814
Nope.

264
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:13,447
Oh, good, good, good, good.

265
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:14,196
So, you like him?

266
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:14,916
Mm-hmm.

267
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:15,616
Find him attractive?

268
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:16,918
Absolutely.

269
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,619
Describe the ways in which
you find him attractive.

270
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:22,156
(Dee scoffs)
He's got... he's got all of

271
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:23,857
his skin, still.

272
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:24,892
Well, I would hope so.

273
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,528
And that he has plenty of...

274
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,562
teeth to get...

275
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,697
But not all of them?

276
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,032
No, not all of them.

277
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,433
Hmm.

278
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,502
Dee, why can't you see that this
is the same pattern that you

279
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:36,703
always fall into?

280
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,737
Some guy uses you or you
use him.

281
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,139
And then you know what happens?

282
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,108
It's use, use, use, fail, fail,
fail, and then it's suicide.

283
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:44,343
You think you can't go any
lower?

284
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:45,344
Because you can.

285
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:46,545
Oh, yeah?

286
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,915
Well, he got me another gig for
tonight, boner.

287
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,183
What do you think of about that?

288
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,052
(making goofy noises)
What-what is that?

289
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,288
What are you... what are you
doing?

290
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:57,422
Sound effects.

291
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,390
Oh, goddamn, Dee.

292
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,326
You have no idea what's funny.

293
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,694
Don't do sound effects.

294
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,596
(Dee making goofy noises)
Don't do... don't... wh-what...

295
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:07,765
Oh, oh, oh.

296
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:13,938
Hey, hey, hey! Oh!

297
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,873
Hey, Dennis, oh, check this
place out.

298
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:16,974
This is legit.

299
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,009
Dude, dude, Dee's opening
for Landslide.

300
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:20,144
That guy's, like, the real deal.

301
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:21,345
I've never heard of him.

302
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:22,746
Mostly diarrhea jokes.

303
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,114
Yeah, he's the diarrhea guy,
but it look-looks like this

304
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:26,316
comedy stuff's paying off for
her.

305
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,550
Yeah, well...

306
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,018
Hey, you don't get a gig like
this by accident.

307
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:31,020
Oh, come on, don't get too
excited, all right?

308
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,056
She got the gig 'cause she's
banging some creep.

309
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,224
It's not gonna go well.

310
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,091
Who's the nerd?

311
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,459
Who, this guy? This is Walt.

312
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,494
Yeah, guy's got no self-esteem,
just like Dee, so they're

313
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:39,863
perfect for each other.

314
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,730
So after she bombs tonight, I'll
put them together, thereby

315
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:44,766
controlling the situation, and
her, as I always have and I

316
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,301
always will.

317
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,469
What?

318
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:49,139
Uh... Walt, just Walt-Walt's
the plan.

319
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:50,129
I'm Walt.

320
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:51,071
Yeah, shut up, Walt.

321
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,105
They know who you are.

322
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm sorry.

323
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,408
Ladies and gentlemen, Sweet
Dee Reynolds!

324
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,577
(crowd cheering) Sweet Dee!

325
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,350
(breathing into microphone)
Sweet Dee, joke's on you!

326
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,223
(laughter) She's got fans now?

327
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,624
Christ, come on.

328
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:17,396
So I finally broke down and I
took a shower the other day.

329
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:21,900
The stink flipped around and now
my soap smells like dirty vag.

330
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,135
(laughter)
She said "vagina."

331
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:25,370
A woman said "vagina."

332
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,072
That's what makes it funny!

333
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,072
Tasteless.

334
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,141
(robot voice): Vagina,
vagina.

335
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,376
Vagina, vagina.

336
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:36,647
(laughter) (making fart noises)

337
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,916
And the sound effects out of
absolutely nowhere, no setup.

338
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:39,917
But it's funny!

339
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,919
It's not funny, it's not funny.

340
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:42,953
It's funny, Dennis.

341
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:43,986
What are you doing?

342
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:44,954
Will you stop laughing, Walt?

343
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:46,055
Oh, my God, this is the worst.

344
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,990
People will laugh at absolutely
anything.

345
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,025
This is comedy?

346
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:53,096
(laughter)
So, men are just so hard.

347
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:55,865
Tell you what, they all walk
out on me.

348
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,467
Every one of them.

349
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,769
I can't even keep crabs in this
vagina.

350
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:03,505
(laughter)
They're all like, "Clickety

351
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:05,653
clackety, clickety clackety,
clickety clackety clack.

352
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:09,445
I got to get out of here!"
(robot voice): Evacuate vagina.

353
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:10,846
"Clickety clackety, clickety..."

354
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:14,850
(making machine gun noises)
The crabs have machine guns.

355
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,016
That makes sense.

356
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,453
All right, well, that's it
for me tonight.

357
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,756
I'd like to say it was fun, but
I've had a better time ripping

358
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,890
out my own pubes.

359
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,325
Shellac, shellac, rip!

360
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:28,363
(yelling wildly)
Ping, ping, ping, ow!

361
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,965
(laughter)
Okay, you guys, well, I'm Sweet

362
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,032
Dee, and the joke's on me!

363
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,270
(crowd cheering)
What is going on?

364
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:37,471
This is unbelievable.

365
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,906
Let's give it up for Landslide!

366
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:45,145
(crowd cheering)
Well, that was a funny white

367
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,347
bitch, wasn't it? (laughs)
Skinny though.

368
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,149
I took bigger dumps than her.

369
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:54,453
(making fart noises) (laughter)

370
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,822
It's a landslide!

371
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,923
Oh, my God.

372
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,858
I bet his diarrhea is nasty!

373
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,560
Nasty!

374
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,595
Oh, butts, vaginas and
diarrhea, great.

375
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,264
This is what the world's
come to.

376
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,933
(Charlie laughing) Hey, hey.

377
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,268
You're on the list?

378
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,969
The list? I'm-I'm Sweet Dee's
brother, so we're good.

379
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,138
Can't let you back there
unless you're on the list.

380
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,139
We got to be on that list.

381
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,441
This is fantastic.

382
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,109
I'm not on a list for a place
that I don't want to be.

383
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,210
You know how that feels?

384
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,378
Hey, Dee? Dee?

385
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,013
Uh, don't play this game, Dee.

386
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,816
I-I... We're five feet away from
you, I know you hear...

387
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:26,784
Deandra.

388
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:27,818
Dee. Dee.

389
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:28,819
Da.

390
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:29,820
Da.

391
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:30,788
Da.

392
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:31,789
Dah.

393
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:32,823
Dah.

394
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,792
Dah. Dah.

395
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:35,991
Dee. Dee.

396
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,892
(all chanting different
pronunciations of "Dee")

397
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,059
Yes, yes, yes. What? What?

398
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:41,027
Oh, hey.

399
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:42,194
Hi. What?

400
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:43,830
Hey, Dee, can we come back
there with you?

401
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:45,865
Yeah, hey, we're, like,
you're biggest fans, like, great

402
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,034
show, like, good job, like,
shut up, I'm sorry.

403
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,035
We're gonna start a fan club.

404
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:49,797
Oh, come on, stop kissing her
ass.

405
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:50,891
Dee, enough of this, okay?

406
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,453
Step over the rope and come meet
Walt.

407
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:53,508
Tell you what.

408
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:54,509
You three, you're in.

409
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:55,543
Dennis, you're out.

410
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,345
Go before she changes her
mind, go.

411
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,373
Hey! Faced! Thanks, Dee.

412
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:00,348
Dee, who do you think you are?

413
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,866
What is the matter with you,
Dennis?

414
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,843
You see them?

415
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,844
They're supporting me, okay?

416
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,144
Because they believe in me.

417
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:07,713
A fan club could really help
further my career.

418
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,381
Career? Oh, wow, Dee.

419
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:10,650
See, you don't have a career.

420
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,618
All right? So I need you to stop
all this right now.

421
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:13,686
It's gone too far.

422
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:14,687
Now, come meet Walt.

423
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:15,855
He is my select.

424
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,757
You know what I think this is
about, Dennis?

425
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:18,758
I think you're jealous.

426
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,592
I don't think you want me to
succeed.

427
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,627
Dee, let me be very clear
about something.

428
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,328
You will never succeed.

429
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:25,764
Ever.

430
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:28,099
Instead, you will fly too close
to the sun, and you will choke

431
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,601
and you will gag in a
spectacular manner.

432
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,038
So, please, for the love of God,
take Walt.

433
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:34,372
Hi, I'm Walt.

434
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,074
She knows your goddamn name,
Walt; I said it, like, a

435
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:36,807
thousand times.

436
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,808
Look, you know what?

437
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:39,576
I don't want to be with Walt,
okay?

438
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,378
And I don't want you to find me
a man.

439
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,814
What I need you to do is stay
out of my way, because Sweet Dee

440
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:46,983
is gonna be a star.

441
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:52,556
(making machine gun noises)
(laughter)

442
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:54,757
♪
♪ Oh.

443
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,514
(crowd cheering) All right!

444
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,516
Here, buddy, everyone else.

445
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:26,221
(laughter)
(making machine gun noises)

446
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:29,624
Right, I'm Sweet Dee, and the
joke's on me!

447
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,093
Thank you very much.

448
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,427
Good night.

449
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:35,095
(crowd cheering wildly)

450
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,214
I don't care that you only have

451
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:40,103
one mic.
Look at me!

452
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,004
Dee Reynolds does not use mics
that other so-called comedians

453
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,178
have spit into, okay?

454
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:45,832
So get another one.

455
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,933
Dee Reynolds?

456
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:47,967
Mm-hmm.

457
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,001
Hi, I'm Michael Rotenberg.

458
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,549
I'm a talent manager from Los
Angeles.

459
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:51,613
I've heard a lot about you.

460
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,138
Oh, hi. Well...

461
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,974
I've got a proposition for you.

462
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,282
One of my bigger clients is
supposed to do <i>Conan</i> tomorrow

463
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,577
night, and something came up.

464
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,179
They need to fill the spot,
and I brought your name up.

465
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:02,715
Are you interested?

466
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:04,816
Conan O...

467
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:05,850
Conan O'Brien?

468
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,218
Yeah.

469
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,686
I would love to represent you,
too; I think you're amazing.

470
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:11,155
I can fly you to L.A. tomorrow
on my private jet, and we can go

471
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:12,156
straight <i>Conan.</i>

472
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,190
What do you say?

473
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:14,358
Uh, well, my goodness.

474
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,061
This is all... This is all...

475
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,030
This is all... (gags)
This is all... (gags)

476
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:20,998
Oh, boy, hold on.

477
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,565
Uh, you okay?

478
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

479
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:26,036
It's just, uh, just had a
little piece of sausage.

480
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,337
Okay, I'm sure you did.

481
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,524
Um, now, I'm not stepping on
anyone's toes here, am I?

482
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,642
Do you already have
representation?

483
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:32,609
Representation? No.

484
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,678
Hey, sweetheart, there you are.

485
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:35,679
Ew! Mm-mm.

486
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:36,548
Who the hell's that?

487
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:37,880
This is, uh, my new manager.

488
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:38,981
What?

489
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,750
Sorry, Snyder, I don't need
you anymore.

490
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,985
This guy's taking me to
Hollywood on a private jet.

491
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:43,986
What? Hollywood!

492
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:44,954
Hollywood!

493
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,022
We're going to Hollywood!

494
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,056
No, no, no!

495
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:48,424
<i>We're</i> not going anywhere.

496
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,059
There's plenty of room if you
want to take your friends.

497
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,027
There's no room, okay?

498
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:52,511
I have no use for you guys
anymore.

499
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:54,517
Hey, what do you say we go
back to my hotel and have sex?

500
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:55,603
Absolutely.

501
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,638
Screw you, guys.

502
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:57,752
What the hell, Dee?!
We made you!

503
00:14:57,823 --> 00:14:59,357
I'm sorry, you made me?!

504
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:01,209
You made me?!

505
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,429
I made you!

506
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:03,997
Screw you guys, all right?

507
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,966
(making goofy noises) Oh.

508
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:19,928
- Here we go.
- Okay.

509
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:20,709
You excited?

510
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:21,309
Am I excited?

511
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:22,744
Y... yes, I am.

512
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:23,411
Yes, I...

513
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,312
Dee, wait, wait.

514
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,747
Wait.

515
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:27,082
I made a mistake.

516
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,784
All this time, I've been
searching for the perfect guy to

517
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,619
take you off of my hands
forever, but... I realized

518
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,920
something.

519
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:37,458
The perfect guy's been under my
nose the entire time.

520
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,894
It's me, Dee.

521
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:41,863
I'm the perfect select.

522
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,865
I know, I've spent my entire
life shitting all over your

523
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,133
dreams, and not supporting you,
but I was wrong, Dee.

524
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,902
I see that now.

525
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,704
You can succeed.

526
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,939
You <i>will</i> be a star.

527
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:54,541
You have to take me.

528
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:57,878
I'm your twin brother.

529
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,880
I love you, Dee.

530
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:06,084
Dennis...

531
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:08,521
suck my dick.

532
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:12,858
(Dennis grunting) Wait.

533
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:13,859
Dee!

534
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:15,293
No, wait, Dee, wait!

535
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:16,629
Don't do this, Dee!

536
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,130
Dee, wait!

537
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,497
Dee, stop!

538
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:20,932
Don't fly away now!

539
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,299
Dee, wait!

540
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,869
Wait!

541
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:27,572
So when we get to L.A.,
you're going straight into the

542
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,907
limo and right to <i>Conan.</i>

543
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:30,642
I'm gonna whisk you right
backstage, and we go straight

544
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:31,409
on.

545
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,516
This is the big-time, Dee.

546
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:33,745
You're not in Philadelphia
anymore, okay?

547
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:35,145
Mm-hmm.

548
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:36,112
People are gonna be screaming
your name, there's gonna be

549
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,847
paparazzi.

550
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:38,181
Papa... whew.

551
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:39,082
(gagging): Paparazzi, huh?

552
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,050
Yes.

553
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:40,951
I tipped them off.

554
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,452
It's all about image.

555
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,486
It's great!

556
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:44,555
It's all great.

557
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:45,989
It's all super sudden though,
isn't it?

558
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,791
(gags) Ooh.

559
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:49,459
There's a real smell to
that one.

560
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:50,193
Yeah, that...

561
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:50,960
Are you okay?

562
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:51,727
That one was... came...

563
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:52,595
started deep, that's all.

564
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:53,729
This is your moment, Dee.

565
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,064
(Dee sighs)
If you nail this, we're talking

566
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,266
sitcoms, movie deals, the whole
nine yards.

567
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,100
Yeah.

568
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,035
So let's get focused.

569
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,036
Yes.

570
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:00,836
All right.

571
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:01,837
Yeah.

572
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:02,872

00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:08,492

641
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,994

00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:10,995
Yeah!

643
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:12,162
You banged that guy!

644
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,497
(laughter) Hey, best part?

645
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,133

00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,036
I was and I wasn't.

648
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,137
He wasn't, he wasn't.

00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:22,538
No, no, no.

650
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:23,940
No, we knew we had to drag him
through the mud, make it seem

651
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:24,741
legit.

652
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:25,642
It was great, it was great.

653
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,676
The joke's on him, too!

654
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:27,777
Yeah, joke's on him!

655
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,112
(noisemakers blare)
Well, it was good.

656
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:29,778
It was a good joke.

657
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:30,613
It was a good joke.

658
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,413
Good joke, guys, I love jokes.

659
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,247
She's got more to say.

660
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:33,015
Oh.

661
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:33,782
She's got more to say.

662
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,250
Why would you do this?

663
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:37,285
Oh, well, you know, you were
being all mopey and annoying...

664
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:38,286
Yeah.

665
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:39,554
...complaining and stuff.

666
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:41,389
We wanted to show you that
you could sink lower.

667
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:42,891
Talking about killing
yourself, ugh.

668
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,994
Some things you just don't
joke about, okay?

669
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:45,742
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:46,427
You took it too far.

671
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,128
Right.

672
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:47,829
Too far.

673
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:48,663
Yeah.

674
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,098
I took it too far?

675
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:51,099
That's what I said.

676
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,901
Oh... I took... I took it
too far?

677
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:59,706
Oh, God, you sons of bitches!

678
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:05,211
(roaring) And there she goes!

679
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,246
She's back!

680
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:08,048
(laughter)
I... no!

681
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,117
All right, so we got Dee
back, and I think we may have

682
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:11,951
broke Dennis.

683
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:12,785
Broke me?

684
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:13,819
Nah, come on, I'm good.

685
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,287
(laughs) I love all this.

686
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:16,288
This is great.

687
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:18,323
I'm gonna pop out for a little
while.

688
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,960
(laughing) He's not loving it.

689
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:21,661
He's not.

690
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:22,928
He's not loving it.

691
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,663
No, he's not. (yells)
He might go kill himself.

692
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,865
(noisemakers blare)

693
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:40,612
