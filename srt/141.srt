1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,703
<i>- Where is it? It was right here.</i>
- _

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,772
- <i>I cannot find it. And by the way, Mac,</i>
- _

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,506
- <i>what're you even talking about?</i>
- _

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,441
The word is superstition,
not "stupid-stition."

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,443
I know what the word is, Charlie.

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:16,381
I'm saying your green man
suit is a stupid superstition.

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,934
Oh, really?
Then why do the Eagles keep winning?

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,201
Also, by the way, dude,

9
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,404
uh, you're a Cowboys fan,
so shut the hell up.

10
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,805
I'm not a Cowboy fan, I'm a Tony Romo fan.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,340
And he retired, so now I bleed green.

12
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,675
- Go, Birds! Go, Birds!
- All right, well, I'm not

13
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,477
going to the Super Bowl without it.
I got to find it.

14
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,412
Yeah, don't make us late,
Charlie, all right?

15
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:32,414
I-If you can't find it,
you can't find it, you know?

16
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,566
The-the fans have no effect on
the outcome of the game, anyway.

17
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,368
- Do you know how football works?
- Yes.

18
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,237
That's right, your voodoo bullshit
is not gonna mean anything if...

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,705
Wh-What's going on with your eye?

20
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,574
Uh, nothing, I got a,
I think I got an eyelash in it.

21
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,576
Well, you're, like,
scratching it, and it's blinking.

22
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,178
I just, I slept on it funny.

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,912
What the hell is the holdup here?

24
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,313
Frank, this is why

25
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,600
I wanted total control
over the guest list, all right?

26
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:54,069
The eyes of the world are
gonna be on Philadelphia,

27
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,672
and I want to show them that we
are not just degenerates, okay?

28
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:00,875
And that is why I'm very
nervous about these guys.

29
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:02,778
Chug! Chug! Chug!

30
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,879
Chug! Chug! Chug!

31
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:05,280
Hey.

32
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,481
Chug! Oh!

33
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,566
Do me a favor, hold that corner right there.

34
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,769
- What's this?
- Uh, I got to put up a sign.

35
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,238
I want people to know
we're closed for salmonella

36
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,839
because of the Super Bowl.

37
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,908
Okay. First of all,

38
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:19,644
how is "salmonella"
the only word you spelled correctly?

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,513
And second of all, which is it?
Are we closed for salmonella,

40
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,581
or are we closed 'cause of the Super Bowl?
It's very confusing.

41
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,734
- Look, do me a favor? Okay? Just go find green man.
- Yep.

42
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,536
Please? Please, thank you.

43
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,739
- Charlie. Here, eat this asparagus.
- What?

44
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:32,274
No, I can't eat that right now.
That-That's not right.

45
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:33,408
It's not part of my rituals.

46
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:35,009
Okay, do you know what's not right...

47
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,011
is that we are trying to start a family,

48
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,080
- and you're not taking it very seriously.
- Okay, no, I hear you,

49
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,832
but what I need to take seriously right now

50
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,966
is the Super Bowl, okay?

51
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,568
And that means sticking to my color system.

52
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,837
All right? I<i> wear</i> green. I don't eat it.

53
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,639
I'm green man. I eat brown,

54
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,975
preferably, uh, milksteak
with a little light char to it.

55
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,776
And I drink yellow, because beer is yellow,

56
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,845
and that is what has been
working all season long!

57
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,980
- Oh, my God.
- I don't want to talk about this right now.

58
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,933
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where're you going?
- Huh?

59
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,000
Got to find green man.

60
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,524
Why does no one understand this?

61
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,138
Nobody cares about your
stupid superstitions.

62
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,140
- Dude, just get off my back, all right? Let me find it.
- No.

63
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,676
Man, look, I just wish one time

64
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,811
you would not make everything so difficult.

65
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,129
Yeah, and you know what?

66
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:12,680
Sometimes I wish you'd just disappear.

67
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:16,634
Yo, check it out. I got one last surprise.

68
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,842
This is very nice.

69
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,911
Party bus!

70
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,846
- No way.
- Fully stocked.

71
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,401
- There it is!
- You found it! - MAC: All right.

72
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:35,470
- You found the damn suit. Can we go now?
- Nice.

73
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,639
Where the hell is green man?!

74
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:40,742
Where is it?!

75
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,013
Well, I just can't find it,
so I'm gonna have to, like,

76
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,348
buy a new one on the way up there.

77
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,966
Who knows if it's even
gonna have the same powers

78
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,434
as the other one did. I...

79
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,437
Where is everybody?

80
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,372
Guys?

81
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,718
_

82
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,303
Honey?

83
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,639
Hello?

84
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,842
Mac?

85
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,244
Dee?

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,213
Frank?

87
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,936
I made my friends disappear.

88
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:45,807
I made my friends disappear!

89
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,774
Hey, Frank!

90
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,311
I'm going through your stuff!

91
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,867
Hey, Mac!

92
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:15,337
I'm going through your stuff!

93
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,672
I got your...

94
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,007
sticky Bible!

95
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,943
Dee!

96
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:24,011
I'm going through your stuff!

97
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,567
Dee, woof!

98
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,414
I don't know why I'm screaming.
This doesn't hurt at all.

99
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,602
Countdown to the game. And start the clock.

100
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,405
E-A-G-L-E-S!

101
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:53,074
Eagles! All right, boys.

102
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,943
I'm home alone in the bar, you know?

103
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,145
It's all me. This is, like, my bar now.

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,765
Hey, cheers to you
and the big game, boys, right?

105
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,167
Really cool, too, man.

106
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,302
Those, like, those uniforms
look really cool on you.

107
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,504
You guys look, like, really strong.

108
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,977
I am a little bored.

109
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,700
What the heck?

110
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,836
Hello?

111
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,806
Hello?

112
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:26,808
Mac?

113
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:29,677
Dee?

114
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,679
Frank?

115
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,882
Is this a joke?

116
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,635
Cricket?

117
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,237
Uncle Jack?

118
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,731
Is this a joke?

119
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,909
It's only my imagination.

120
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,646
It's only my imagination.
It's only my imagination.

121
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,405
Okay.

122
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,141
So, he tries to punch me. He misses.

123
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:02,076
- Oh.
- He misses. What an idiot, huh?

124
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:02,866
Yeah.

125
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,679
I got it.

126
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,037
- Hey, idiot.
- What?

127
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,973
Read the sign.

128
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,976
"Closed for salmonella because Super Bowl."

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,778
Well, which one is it?
Is it closed for salmonella,

130
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,712
- or is it closed for the Super Bowl?
- I don't know.

131
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,447
Burglars.

132
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,268
Thi-This is my bar.

133
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,538
I have to defend it.

134
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,676
Ah, I know.

135
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:19,555
_

136
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,166
Ooh, ooh, that's a gusher.

137
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,034
I got to stop the bleeding.

138
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,170
Help! Help!

139
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:56,841
Oh, shit.

140
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,845
Uh, okay. Okay.

141
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,407
Oh, God. Oh, this is gonna suck.

142
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,411
Oh! Shit!

143
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,732
Okay.

144
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,907
It's time for the Super Bowl.
Super Bowl.

145
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,645
Oh, man.

146
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:56,601
What?

147
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,271
How is the game starting? Uh...

148
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,740
How did I lose an entire day?!

149
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,009
Oh, shit, I got to get the TV on!

150
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,748
Oh, shit. Hey, uh, help?

151
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,167
Oh, who am I kidding, man?

152
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,503
No one's gonna leave their TVs right now.

153
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:20,308
My colors.

154
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:23,044
I-I didn't do my color rituals. Guys,

155
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,246
you're gonna lose the game because of me!

156
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:27,315
I'm so sorry I let you guy...

157
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,600
I let you guys down, man. I didn't...

158
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,361
Oh, I blew it.

159
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,838
It's gonna be my fault.

160
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,013
Hey. Hey there, fella. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

161
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,112
Be careful.
Don't-don't... don't go by the traps.

162
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:46,300
Don't... Come here, come here, come here.

163
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,703
Come here, come here, come here.
Come here. I got you.

164
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,078
You're gonna be okay.

165
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,440
'Cause I know what it's like
to be caught in a trap now,

166
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,041
and it's not okay.

167
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,777
I won't let you get caught in a trap, okay?

168
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,647
You're so cute and tiny and...

169
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:02,233
and brown.

170
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,438
Healthy-looking fellow, huh?

171
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:21,101
Ah. The brown is down.

172
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,438
The brown is down.

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,039
Wasn't too bad.

174
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,510
Eagles must have scored. It's working!

175
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,779
All right. All right, let's get that TV on.

176
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,267
I ate my brown, and it worked!

177
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,470
I ate my brown!

178
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,811
Although I got a feeling that's gonna
come back to haunt me later.

179
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,348
No, right now.

180
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,372
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever eat a rat.

181
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,873
Oh, man, that sounds
like the Pats scored, huh?

182
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,609
Okay, I-I just got to keep
going with my colors, right?

183
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,812
All right, that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm-I'm gonna keep going.

184
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,747
I'm gonna... I'm gonna wear green.

185
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,099
I'm gonna drink yellow. All right.

186
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:26,834
Green. What's-what's green? What's green?

187
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,437
What can I...?

188
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,838
Okay, I got it.

189
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,573
Okay, boys, I got it.

190
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,975
Here's the play.

191
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm not gonna let you fellas down.

192
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:38,379
I'm gonna untie my shoes,

193
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,381
I'm gonna toss them over the rope.

194
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,134
That's gonna lower that
green paint can down to me.

195
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,478
Shoes goes up.

196
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,681
Soar like an Eagle!

197
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,566
Aah! Okay, boys,

198
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,502
I'm not gonna let you down.

199
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:04,438
Soar like an Eagle! Yeah!

200
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:16,401
Oh, shit.

201
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,736
Okay, plan B.

202
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,874
Oh, no. Okay.

203
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:24,675
Bear with me.

204
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,543
All right.

205
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,346
Let's chew through this bad boy.

206
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,814
I'm gonna chew through it.

207
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:36,904
There we go. Okay.

208
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,307
Here we go.

209
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,378
Oh, no.

210
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,979
All right.

211
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,647
I'm just gonna have to catch it.

212
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:47,785
One...

213
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,934
two...

214
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,102
three.

215
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,371
Okay, I'm green.

216
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,908
That's...

217
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,242
Nice. Sounds like it's working.

218
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,577
All right.

219
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:17,903
Got to get some yellow.

220
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,349
Got to get some yellow!
Got to drink some beers, boys!

221
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,409
I'm coming, beer!

222
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,212
I'm gonna get my yellow!

223
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,704
Oh, shit!

224
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,506
I'm stuck.

225
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,101
Oh!

226
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,098
Not enough yellow!

227
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,802
Where the hell am I gonna get some yellow?

228
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,908
Oh, God.

229
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,677
Oh, God.

230
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:43,547
Oh, this is awful.

231
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,234
<i>You can do it, Charlie.
You drink that yellow.</i>

232
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,502
You got us here!

233
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:49,904
Now finish what you started.

234
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,239
Whoa. Hey, dudes.

235
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,974
Finish your color rituals.

236
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,309
Okay. Here goes!

237
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,778
Go, Eagles!

238
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:01,531
Oh, that was rough.

239
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,666
Now turn on that TV.

240
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,734
Yeah!

241
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,336
Oh!

242
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,939
I don't think I can get there, boys.

243
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,140
You watched every game this season...
you can't miss

244
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,474
the end of the most important one.

245
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,675
Oh, come on, man.

246
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,677
I did the color rituals. Isn't that enough?

247
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,346
The only reason the Eagles made it this far

248
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,081
is because of your superstitions.

249
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,500
The rituals.
They say you're caught in a bear trap.

250
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,301
They say you lost two quarts of blood.

251
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,570
They say you're hallucinating!

252
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,904
Who's "they"?

253
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,506
Everyone who didn't believe in you.

254
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,708
And I got two words for them: (bleep) 'em!

255
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,578
- Right!
- You've got this, Charlie. You're an Eagle.

256
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,512
- Yeah!
- Now go turn on that TV!

257
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,399
Yeah! Here I go!

258
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,600
- Yeah, come on, Charlie. You got this.
- Come on, Charlie.

259
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,873
- Come on, Charlie. Come on!
- Pull that chain! Pull it!

260
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,253
Yeah!

261
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,946
- Come on, Charlie. You can do this, baby.
- Let's go.

262
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,948
Oh, glass!

263
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,300
- I stepped right on the glass!
- Yeah,

264
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:54,702
- but keep pushing, man.
- No pain, no gain!

265
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,237
Okay. I got it.

266
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,315
- Oh!
- Oh!

267
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:02,709
I forgot about that one!

268
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,578
Why would anybody do that to anybody?

269
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:06,635
Fight through it.
Fight through the pain!

270
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,866
- Come on, come on.
- Move, move.

271
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,262
Oh, I forgot...

272
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,120
- Oh!
- Shit!

273
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,782
Come on, man. You got it. You took
that one, eh? Keep going, Charlie.

274
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,076
- Come on, Charlie.
- Pull that chain!

275
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,277
- Pull that chain! Pull that chain!
- I am pulling,

276
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,146
- you big fat assholes!
- Pull that chain!

277
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,747
There's some slack in here. Pull it.

278
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,299
There you go.

279
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,567
Come on, Charlie.

280
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,569
I can't do it!

281
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:31,571
I can't do it.

282
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,041
No, no, it's too hard.

283
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,310
No, the trap. It was designed for animals.

284
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,778
Yeah. So?

285
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,047
You're a human, dude.

286
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:41,999
Use your thumbs.

287
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,201
- What do you mean, use my thumbs?
- There's a release lever

288
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,404
on the bottom. Thumbs.

289
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,606
What?!

290
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,742
Well, why didn't you tell me
there was a release lever?!

291
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,744
You bought the trap, Charlie.

292
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,481
I only know about the release lever
because<i> you</i> know about the release lever.

293
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,166
Y-You get that, right?

294
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,436
Yeah, no, I-I totally get that.

295
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,104
- He's not getting it.
- We're-we're not real. - No, I get it.

296
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:07,240
Quick question: where is the release lever?

297
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,976
- It's on the bottom!
- It's on the bottom!

298
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,244
- The bottom of the trap.
- Yeah. You set it up.

299
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,247
I see it. Okay.

300
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,466
Oh!

301
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,338
Patriots with the ball at their own

302
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,207
- nine yard line.
- Oh!

303
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,076
Oh, Brady's got the ball. The ball... What?!

304
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,811
Brady's got the ball
with time on the clock!?

305
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,014
Oh, shit, what happened? What changed?

306
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,565
Yeah... you're gonna

307
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:32,900
- have to get back in that trap.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,103
Aw, come on, man.
You just told me to get out of it.

309
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,372
Yeah, that was before Brady had the ball.

310
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,441
Does it have to be the same leg or...

311
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,710
- Yeah.
- Same leg. - Damn it!

312
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:44,712
Are you sure this is gonna work?

313
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,714
Every single thing that every fan does,

314
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:50,267
at home or at the stadium,
makes a direct impact in the game.

315
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,936
Aw... shit.

316
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,572
