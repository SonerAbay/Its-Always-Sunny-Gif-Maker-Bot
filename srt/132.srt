1
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:05,227
_

2
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:07,054
_

3
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:13,211
Stop! Thief!

4
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:14,679
Come back here!

5
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,261
Come back here!

6
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:52,285
What the hell?

7
00:00:58,089 --> 00:00:59,458
Shit.

8
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,384
You're nothing but a street rat!

9
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,597
I may be a street rat,

10
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,767
but I still got your bread, bitch.

11
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,838
Excuse me, excuse me, are you, um...

12
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm the suck boy you're looking for.

13
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,842
You want my time,
you got to pay to spray.

14
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,845
That's my motto.
That and you cannot finish inside me.

15
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:23,215
No, no, no, Matt. It's me.

16
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:26,786
Dad?

17
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,054
It's time to come home, son.

18
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:55,652
You want me to come work for you?

19
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:57,953
Well, I want you to learn the business.

20
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,690
I'm not getting any younger.

21
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:02,291
It's time for me to pass the torch.

22
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,194
- Oh, shit.
- What?

23
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:05,361
- You're dying.
- What?

24
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,963
I-I figured. You look like hell.

25
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,465
Hey, has anyone claimed your organs?

26
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,035
I'm not dying, you idiot.

27
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:13,969
I'm retiring.

28
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,304
Oh. My bad.

29
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:16,573
I had to ask.

30
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,041
It's a seller's market right now.

31
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,342
Look what you've become.

32
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,143
Do you want to live this way, son?

33
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:24,047
Covered in manure, selling your body,

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,583
smoking PCP or whatever it is you smoke.

35
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,086
Oh, come on.

36
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,886
Do I look like a dusthead to you?

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,888
You certainly don't look like my son.

38
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,758
Matthew Mara. You remember him?

39
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,059
Come on.

40
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:39,929
Give the job a shot, for Christ's sake.

41
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,531
I'll think about it.

42
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,366
I got to pop in here first.

43
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:47,336
You don't have to go into
a dive bar right now.

44
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,539
I'm just gonna clean myself up.

45
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:50,773
Have a little faith.

46
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:52,342
My friends have a very nice setup

47
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:54,910
for me to take a shower in here.

48
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:57,914
In fact, I'm the type of gal
who makes men's lives better.

49
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:01,521
Hey-o! You guys mind if I shower
in that leaky urinal again?

50
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,521
Well, that... don't count that.

51
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,554
That's not a good example.

52
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:07,923
Ah!

53
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,062
Eh. While I'm here, I might as well...

54
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,099
do a little P to the C to the P.

55
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,804
Take me to the angels, baby.

56
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:32,214
<i>It's time to come home, son.</i>

57
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:34,917
Maybe it's time to make a change.

58
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,169
All right, uh, this is the loading dock

59
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,770
where we, uh, ship our supplies from.

60
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,772
And right here...

61
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,141
this is you.

62
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:59,642
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

63
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:00,810
This is nice.

64
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,279
I'm gonna sleep well tonight.

65
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,146
No, no. You're not gonna
sleep there. Come on.

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,982
Get out. Get out of the damn box.

67
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:08,185
You're gonna sleep at home in a bed.

68
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,952
- Oh. Eh, too exposed.
- Yeah.

69
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,100
No. I-I'll sleep in, uh,
maybe the crawlspace

70
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,685
- or a cupboard.
- This is bullshit.

71
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,991
Hey, hey, hey, Davy, Davy.

72
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,961
- Calm down, Davy.
- He's a homeless junkie, Dad.

73
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,029
I don't even understand
why we're doing this.

74
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,963
- He's just gonna burn you again.
- All right.

75
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:23,532
- When did I ever burn Dad?
- You stole his identity.

76
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,000
- Eight times!
- Well, at least

77
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:27,137
I didn't wet the bed till
I was in high school.

78
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,370
Shut your mouth about that.

79
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:29,873
- Whatever, Davy Diapers.
- I will kill you.

80
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,441
- Try it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

81
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:32,509
Come on! Take it back!

82
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,510
You want another noogie?

83
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,678
All right, all right, boys.

84
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:35,845
Boys! Stop it!

85
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:37,947
His scalp came off on my fingers.

86
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,382
Goddamn it.

87
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,051
Now look here, guys.

88
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:44,120
We have an important meeting coming up.

89
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,289
It's our biggest account.

90
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,557
And I'm gonna tell them

91
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,893
that my boys
are taking over the business.

92
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,395
Both of them.

93
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:55,498
You guys need to get your shit together.

94
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:58,168
Got it? Huh?

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,835
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. Yes.

96
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:02,339
All right.

97
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:05,976
I got my eye on you, loser.

98
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,910
And you stink like piss, by the way.

99
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,047
It's freakin' bullcrap.

100
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,186
What a jerk.

101
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:20,022
Huh?

102
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,858
Oh. Yeah.

103
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,225
He's always been a hard-on.

104
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,060
He's the one who stinks, by the way.

105
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,664
His shoes smell like rotten eggs.

106
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:28,865
You smell his shoes?

107
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:31,066
Yeah. He kicks at me

108
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,701
if he catches me sleeping at work.

109
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,737
Calls me a bitch, that kind of thing.

110
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,872
Yeah. He treats me like shit, too.

111
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,541
Sorry. I didn't get your name.

112
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,075
Oh. I'm Belle.

113
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,710
Thus the necklace my mother gave me

114
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:43,946
that I'm currently guilt-wearing.

115
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:45,684
Belle.

116
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,649
That's a nice name.

117
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,419
I'm Cricket, uh, Matthew.

118
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:50,786
It's nice to meet you, Matthew.

119
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:54,890
Hey, date!

120
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:57,459
Um, I'm sorry. What?

121
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,762
Shit. Sorry. Um,

122
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:02,866
haven't done this in a long time. Uh...

123
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,534
would you like to go on
a date with me some time?

124
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,437
Yeah. Yeah, I... I'd like that.

125
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,138
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:12,976
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

127
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:18,869
Okay.

128
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,460
Hey, boss?

129
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:28,496
- You go by Cricket?
- I do.

130
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,796
Phone's for you. Line two.

131
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,032
Oh, really?

132
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,705
- Mm. Hello.
- Cricket!

133
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,508
Oh. Cricket.

134
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,145
Damn it! How the hell
did you guys find me?

135
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:45,678
A magician never
reveals his tricks, Cricks.

136
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:47,414
Yeah. We did put that
pet-tracking device in him.

137
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,015
Well, wait. Don't tell him that.

138
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,485
Wait. You did what? Wait.
Did you put a chip in...?

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,419
Did you put a chip in me?!

140
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:54,854
Nothing, Cricket. Hey, listen,
um, we got a job for you, buddy.

141
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:57,258
Oh, do you? Well, uh, I'm not doing it.

142
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,993
- Well, you don't even know what it is.
- Hey! Yeah. Come on, man.

143
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,493
- You don't know what the job is, Cricket.
- You don't know the job.

144
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:02,596
Doesn't matter. I know
it probably involves hurting me,

145
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,564
degrading me or generally
treating me like shit.

146
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,900
- You're not totally wrong. Yeah.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,037
- Cricket, uh, we'll give you five bucks, huh?
- Yeah, five dollars, Cricket.

148
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,505
The answer is no.

149
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,907
All right. Fine. Three dollars.

150
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,175
Well, you don't go down in negotiation.

151
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:15,443
- You go up.
- With Cricket, you do.

152
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,661
Well, now it's $2.50, Crick,
so you want the job or not?

153
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,782
- You know, ticktock.
- Uh, look, guys, um,

154
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,852
I got a new life,
so I don't need anything from you.

155
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:25,821
- Ugh. Come on. Hey.
- Well, Cricket,

156
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,688
- everybody needs a little extra cash.
- Yeah. It's money, Cricket!

157
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,358
Well, uh, actually, that is true,

158
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,593
because I... I do have a date.

159
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,362
- Oh. Cricket. Cricket.
- Ah. Well, don't make up a story.

160
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:38,231
I mean, yeah, we don't care what
you're doing with the money.

161
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:39,967
Hey, dipshit!

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,436
We're not paying you
to talk on the phone.

163
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,439
Speaking of, I need some cash.
When do we get paid?

164
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,808
Paychecks come at the end of the month.
Who you talking to, huh?

165
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,309
Your drug dealer?

166
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:52,146
Your skeezy little arrogant
douche bag friends down at the bar?

167
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,815
- Those guys are my friends!
- Whatever!

168
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,618
I am so onto you.

169
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:02,455
And I bet you're gonna be
high by the end of the night.

170
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,830
Ooh!

171
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:11,966
Freakin' bullcrap!

172
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:13,129
He's getting yelled at.

173
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,436
Well, don't piss off your trick there,
Cricket. He might

174
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:16,936
- cut you up.
- Yeah, just

175
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,906
finish the guy off,
and then come do the job for us.

176
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,274
- Yeah.
- All right, what's it gonna be?

177
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,808
We need a decision, Cricket.

178
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,444
Mm...

179
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,313
Are we ready to party tonight?

180
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,521
So am I!

181
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,321
- Dad?
- Oh! Janie? Oh!

182
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:36,757
Let's just have a good
time and get drunk, huh?

183
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,492
Stuff it down with some brown.

184
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,993
Stuff it down with brown.

185
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:43,189
- Can always stuff it down.
- Hey, good job, fellas.

186
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:45,115
I loved how you ruined that dad.

187
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,767
Ah. I got to say, it's kind of fun

188
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,835
being on the other end
of it sometimes, huh?

189
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,772
Okay, time to pay the piper.
Who's got the money?

190
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:52,705
- Yes.
- Oh, uh, Frank.

191
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,041
Lemons.

192
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:58,012
What? No. N-No, okay? No, you're not
paying me in lemons again.

193
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,847
Okay? Hey, we had an agreement.

194
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,948
You want to get paid in PCP, Cricket?
'Cause you're just

195
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,784
- gonna spend it on drugs anyway, right?
- Oh, yeah, skip the middleman.

196
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:05,219
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah. You want some dust?

197
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:07,454
No. Okay, normally, okay?

198
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,823
But now I'm off drugs,
and I actually have a date,

199
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:12,025
so I need the money,
I really need the money.

200
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,161
Look, Cricket, I'm sure whatever
street mongrel you're dating...

201
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,330
she's into lemons, too, so you're good.

202
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,532
Goddamn it. Goddamn you,
you are the worst person ever.

203
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:21,468
And by the way,
my name is not Cricket, okay?

204
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,137
My name is Matthew Mara.

205
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:27,007
I'm a person. A person, by the way,
who has a job now.

206
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,877
Yeah. I am going to be running
a company soon.

207
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,745
- Cricks, I love you, but this is so boring.
- You're losing me.

208
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:33,546
Goddamn it! All right, you know what?
Screw you guys.

209
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,049
- Hey, Cricket? Cricket? Cricket!
- Come on.

210
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,551
Cricket, Cricket, calm down, man.
Hey, look.

211
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:39,520
What?

212
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,888
- You want the lemons or not?
- Unbelievable.

213
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:43,757
- Yes, I'm gonna take the lemons. Goddamn it.
- All right, yeah.

214
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,858
- You guys are the worst.
- He wants the lemons.

215
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:46,060
- He needs the lemons.
- The guy loves lemons.

216
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,493
He needs the lemons for the scurvy.

217
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:49,095
- Yeah, yeah.
- He'll be back.

218
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,867
After everything I've done, you know?

219
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,838
After everything they've done to me.

220
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,843
Belle?

221
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,943
What are you doing here?

222
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,745
Promise I'm not stalking you.

223
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:07,740
I'm just out for a walk.

224
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,987
My dad'll be so worried about me,

225
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:11,794
but I just had to get out of the house.

226
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:13,531
- Ah.
- Ever since my mom died,

227
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:17,558
I'm kind of all he's got,
so he's become a little overbearing.

228
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,193
Yeah, I get that.
I got an overbearing dad, too.

229
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,096
- Yeah.
- My life's the worst.

230
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,368
Um. Ah.

231
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,106
You're so funny.

232
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:34,240
Okay.

233
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,650
- And cute.
- Oh, son of a bitch.

234
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,551
Did someone put you up to this?

235
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,469
- No. Why?
- Look, I am not funny,

236
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,229
and I'm sure as shit not cute.

237
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:43,783
Nobody put me up to this, okay?

238
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:47,086
I like you. I do, and

239
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,623
I feel like we have more
in common than you think.

240
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,260
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

241
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,395
Go behind some Dumpster and bang?

242
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,631
I was kind of talking about that date.

243
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh. I'm into that.

244
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,647
There they are!

245
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,365
Davy, Pops.

246
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:56,786
I met the most amazing girl.

247
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,525
I'm in love. I'm in love!

248
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:00,017
And I owe it all to you, Dad,

249
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,252
for giving me a second chance.

250
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,086
Thank you. Now,

251
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,523
let's go in this meeting
and show this guy

252
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:07,090
that he is making the right choice

253
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:09,760
investing in the Mara brothers!

254
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,428
You missed it, asshole.

255
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:13,697
Huh?

256
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,331
You missed it. The meeting.
We lost the account.

257
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,795
Dad, I told you we couldn't trust him.

258
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,439
Goddamn it, Matt. This was your chance.

259
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:24,374
Shit. Okay. Um, I'll talk to the guy.

260
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:26,911
I will make this right, okay?

261
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,746
He's probably down by his car right now.

262
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,381
Carl Lewis couldn't catch him!

263
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,653
I can.

264
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,802
Mr. Sanderson!

265
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,236
Mr. Sanderson!

266
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:55,788
Matthew Mara.

267
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,641
Did you just do a flip off that truck?

268
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:58,976
Yes, sir. That is how dedicated I am

269
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:00,244
to keeping your business. Now, look,

270
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,646
I know you have your reservations,

271
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,979
but I'm asking you...
give us a second chance.

272
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,517
I'm not giving you a second chance.
I made my decision. It's final.

273
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:10,188
Okay. Well, guess I'm gonna
have to cut your heart out then.

274
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,023
What did you just say?

275
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:14,624
I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut...

276
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:17,360
your heart... out of your body.

277
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:18,763
You see, uh,

278
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,364
I'm from the streets.

279
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:22,499
And I'm about to poke you full of holes.

280
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,002
He'll do it!

281
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,637
What? Well, th-that's great!

282
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,640
What changed your mind, Tom?

283
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:31,842
Uh, your son here
made a compelling argument.

284
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,179
What? Oh. Well, see, he's my boy.

285
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,180
We will not let you down,

286
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,016
- Mr. Sanderson.
- Uh, D-Davy,

287
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:41,651
- don't push. Uh,
- Yes, sir.

288
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:44,355
Tom, let's discuss this.

289
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,657
Hey.

290
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,460
What?

291
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:51,362
Maybe I misjudged you.

292
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,630
Maybe you're not...

293
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:56,466
just some homeless junkie.

294
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,602
Maybe you're my brother.

295
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:04,542
Sorry I said that about Carl Lewis.

296
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,352
- Belle.
- Heard me comin', I guess.

297
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,723
I think I just saved the company.

298
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,389
Wow. That's great news for you.

299
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:21,926
And probably bad news for me.

300
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,362
I'm running away.

301
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,029
I got to see the world.

302
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,866
I was wondering if you might
want to come away with me.

303
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:31,601
I-I can't.

304
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:34,371
I mean, this is my life now.

305
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:36,940
Yeah. I understand.

306
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,042
Well, I should go.

307
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,946
Hey, um...

308
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,715
could you just help me with my necklace?

309
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:46,951
I can never seem to get it off.

310
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,653
Sure.

311
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:53,556
- Here.
- No, I... I want you to keep it.

312
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:55,893
Something to remember me by.

313
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,564
Well, good-bye, Matthew.

314
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,600
Well, here's something
to remember me by.

315
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,379
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
what are you doing?!

316
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,581
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making out

317
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:20,283
- with the woman I love.
- What the hell

318
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,219
are you talking about? That's Dad's dog.

319
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:25,589
You're making out with my dog!

320
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,258
Dog?

321
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,292
Oh, shit!

322
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,629
Oh, no.

323
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:36,100
Maybe it's time to make a change.

324
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,284
Nah, I'm gonna smoke it.

325
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:57,787
- I'm Cricket.
<i>- I'm Belle.</i>

326
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:59,623
- That's a nice name.
<i>- His shoes</i>

327
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,125
- <i>smell like rotten eggs.</i>
- Lemons.

328
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:03,860
- Screw you guys!
- <i>You smell his shoes?</i>

329
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:15,439
Huh.

330
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:16,506
He's gone.

331
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,675
Way to go, Rickety Cricket.

332
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,479
So, you did exactly
what I thought you'd do,

333
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:24,614
you goddamn street rat!

334
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,391
Matt, Matt, goddamn it.

335
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,954
I gave you a shot.

336
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:31,688
You can't go around

337
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,794
doing insane shit like kissing dogs.

338
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,963
You got to put all that nonsense
behind you once and for all.

339
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:41,898
Now, this is my last
and final offer.

340
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:45,335
You cut that bullshit out
and come work with me,

341
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,870
or you go back on the street

342
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:48,838
and crawl back into that manure pile

343
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,408
I found you in.

344
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,143
So, which is it?

345
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,377
Huh?

346
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:59,182
- Hey-o!
- Oh, Cricket!

347
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:01,685
- Cricket!
- Hey, hey!

348
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:04,021
Hey, you guys mind if I go in
the bathroom and smoke some PCP?

349
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,922
- Smoke up, bud.
- Yeah, absolutely, dude.

350
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,391
- Do what you got to do, man.
- You do you, bud. You do you!

351
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:08,893
We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.

352
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,927
- Have fun, buddy.
- Go, Cricket.

353
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:13,127
