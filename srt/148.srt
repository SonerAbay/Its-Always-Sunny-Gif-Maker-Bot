1
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:07,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Philadelphia Zoo.

2
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:09,200
- Just a reminder that...
- Damn it. Where is Frank?

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,549
I'm not missing this lion feeding.

4
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:12,333
Oh, lions are cool, man.

5
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:13,769
For sure.
But, you know, the best exhibit's

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,336
- the meerkats. You know?
- Meerkats!

7
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:17,643
Hey, man, you know,
they have those bubbles,

8
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,862
you know, where you can pop
your head up out of the ground

9
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,125
- and look around.
- Yeah, you're looking around.

10
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,343
It's like you are a meerkat.

11
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:23,997
No, I'm not waiting for Frank.
I'm-I'm just gonna go in.

12
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,477
- No.
- 'Cause I-I don't want to wait here for the guy.

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,479
I know. But I think we should...

14
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:29,350
I really feel like we
need to stick together.

15
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,135
- Huh?
- Dee, will you calm down? She got lost at the zoo

16
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:32,919
- when we were seven. It's fine.
- I-I got trampled

17
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:35,356
- by wild animals at the zoo when I was seven.
- Sheep.

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,531
- At the petting zoo.
- Goats!

19
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:38,272
- It was.
- You don't have to worry about that. Okay, guys?

20
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,535
Because modern technology
has figured this out for us.

21
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,711
We're all connected now.

22
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,583
That is why I started
this group text chain.

23
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:47,151
You know? So we can stay
in constant communication.

24
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:48,543
I'm just gonna hit up Frank real quick,

25
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:50,025
and we'll find out what's up.

26
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,547
Guys, this way,
nobody is gonna get lost,

27
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,984
because the texting keeps
us all on the same page.

28
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:56,899
- Okay.
- Oh. Well, see, there you go.

29
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:58,466
- Frank's five minutes away.
- Great. - No, no, no.

30
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,120
No, everybody knows that "five min away"

31
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,122
actually means 20 minutes away, okay?

32
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,384
I'm not missing this live feeding, okay?

33
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:05,256
Dude, why the big deal
about watching a-a lion

34
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,300
eat a pile of dead meat?

35
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:08,128
Oh, no, no, no. Wrong. Alive.

36
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:10,261
Okay? Quite alive, I assure you.

37
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,132
- That's a thing? Zoos do that?
- That's a thing.

38
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:14,395
- _
- What's this?

39
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,527
- Dennis has a boner? He does?
- Yes.

40
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,572
- No, he doesn't.
- Well, goddamn it, he did.

41
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:19,574
I did. It's gone now.

42
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:21,402
Uh, do we have to do
this whole texting thing?

43
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,752
- I mean, Dee's already annoying.
- She's always been annoying, Charlie.

44
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,406
That's why we ditched
her when she was seven.

45
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,626
- You... ditched me?
- Oh, shut up, Dee. Shut up!

46
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,323
God, don't make this all about you.

47
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,151
- I'm-I'm going in. I don't-I don't want to wait.
- Well, then I'm gonna

48
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:33,066
- go with you, 'cause I don't want to get ditched again.
- Fine. Whatever.

49
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,415
- Yeah, we'll catch up with you.
- Look, look, look.

50
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,025
And just text us when he gets here.

51
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,201
Who? Frank?

52
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,855
Yes, Frank.
Who else would we be talking about?

53
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,457
Oh, well, I just want to make sure

54
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,758
- we're all on the same page.
- Oh, my God.

55
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:44,599
Text us when Frank gets here!

56
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:46,297
Huh?!

57
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,168
- Frank. Text...
- Frank! What? Text us! Text us!

58
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:50,214
Text us when Frank gets here!

59
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:51,867
I can't... I can't... You know what?

60
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,304
- I can't... Let me just... I'm-a...
- Text 'em now.

61
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,436
I'm gonna text y... Check your phone!

62
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,787
I'm gonna text you!

63
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,484
_

64
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,598
- God, I'm so thirsty.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,034
Well, that's the cinnamon in the churro.

66
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,036
- That'll make you thirsty.
- You know what?

67
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,299
I'm gonna... I'm gonna update the group.

68
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:35,563
Why are you texting that?

69
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:39,350
Oh, well, I just wanted to, uh,
update the group on my status.

70
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,308
Yeah, but that's, like,
a sexual thing, man.

71
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,440
That means you're
thirsting for something,

72
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,919
which means you're horny for it.

73
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,227
Dennis is funny with the texts, man.

74
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:48,328
Huh.

75
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,622
Aw, come on. Too late, Dee.

76
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,624
Goddamn it. Where is Frank?

77
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,452
I'm just... You know what?
I'm just gonna text him again,

78
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:55,888
'cause I don't know what
the hell's going on.

79
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,455
Where you be?

80
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:00,936
Huh. What does that mean? He's...

81
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,591
- It's a dancing woman, a smiley face and a gun.
- Oh.

82
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,158
I know what that means.

83
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:08,161
He's stuck behind a woman driver
and he wants to shoot himself.

84
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,728
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,600
All right.
Well, I'm just gonna update everybody.

86
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,602
- "Late."
- Yeah, but come on, man.

87
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,865
You keep sending updates
with no new information.

88
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,172
No, no, I'm just keeping
the whole group updated

89
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,392
the way a meerkat might.

90
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,958
Yeah, but a meerkat's
efficient in how it updates.

91
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,308
You know what I mean?
Like, one little chirp,

92
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,745
it can warn a whole group of,
like, an eagle or whatever.

93
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,529
It doesn't need to, like, chirp over

94
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,183
and over and over again, you know?

95
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,533
I-I'm sorry, a-are you
schooling me on meerkat knowledge?

96
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,492
- Seems like I have to.
- Oh, oh, is that right?

97
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:35,841
Well, first of all, smarty-pants,

98
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,712
they don't chirp. They chirrup.

99
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,714
Oh, yeah? You think you know
a ton about the meerkat?

100
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,890
Well, did you know that the
alpha pair will scent-mark

101
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,675
the subordinate to show
that it's the leader?

102
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:46,199
If they find the weak one,
they start pissing all over it.

103
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,331
Yes. Of course I know that, Charlie.

104
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:48,897
We watched the same documentary.

105
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,117
By the way, I'm not the one
that passed out halfway through

106
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,336
and scent-marked all over himself.

107
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,207
- I drank a case of beer, man.
- So did I.

108
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,383
I also drank a case of beer,
and I didn't piss myself.

109
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,732
All I'm saying is you don't have
to text, like,

110
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,370
every three seconds, you know?

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,432
Aw, goddamn it.
Where is Frank? I just...

112
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,955
- You're gonna text it again?
- Yeah, I'm gonna...

113
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:04,696
- I just got to make sure everybody knows.
- It just means that you're...

114
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,006
you want... you're horny. Oh.

115
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,221
Ah, Dennis g... Dennis nailed it.

116
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,441
- What-what does that mean?
- A peach is a butt.

117
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,679
You're horny for a butt.

118
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,227
- I'm-I'm horny for a butt?
- 'Cause you're gay. - FRANK: Hey-o!

119
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,576
- Sorry I'm late. I had...
- Oh.

120
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,013
...had to get a bag of bananas
so I could taunt the gorilla.

121
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,015
It took you two hours to get bananas?

122
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,148
Yeah, well, I was stuck
behind that woman driver.

123
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,541
I thought I texted you that.

124
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,585
Yeah, we got that.

125
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:25,760
- Let's just go inside.
- I...

126
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:27,675
Aw, c... Too late, Dee. Come on.

127
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,329
- She sucks.
- Pick up the pace with it,

128
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:30,896
- you know?
- She sucks.

129
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,464
- I texted a peach.
- I already did that, Dee.

130
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,466
Oh, yeah. There it is.

131
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,163
You know, speed's very important
in comedy texting, Dee.

132
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:39,948
If it looks like you thought about it
for a while, it's pretty lame.

133
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:41,559
- Yeah. I know.
- Yeah.

134
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:44,562
Ooh, you know what I'll do?
I'll do a fist. Right?

135
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,703
So it's like he's thirsty
for a fist in the butt.

136
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,131
I don't think anybody's gonna get that.

137
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,438
You know? Plus, the moment
is long gone. I mean...

138
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:53,440
Goddamn it. What...

139
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,355
No, that... I was wrong.
That was funny. I...

140
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,617
Oh, Dee.

141
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,750
Well, you guys
are too fast on this thing.

142
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
_

143
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,448
- Don't answer. I got this.
- Let me just...

144
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,276
- I can... No, no! No.
- But you're... Okay, go, go.

145
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,886
I got it, I got it. Okay.

146
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:10,370
What's a... funny thing I can...

147
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:12,198
Oh, my God. Stop. I...

148
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:14,808
- _
- _

149
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:16,376
- Go.
- Well, I mean...

150
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,508
- Look at that.
- Yeah, but...

151
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,031
- Quick. Concise. Job done.
- Whatever.

152
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:20,511
- Okay.
- No confusion.

153
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,646
- All right. Sea lions, here we are.
- Okay.

154
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,518
- All right. Where are they?
- Yeah.

155
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,588
I don't know.

156
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,624
- _
- _

157
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,527
- Mm?
- Wait a minute.

158
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,398
- He said in front. He's not in front.
- Eh.

159
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,400
- Exhibit ent...
- Entrance?

160
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:42,576
Oh, come on.
I got to go rescue these guys

161
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,317
at the exhibit entrance? Excuse me, sir?

162
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:45,884
Sir? Yeah.

163
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,234
Um, h-how long do we have
till the lion begins feeding?

164
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:49,670
Uh, we're five minutes out.

165
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,672
Five minutes out? Okay.
Thank you, thank you. All right.

166
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,282
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
I don't want to get lost.

167
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:54,980
No, I will not adjust
my gait to accommodate

168
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,895
your weird insecurities about sheep.

169
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:58,679
It was a goat, and it was a lunatic.

170
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,073
- Its eyes were going in every direction.
- Oh, were they? Fascinating.

171
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:02,422
- Tell me more!
- He pounced on me,

172
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,642
and then all of his friends
moved in for the kill.

173
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:06,426
- Ooh! Terrifying. Ooh!
- Don't do that.

174
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,527
It was so scary!

175
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:12,258
_

176
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:13,694
- Oh.
- What does that mean?

177
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:16,001
Shit, he's-he's having fun without us.

178
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,569
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Mac, that's sarcastic.

179
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,485
If he was having fun,
it would have an exclamation point.

180
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:23,574
I'm gonna de-escalate.
I'm gonna de-escalate.

181
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,619
- Probably pissed he can't find us.
- Wait.

182
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,920
_

183
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,145
- Oh, shit.
- What does that mean?

184
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,712
- Oh...
- That's not g... What it means is

185
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,105
that he's already given the information

186
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,585
and he doesn't want to
have to repeat himself.

187
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,325
- So you got to scroll up and see.
- So, what... Scroll up.

188
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:37,457
- Scroll up.
- Dennis hates to repeat himself.

189
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,024
Well, let's find what he's...

190
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,895
Ah.

191
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,507
"Went to C lions."

192
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,726
Oh. Shit.

193
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,946
Dude, do you think
he went to the sea lions

194
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:49,600
or he went to go see the lion?

195
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,689
- Ooh...
- Oh. I don't know.

196
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:53,212
I don't know. Let me ask.

197
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,160
_

198
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,477
Oh. Yeah, yeah, I...

199
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:59,087
What'd you get wrong there?

200
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,176
_

201
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,613
_

202
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,616
- Sea. Um...
- Dude, just let me, all right?

203
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,834
- Well, it's-it's the predictive te...
- It's better...

204
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,662
it's better with pictures.

205
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,666
- Went to sea lion or...
- Lions.

206
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,974
...see a lion?

207
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,410
Right.

208
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:18,802
_

209
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,500
- Oh. He's mad.
- Oh, no, but... -Yeah.

210
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,284
- No.
- No, it's got an exclamation point.

211
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:23,851
- That means it's happy.
- No, it's all... - He's-he's screaming at you.

212
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:25,505
- Yeah, it's all caps.
- It's all caps. -Screaming?

213
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,420
- Yeah. That's not good.
- That's...

214
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:29,248
- _
- What is this?

215
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:32,077
- What-what is...
- What does that mean?

216
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,209
What does that mean?
I don't know. Dee-Dee sucks, man.

217
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,515
- I don't know.
- She-she sucks.

218
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,599
All right, watch this.

219
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:38,649
How about that with the eggplant?

220
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,998
- Oh. Ooh. We're coming.
- All right, let's go.

221
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,695
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah.

222
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,089
Oh, yeah. "We're coming."

223
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,525
Charlie made it work.

224
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,657
- Oh.
- Nice. Nice.

225
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,093
Idiots went to the wrong exhibit.

226
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,442
All right, let-let-let's get back there.

227
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:50,574
I don't want to miss anything. Come on.

228
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,532
Okay. All right.
Well, stop walking like...

229
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,230
Hey, pal. How's it going?

230
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,754
Uh... where's the lion?

231
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:58,103
- Are we close? Are we close?
- Oh.

232
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,757
Yeah, you just missed it.
Yeah, he's fed.

233
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,541
- He's back in his cage.
- Oh.

234
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,804
He ate the kill?
He-he devoured the kill?

235
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,806
- And I wasn't here?
- No, the feeding. Yeah, yeah.

236
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,808
- You just missed it. It was awesome.
- No.

237
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,897
Man, you said we were five minutes out.

238
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:11,899
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, but that was only ten minutes ago.

239
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:13,466
C-Correct.

240
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,685
No, but nobody does it that way.

241
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,470
The five minutes means
20 minutes, man. You can't...

242
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:18,993
- It's the whole reason I'm here!
- Uh...

243
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,604
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

244
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,736
Hey, man. You missed it. It was awesome.

245
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,957
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Oh.

246
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:32,572
- _
- Uh...

247
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,705
Oh, oh. He's thanking us
for something, so that's good.

248
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,402
Dude, how are you so bad at this, man?

249
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,404
He probably missed the feeding.
He's blaming us.

250
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:39,623
- Yeah.
- What?

251
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,841
Shit. You think?

252
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:42,626
- Yeah.
- Probably.

253
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,149
No. Hold on.

254
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,717
I'm just gonna send him
something real quick

255
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,066
- _
- and make sure everything's all good.

256
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,415
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah.

257
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,590
He says he's great, so we're fine.

258
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:52,418
Dude.

259
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,507
- He's screaming at you, man.
- Yeah.

260
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:55,813
Screaming?

261
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:57,292
Dude,
this whole texting thing is your idea,

262
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,859
and you don't know how texting works?

263
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,078
No, he's...
He just did it in all capitals.

264
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,645
- That's screaming.
- That's a scream.

265
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,864
- That's what you do when you're screaming.
- That's not scream...

266
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,649
This is just all one
big misunderstanding

267
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,086
due to the sea lions, all right?
I know what to do.

268
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,783
I'm just gonna speak from the heart.

269
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:11,959
Let me just text
s-something from the heart

270
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,701
that he's gonna understand,
something a little bit...

271
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,442
- All right.
- Mmm.

272
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:17,835
Smell good.

273
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:20,533
Not really normal to the... if I...

274
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:22,970
- Come on.
- Is there a...?

275
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:25,494
What rhymes with "limber"?
What rhymes with it?

276
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,541
- Hinder.
- How do you not get "timber"?

277
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:30,543
- Timber.
- Timber. And...

278
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:32,023
- Oh. Salutations.
- And send.

279
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,328
- Okay.
- Ah, dude.

280
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,852
So, let's just give him a chance.

281
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:36,201
He's probably gonna take
some time and respond to...

282
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:37,550
- Oh!
- No, he responded.

283
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,030
- Yeah.
- Uh, "K."

284
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:42,076
- You're dead to him.
- Yeah, he's blowing you off, man.

285
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,730
- "K" means "okay."
- He is pissed, dude. - "K."

286
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:44,905
- Yeah.
- He is... - "K" means "okay."

287
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,907
- No.
- He didn't even bother to read your thing!

288
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,430
- He just sent "K."
- How could he possibly read that whole...?

289
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,128
- He read it!
- He is pissed off at you.

290
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,999
- Dennis is the fastest reader in America.
- Can we just...?

291
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,261
Oh, now he's calling me.

292
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:54,567
- He's calling?
- Oh, good. Good, good, yeah.

293
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:56,047
You could just text, but no.
Call me, call me!

294
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,571
- I want to hear from you.
- Okay. You're gonna like this.

295
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,746
_

296
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,097
- Uh, what is that?
- I called him the "F" word.

297
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,568
It's a bundle of sticks.

298
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,798
No. Dee, no. You can't do that.
That's not funny.

299
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,912
Okay, y-you can't say that word.

300
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,148
I didn't say the word.
I did the pictures.

301
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:11,715
But it doesn't matter.
That's offensive, okay?

302
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:14,065
And it's off-putting,
and it's not a good color on you.

303
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,806
Blue? You're gonna go blue?
Don't go blue.

304
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,634
That tells me that you're
just not funny at all.

305
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:18,721
_

306
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:20,593
- Yeah.
- What?

307
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,943
Frank nailing it again.

308
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,468
What's so funny about what you did?

309
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,470
Well, it works on two levels, Dee.

310
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:29,950
It-it says that, uh, Frank's on fire

311
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,952
and also that, uh,
Mac is a raging flamer,

312
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:33,954
which is still totally acceptable,
for now.

313
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,130
I have an idea. I have an idea.
Check this out.

314
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:39,830
What is that?

315
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,180
I'm joking that maybe we
should get the Jew lawyer

316
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:44,922
and have an arbitration about
what words we can and can't use

317
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:46,967
to describe Mac's sexuality.

318
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:51,624
Cool! Super funny

319
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,539
and not the least bit anti-Semitic.

320
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:55,933
You get it! You get it.

321
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:57,108
Should we just get out of here?

322
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,631
- Let's do that.
- Yeah. Well, hold on.

323
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:00,764
Well, okay, but hang on.

324
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,635
Wait, Dennis. Hey, excuse me.

325
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,202
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Dennis, wait, wait,

326
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,857
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay. Where'd you go?

327
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,859
Where'd you go? Oh, no.

328
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,991
Oh, no.

329
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:12,601
Dennis!

330
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:17,084
Why won't Dennis answer my calls?

331
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:19,391
Dude, who cares?
Man, I'm so sick of this texting shit.

332
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:22,002
- Come on.
- It's like we're not even enjoying the zoo, man.

333
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,569
- No see no animals.
- "Missed your calls."

334
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,005
- That's what it is.
- Jesus Christ.

335
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,106
- Oh, dude, he...
- He missed them.

336
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,747
- He's lying to you.
- He's avoiding you.

337
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,227
Look, can we just go see the meerkats?

338
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,445
Please? Let's just drop it.

339
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,795
We'll go to the meerkats.
We'll have fun.

340
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:33,971
I want to go taunt the gorillas
before they get fed

341
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:35,320
and they're not hungry anymore.

342
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,365
Why do you even want
to taunt a gorilla? What is that?

343
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:38,453
Oh, it's hysterical.

344
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,629
I sit there, eat a banana real slow,

345
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:41,979
and he comes up to the glass,

346
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:44,938
and he's banging on the glass
like the dumb ape he is.

347
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:48,376
It will bang its hands bloody
trying to get the banana.

348
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,682
How is that funny?

349
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,685
It's funny
'cause he can't get the banana.

350
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:53,991
All right, dude. You know what?

351
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,470
Go ahead.
Go taunt the gorillas, all right?

352
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,472
But I'm going to the meerkats.
I'm not going with you.

353
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,387
Suit yourself.

354
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,812
All right, can we just go
to the meer...? What are you doing now?

355
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:02,856
- What is this?
- I'm just sending one last text.

356
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,349
You're gonna send another gi...
Another gi...

357
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:06,655
- Okay, it's gonna take a little bit of... Oh!
- Oh.

358
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,005
Oh, he read that so fast.

359
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,397
- He didn't read it at all!
- I think...

360
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,051
Dude, he doesn't want to talk to you!

361
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,836
Can we just please
go to the meerkats, dude?

362
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,937
No. You know what I'm gonna do?

363
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,143
I'm just gonna hang out
in the bathroom for a while.

364
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,493
You're gonna hang out in the bathroom?

365
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,844
- Yeah, for a while.
- Why?

366
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,715
It's a gay thing,
so you really wouldn't understand.

367
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,151
- What?
- Yeah, you know, it's, like,

368
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,284
bathrooms at zoos are, like,

369
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,808
big Grindr spots for closeted dads.

370
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,679
Dude, I know what's up here.
You're ditching me, man.

371
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,029
You're-you're ditching me

372
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,944
so you can go beg forgiveness
from Dennis, dude.

373
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,859
- It's so pathetic, man.
- No, I am not, Charlie.

374
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,643
- It's so pathetic, dude. Dude, you're no meerkat.
- I am not!

375
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:39,514
- I'm not doing th... I am a... Don't...
- I'll tell you...

376
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,864
You're not a meerkat.

377
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,169
- Don't be...
- Meerkats stick together, Mac!

378
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,431
Don't be like that, Charlie.

379
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:45,172
Of course I'm a meerkat, all right?

380
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,957
Bullshit! Then why
aren't you hanging with me?!

381
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,089
I just want to go meet
my needs real quick...

382
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,743
What about the needs of the group, Mac?

383
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,745
I'm gonna meet the needs
of the group, Charlie, after that,

384
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:53,964
but I just feel like... Are you...

385
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,269
are you pissing on me?!

386
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:56,967
- Yeah.
- Oh, uh...

387
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,272
Direct eye contact?

388
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,373
Yeah!

389
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:05,105
- Your neck's very high.
- Yeah.

390
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,759
- Okay, I'm done.
- Oh.

391
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,937
Don't look at me.

392
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,119
_

393
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,088
_

394
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,166
_

395
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,598
_

396
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,494
_

397
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,015
Goddamn it!

398
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:50,408
_

399
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:57,961
_

400
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,163
Dennis.

401
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,817
Y-You came to talk to me.

402
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,732
Unless this is, like,
a Grindr situation?

403
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:07,864
I came to piss.

404
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,823
Look, man, I know that you're mad at me,

405
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,477
but when you said
that thing about "C lions,"

406
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,958
- Charlie was like...
- Oh, that's a lie.

407
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,177
That's just a lie,
because Charlie can't read.

408
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:19,919
All right, it was all my fault,
but it was an honest mistake.

409
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,181
One thing, Mac.

410
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,923
I mean, I came here
to see one goddamn thing,

411
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,969
and you ruined it with
your texting nonsense.

412
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,971
Yes, but I have some new information.

413
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,625
There's going to be
another live feeding.

414
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,065
- Go on.
- Yeah.

415
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,154
A goat is to be sacrificed.

416
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:39,721
I heard an employee in here.
He was talking about it.

417
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:43,203
- Now, I offered to blow him, but he was like, "Nah, I'm..."
- Goat?

418
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:48,034
That's some Jurassic Park shit.
I like it.

419
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,777
But if you're gonna join me,

420
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,866
you must follow my every command
because, I swear to God,

421
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,868
if you make me miss this one, too,

422
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:59,350
I will feed you to the lions myself.

423
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,134
Okay.

424
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,137
Are you pissing on me?

425
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:06,313
Yeah.

426
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,578
You guys grinding?

427
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:11,984
- Ah.
- _

428
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,975
Hey! Where you a...

429
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,804
Where you at, you big, dumb baboon?

430
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,807
Huh?

431
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,026
Uh, excuse me.

432
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,116
Excuse me. Where's the, uh...

433
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,988
- Where's the big animal? The... Uh.
- _

434
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,338
Ah. Annoying bird.

435
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,818
- The what?
- Nah.

436
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,038
No, it's just the phones are...
they're so distracting.

437
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:38,128
Now, where's the big, dumb,
you know, the ape, the animal?

438
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,259
The-the-the silverback?

439
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:40,782
Yeah, the dummy. Yeah.

440
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:42,132
Yeah. Uh, well, that's Andy. Uh, Andy...

441
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,047
- Andy the dummy.
- Yeah.

442
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,918
- He can be pretty shy.
- Yeah... He can be... Yeah.

443
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:47,050
So, yeah. So, sometimes you have to

444
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,703
- look to find him 'cause...
- Ah... Oh, excuse me.

445
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,924
- _
- What does this bitch...

446
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:54,057
What is she talking about?

447
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,276
I...

448
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,062
Hey! Hey!

449
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:00,150
Hey!

450
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,369
You big, dumb... Where's my bananas?!

451
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:04,719
Son of a...

452
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,156
You bastard!

453
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,505
Give me those bananas!

454
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,301
Come on.

455
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,685

456
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:29,802

Learn to read, idiot.

462
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,554
Goddamn it!

463
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:58,251
Okay.

464
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:00,775
So, this should be getting
started any minute.

465
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,995
I'm gonna drop a quick pin
because I think the guys

466
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,344
- are gonna want to see this.
- Yeah.

467
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:06,259
You know, I got to say,
something feels a little off

468
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,914
to me a-about all this.
W-Why are we in the exhibit?

469
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:10,220
That doesn't feel safe, you know.

470
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,310
And why are a bunch of children
in the exhibit as well?

471
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,964
Yes, that does seem
a little strange, doesn't it?

472
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:18,271
Hi-hi. Uh, sir? Excuse me.

473
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:20,360
Uh, yeah.

474
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:22,275
When is the goat to be slaughtered?

475
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,234
Excuse me?

476
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,150
When is the goat
going to be fed to the lion?

477
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:30,022
Uh, my friend engaged in
a sexual exchange for information

478
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,372
and was told there was
going to be a sacrifice.

479
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,766
Well, he tried but I said no.

480
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:36,159
- Oh, that's...
- It's not what you think.

481
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,770
I think there's been
some miscommunication.

482
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,380
This is the-the petting zoo.

483
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,514
We're feeding the goats.
We're not slaughtering them.

484
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:50,260
Uh...

485
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,088
- Dennis, I, uh...
- It's fine.

486
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,266
No, it's fine, Mac.

487
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,833
This is all fine.

488
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,836
- Why don't we just go to the next exhibit.
- Oh.

489
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,317
Cool. Yeah, I thought you were
actually gonna be upset with me.

490
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,191
Dennis?

491
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,412
Dennis?!

492
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,763
Dennis? Dennis!

493
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,112
_

494
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:25,643
- Here you go, ma'am. Have fun.
- Huh? What?

495
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,080
- No. What's this?
- Okay, kids.

496
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:29,416
Let's go!

497
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:31,431
What?

498
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,455
No, get away from me.

499
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,417
No. God, please help me!

500
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:08,938
_

501
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,746
_

502
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:14,947
_

503
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,317
_

504
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,855
_

505
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,891
_

506
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,507
- Oh!
- Meerkats! Meerkats!

507
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,291
- That was amazing!
- I knew what you were saying

508
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:33,901
- by the looks on your faces.
- Yeah. -Yeah.

509
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,164
Hey, guys. I-I felt connected
to you for the first time today.

510
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,210
Yeah, see, that's what it's all about.

511
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:39,864
- You know what I mean?
- Dude, Charlie,

512
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,301
that smile said a thousand words,
you know?

513
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:43,650
It was like, "I told you so,"

514
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,218
but also, "I forgive you."
I understood everything.

515
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:48,089
- Yeah, I forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I could tell, Mac,

516
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,309
by the look on your face,
that you really were sorry

517
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:51,789
- about me having to miss that lion feeding.
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,356
And I-I really appreciated that, bro.

519
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,574
See, that's the thing, you know?

520
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,228
Like, even though
we were texting all day

521
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,577
and we were in constant communication,

522
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:59,927
I don't really think we
were communicating at all.

523
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,668
- That's a real form of communi...
- Yeah, I am getting one, though.

524
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:03,366
- Yeah, me, too.
- I do want to... Bowling ball,

525
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,498
water, eggplant, queen...

526
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,544
Oh, Frank is pissing on Mac. Very good.

527
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:08,601
- Yeah.
- Yes, I am.

528
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:09,720
- Yeah, yeah.
- Come on.

529
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,243
- Oh, he is!
- He is for real.

530
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,723
- Nice one.
- That's a great text, Dee. - Thank you.

531
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:14,464
- Oh, ah... You want a great text? I'm gonna...
- _

532
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,335
- No, no, Dee... Dee beat you to it.
- Yeah.

533
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,026
Huh? What do you think?

534
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:19,469
Well, then,
I'm gonna do one from the heart.

535
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,253
- I'm gonna do one from the heart.
- You liked it for real?

536
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:22,472
Oh, Mac, I like that. What is that?

537
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,735
I mean, they are... they're just funny.
