1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:03,060
Okay, so, just to clarify

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,970
for the parole board once
again, you are claiming that

3
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:10,580
your father threatened to, quote,
"eat the living shit out of you".

4
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:16,040
That is correct.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,830
And Mr. Kelly, in your sworn
statement to police, you claim

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,356
that the prisoner told you that
if you didn't, and I quote,

7
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:27,484
"jam a bunch of stuff into
your butt," he was going to

8
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:30,070
"rape you so hard
the room would stink."

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,300
Then, he was going to, quote,

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,833
"eat your butt and his son's butt

11
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:42,348
in the stink until his
stomach was full of...

12
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:45,965
your butts."

13
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,910
- Is this correct?
- That is also correct.

14
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:50,840
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,363
Warden, they're lying.

16
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,360
I do not want to hurt them.

17
00:00:54,855 --> 00:01:00,521
In fact, I want to get as far away
from those two as I possibly can.

18
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:01,549
Objection!

19
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:02,819
That's an objection, Your Honor.

20
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:03,610
Hey, he's lying to you!

21
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,876
Move to strike!

22
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:05,944
Move to strike!

23
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:08,173
Quiet! Sit down. Sit down!

24
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,361
He's lying!
He is lying!

25
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,957
Sit down... Get your hands
off the microphone.

26
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,463
Just leave it in the middle
of the two of you.

27
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,157
Leave it alone.

28
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:14,680
He said the middle, put it in
the middle.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,924
Take your hands off the mic!

30
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:17,380
- Leave it alone.
- That's not the middle.

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,014
Leave it there.

32
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:21,164
Yes.

33
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:26,169
A few weeks ago, they came to
apologize for getting me arrested.

34
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,992
I did not accept their apology.

35
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:29,858
That never happened!

36
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:30,566
We were friends...

37
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,675
Shut up! Charlie, shut up!

38
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:32,586
Quiet! Quiet!

39
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:33,478
Quiet at the hearing!

40
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:35,956
<i>Oh, yeah, Dad?</i>

41
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,660
<i>Not going to accept our apology?</i>

42
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:38,535
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

43
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:39,724
<i>Plan B, bitch!</i>

44
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,023
<i>We're going to bury you.</i>

45
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,190
<i>Yeah, Mr. Mac, I'm going to
tell those parole board dickheads</i>

46
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,240
<i>that you said you were going to rape
my butt until the room stinks,</i>

47
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:50,743
<i>and then you're going to eat my butt
until your stomach is full of butt.</i>

48
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:53,345
<i>Full of my butt,
and full of Mac's butt.</i>

49
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:55,780
<i>You're not going to say it
exactly like that...</i>

50
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,001
<i>I'm going to say
something like that, yeah.</i>

51
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:57,835
<i>Sure? That's a lot of butts.</i>

52
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,127
<i>Yeah, I think all the butt
madness is really going to sell it.</i>

53
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:07,756
<u><i>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia
4x04-05 : "Mac and Charlie Die"</u></i>

54
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:11,661
Synchro and
corrections : Sososeries

55
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:38,809
Charlie, I'm telling you,
running away is not the answer.

56
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,718
Mac, we're going to need
supplies on the road, okay.

57
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:43,456
So just calm down, help me throw
some stuff into the stinking bindle.

58
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,759
Dude, no matter where we go,
my dad will find us,

59
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,196
and while I admit it would be
awesome to be hobos,

60
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:50,010
drifting from town to town,
solving mysteries,

61
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,872
I think we need to find
a real solution.

62
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,833
Oh, my God, how do hobos fit
all this stuff into a bandana?!

63
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,364
It doesn't make sense, man.

64
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:58,880
We're going to need, like, a towel or
a tablecloth or something, but...

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,003
It's not going to look cool.

66
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,386
We're going to look like assholes...

67
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,462
Wait a second. That's it! I got it!

68
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:02,898
I got it!

69
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:04,099
Forget the bindle.

70
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,222
The only way that
my dad is not going to kill us,

71
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,167
is if he thinks we're already dead.

72
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:09,582
Oh, great.

73
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,521
I was hoping you'd say that.

74
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:11,284
Great, let's kill ourselves.

75
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,388
Let's do it.

76
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,551
No. No, you didn't let
me finish. I don't...

77
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,293
It's no problem, dude.

78
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:14,950
I'm totally on board.

79
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,443
Okay, I'm going to grab a knife,
I'm going to jab it into your neck,

80
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,888
I'll yank it out. Then your blood's
going to start going everywhere.

81
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:20,357
No, buddy, listen.

82
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:21,696
And you'll die in five
to ten minutes,

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,830
and then depending on
how horrific that looks,

84
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:23,927
I'll probably do it myself, too.

85
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:26,530
Okay, listen, I was going to
say we fake our own death,

86
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,112
and then he thinks we're dead,
and he leaves us alone.

87
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,734
Yeah, right.
Either way works, dude.

88
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,188
Let's just pick one
before he gets here.

89
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,792
Let's pick the second one
where we don't actually die.

90
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,597
Calm down!
We'll pick the second one.

91
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:38,017
All right now, let's think.

92
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,808
We got to do it in some way
that's convincing, all right.

93
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,605
If we were going to kill ourselves,
it'd be awesome, right ?

94
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:45,034
Yeah, yeah. If we were
going to kill ourselves,

95
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:46,628
it would be with class, right,
I mean, because we're worth it.

96
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:47,932
Of course it would be with class!

97
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,720
What do you think, I'm not
going to die with class?

98
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,522
Maybe some type of explosion?

99
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:52,955
Of course there's going
to be an explosion.

100
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,292
You think I'm not going to explode?

101
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,913
I'm thinking, Charlie, it would be some
kind of blaze of glory for you, yes...

102
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,782
Of course it's going to be a
blaze of glory.

103
00:03:58,878 --> 00:03:59,678
I'm going down right now.

104
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,737
No, no, no, okay, hold on
a second, okay, all right, so...

105
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:04,114
Did I miss something?

106
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,695
You're not getting this. I'll walk
you through the steps as we go.

107
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,181
First step: do not douse
yourself with lighter fluid.

108
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:14,934
- What is that?
- I don't know.

109
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you think it's for
watching somebody poop?

110
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:19,582
You think there's some perv
coming in here to watch me make?

111
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:20,736
What the hell are you
guys doing in here?

112
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:21,453
I got to go to the bathroom.

113
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:23,606
There's a hole in the wall. We're
just trying to figure out what it is.

114
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:28,556
Well, well, well, Deandra.

115
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:29,989
Would you look at that.

116
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,735
Frank, Dee, what you two have
discovered today

117
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:39,069
is what is most commonly
referred to... as a glory hole.

118
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:40,980
A glory hole?

119
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,616
A secret portal created
as a passage way

120
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:45,242
for one to safely
insert one's penis.

121
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,675
I'm sorry, a hole
to stick your dick in?

122
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,487
The partition acts
as a physical barrier,

123
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:53,896
thus ensuring anonymity throughout
the spontaneous act of copulation,

124
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,109
or fellatio, or at
the very least, a hand job.

125
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,189
What? Why?

126
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,209
Why would you want to have sex
with someone you can't see?

127
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:03,716
Well, Dee, I think
the real question is,

128
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,015
why wouldn't you want to have
sex with someone you can't see?

129
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:08,305
It's very European.

130
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:11,154
Europe leads the way in sexual
exploration, and quite frankly,

131
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,011
I think it's time we caught up.

132
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,913
This sounds hot.

133
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,486
I'm going to go get some duct tape.

134
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,235
Now, hold on
a second there, Frank.

135
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,945
Before you go sticking anything
through that hole,

136
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,372
you might want to consider that
on the other side of this wall,

137
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:25,737
more often than not,
there's a dude.

138
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,124
But you can't see through the wall,
so how do you know it's not a girl?

139
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:33,881
I mean, I could just picture
a girl, and then, it's good.

140
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,632
Right, well, some might find
that method effective,

141
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:40,286
but it's a dangerous game
you're playing, Frank.

142
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:43,770
Supposing the other guy is
picturing a girl, also.

143
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,569
How's he going to do that
with a dick in his mouth?

144
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:49,428
I don't know. That's his problem.

145
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,106
We're filling it in.

146
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:53,695
Okay, buddy, you ready?

147
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,975
Are you sure we have to do this?

148
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:57,479
Charlie, yes, we have to do this.

149
00:05:57,718 --> 00:05:59,397
Look, if the cops are going to
identify the bodies,

150
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:00,994
we need to leave dental
records behind, right?

151
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:02,528
So we leave a couple of teeth,
bing, bam, boom.

152
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,795
I know. I feel like
it's going to hurt.

153
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,947
Yeah, it's going to hurt
like a bitch. Okay, ready?

154
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,812
One, two...

155
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,579
Wait. That just kind of
came out on its own.

156
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,964
Yeah, that slipped right out, huh?

157
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,149
I barely pulled that.
I barely pulled it.

158
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,872
What? Damn, dude!

159
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:18,611
That's another...

160
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:21,467
Man, you should really brush your
teeth more because that is not normal.

161
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:24,134
Oh, Charlie, stop pulling
your teeth out like that, man.

162
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,934
It's freaking me out.

163
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,517
They're just coming right out.
They, like, slip right out.

164
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:27,621
It's really freaking me out!

165
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,923
Oh, shit.

166
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,697
- You think it's my dad?
- Of course it's your dad.

167
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:32,685
Charlie, open up.

168
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,141
We got a dick hole in the bar.

169
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,489
I need you to come fill it in.

170
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,420
Okay, I got to go fill her
a dick hole, bro.

171
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:38,864
No, no, no, bro, come on.
We don't have time.

172
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,115
Okay, uh, audible.
Grab the camera.

173
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,294
Is Dee's car outside?

174
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:43,516
Uh... yes.

175
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,072
Okay, great. We'll steal it. We'll
use it as a part of blaze of glory.

176
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:48,042
Charlie, now you got to stop.

177
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:48,899
You really got to stop.
Just give it to me.

178
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:50,998
Give me all the teeth.
Okay, I got them in my pocket.

179
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,200
Huh? Hey! What the...

180
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,351
Okay, go, go, go!

181
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,541
Why would you do that?

182
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,396
Come on! Open the door!

183
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,923
Huh? I don't know.
It's all happening so fast, man!

184
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,050
You could've just opened it.

185
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:06,980
Oh, that's true.

186
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,315
I'll fire you through that window.
All right, grab the...

187
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,890
Just go! Just go! Go, go, go!

188
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,752
The videotape is done.

189
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,009
My teeth are scattered
throughout the car,

190
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:27,365
and the will is in place.

191
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,504
Great.
Toss it out the window.

192
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,009
They'll think we did it
at the last minute.

193
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:32,218
Okay, got it.

194
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,442
Okay. What's next?

195
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,283
All right, I'm going to gun
this car as fast as it goes

196
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,901
directly into that wall.

197
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:40,005
Now, judging by the distance,
I'm thinking I could get it up

198
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,842
to about 60, 70 miles an hour.

199
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:42,725
Oh, definitely, definitely.

200
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,060
At the last possible second,

201
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,601
I'm thinking maybe
three feet from the wall...

202
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:49,736
We jump out to safety, the car
explodes in a hot ball of fury

203
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,346
and we're dead to the world.

204
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:52,190
Okey dokey.

205
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,370
Good luck with that.

206
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:54,645
Wait. Where you going, dude?

207
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:57,596
Well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
watch you do it.

208
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,287
No, we need to do it together.

209
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,217
- But I'm not really doing anything.
- Yes, you are, Charlie.

210
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,097
You're here for moral support.

211
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,032
But if no one's actually
seeing us jump out of the car...

212
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:05,683
Well, it's... we're gonna
kill ourselves together.

213
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:06,329
There's no real...

214
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,611
Get out, get out, get out.

215
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,444
I'll do it myself.

216
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:10,295
The whole thing's gonna be
better without me anyway, Mac.

217
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm telling you, it's gonna be
great without me.

218
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:12,779
All right, buddy, good luck!

219
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:14,733
Pussy.

220
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,841
Holy shit, dude, are you all
right?

221
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:30,067
Why didn't you jump out?

222
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,573
- I'm okay, I'm okay, Charlie.
- Holly shit!

223
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,258
Dude, oh, my God!

224
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:34,428
I guess I was just going too fast.

225
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:35,588
I was going too fast.

226
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:36,568
Oh, my God.

227
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,912
All right, let's get out of here.

228
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:38,927
We're gonna have to burn the car.

229
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,350
Let's do it.

230
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:40,571
We'll have to get some gasoline.

231
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,851
Holy shit!

232
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,286
We're not gonna find something
to burn the car at a pawnshop.

233
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:51,992
Are you kidding me?

234
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,607
You can find amazing things
in pawnshops.

235
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:54,563
This is the perfect...

236
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,820
Should've gone to a gas
station, dude,

237
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,323
and buy some gasoline
to burn the car.

238
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,381
I know, but we've been talking
about this the whole walk over.

239
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:00,810
You can't go to a gas station.

240
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:01,957
There's too many cameras.

241
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,669
Bro, like, I say something,
and then you, like,

242
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,094
forget it two seconds later, okay?

243
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,123
Are you sure you're all right?

244
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:07,957
Your ear's bleeding a ton.

245
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,474
I'm fine.

246
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:10,106
I feel like $1 million.

247
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:11,373
All right, well,
you don't seem like...

248
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,221
Well, then, focus,
Mr. Million Dollars,

249
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,053
and let's find something
to blow up a car.

250
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,828
Oh, Charlie!

251
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:18,720
Look at that wedding dress, dude.

252
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,406
That's sad.

253
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,902
Okay, that is not gonna blow
a car up, okay?

254
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,143
So, can you focus?

255
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:27,578
Will you please find a way to
focus?

256
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,549
Oh, shit, look at this, dude!

257
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:32,158
Now we're talking.

258
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,711
Damn, they sell guns here?

259
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:34,997
They sell everything here.

260
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,346
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

261
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,230
Pawnshops are like
international waters.

262
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:41,212
People come in, and they just
trade stuff, you know what I mean ?

263
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:42,250
Anything goes here.

264
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:43,914
We can get whatever
we want, all right?

265
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:44,622
Let's pick this bad boy up.

266
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:45,925
Shit, that's awesome.
All right, good.

267
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,338
So you're sure we'll have enough money
for this and the wedding dress, right ?

268
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,592
'Cause that is a great gun.

269
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,328
We're not buying
the wedding dress.

270
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:55,512
Yeah, we're buying
the wedding dress.

271
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,202
Are you crazy?

272
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,226
We can't just leave it here.

273
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,214
We absolutely can leave it here.

274
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,444
It's not gonna help us
in any way, shape or form.

275
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,141
That's crazy.

276
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:01,534
Bro, okay, you know what?

277
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:03,634
That car wreck, it scrambled
your circuits, all right?

278
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:04,293
You're losing your mind.

279
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,896
So, will you just
let me handle it?

280
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:07,126
I got Dee's purse.

281
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,156
We got her credit cards in here.

282
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,096
We have plenty of money.

283
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,045
I know what I'm doing.

284
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:11,701
And stop talking about
the wedding dress.

285
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:12,276
All right.

286
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:14,711
Sir, excuse me, sir.

287
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,406
Hi, we are in desperate need
of something that will destroy

288
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:24,117
a car and, uh, annihilate any
traces of a human being.

289
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,027
Let me see what I got.

290
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:28,875
All right, you see that?

291
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,910
Your old buddy here knows
what he's doing every now and then.

292
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:33,271
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

293
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,168
Well, this is an interesting turn.

294
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,530
I'm assuming this is
a live grenade, yes?

295
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,226
Oh, yeah.

296
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:46,465
Well, then, we'll take it.

297
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:48,843
Was the wedding in Philadelphia?

298
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:49,324
I don't know.

299
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,515
I don't care about the wedding.

300
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:52,271
Sir, do you have anything that
might get my buddy's head straight?

301
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,339
He's losing his mind.

302
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:56,323
Got some poppers in the back.

303
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,124
All right.

304
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:58,462
There we go.

305
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,357
All right, Luther, today's the day.

306
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:12,391
You got any plans for the outside?

307
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,194
Yeah, I got some plans.

308
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:21,619
I got some big plans.

309
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,982
I'm gonna throw
this grenade into the car.

310
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,534
The car will explode, and
our problems will be solved.

311
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,643
In the meantime,
I need you to do a popper.

312
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,788
Okay, I understand the plan.

313
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,801
Except for when we find the bride.

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,693
Don't even start, man.

315
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:39,937
- That's a very important part
- You've been talking crazy

316
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,548
- of my plan.
- for way too long,

317
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,004
so just take
a deep breath of this.

318
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:42,789
Inhale.

319
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:45,928
There we go.

320
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:47,319
Grenade.

321
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:49,089
Gonna throw it in the car.

322
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,080
- Yeah, let's do it.
- You and me?

323
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:50,514
I'm back.

324
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:51,774
Let's not talk about
the dress anymore.

325
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:52,432
Okay, here we go.

326
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:53,782
No dress, grenade.

327
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:55,285
Go, move!

328
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:56,341
Go, go, go, go!

329
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,156
This is gonna be awesome,
dude.

330
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:00,802
It's gonna be huge.

331
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:08,401
That's it?

332
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,049
Weird.

333
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:11,724
- That was totally lame.
- That's what grenades do?

334
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,838
- It was a very old grenade.
- What a gyp.

335
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,933
I thought it was gonna be so
much more awesome than that.

336
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:16,966
The car's not even on fire.

337
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:17,894
All right, plan B.

338
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:19,698
Gun, gas tank.

339
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,923
I'm gonna fire directly into it.

340
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,239
- The car's gonna go up.
- Now you're thinking.

341
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:22,885
- Yeah?
- Go, baby.

342
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:23,542
Ready?

343
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,504
You're gonna waste all the
bullets.

344
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:30,538
You got to get a lot closer.

345
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:31,183
Closer?

346
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,074
No, you got to stay far away
cause it's gonna blow up, dude.

347
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:35,350
Chickenshit, I'll walk right
up to that thing and shoot.

348
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:36,981
No, you can't walk right up
to it and shoot.

349
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:37,964
It'll blow you to safety.

350
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,293
All right, how about this?

351
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,268
Popper... put it to my nose.

352
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:44,583
- We'll walk up, and I'll just be...
- That will help you focus.

353
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,714
Okay, well, let's just...

354
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,130
That's at least
the smart thing to do.

355
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,588
Okay, hold on, I'm stepping on
this dress.

356
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,419
One, two...

357
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:51,798
Go.

358
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,471
- Ah, God damn it, dude!
- No more bullets.

359
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,232
Grenades and bullets
don't burn cars?

360
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,524
All right, dude, new plan.

361
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,277
The teeth, the envelope, the crash.
I think it's enough, you know?

362
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,957
You think that's enough?

363
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,059
Maybe the cops will think
we just, like, I don't know...

364
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:06,222
disintegrated?

365
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:07,278
All right, fine.

366
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,462
Then, we'll get these credit cards,
we'll buy some camping equipment.

367
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:10,766
We'll go up to the roof,
and we'll lay low.

368
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,272
See, there's my boy.
He's making plans again.

369
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:13,588
- He's thinking.
- He's back!

370
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:16,147
He's also wearing a wedding dress,
though, and I'd like him to take it off.

371
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,593
Oh, yeah, this is outrageous.

372
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:18,509
That's completely crazy, man.

373
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:25,020
This is it.

374
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:27,549
Uh, I'm starting to have
second thoughts about

375
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:28,929
this sex party thing, Frank.

376
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:32,287
Dennis, what, are you having
second thoughts about the glory hole?

377
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:34,447
And now you're gonna be skittish
about the sex party?

378
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,069
Don't...

379
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,828
You said you wanted
to have anonymous sex.

380
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,069
This is the place.

381
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,128
I do want to have anonymous sex.
I want to have anonymous sex.

382
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,684
I want to have a sex party.
I want it all.

383
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:43,928
I want the glory hole.
I want all those things.

384
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:44,351
Here it is.

385
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,336
What I'm having a hard time
believing, though, Frank,

386
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,588
is that there is an elite secret
sex society behind that door,

387
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:50,404
in this building.

388
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,972
I used to run with this crew.

389
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,969
These people are the most
powerful, influential,

390
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:57,073
sexiest people in Philadelphia.

391
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,783
Well, then, why are they having
a goddamn orgy in such a dump then?

392
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:02,260
I thought this kind of thing went down
in, like, somebody's elegant mansion.

393
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,275
I was looking forward to that.

394
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,185
No, nobody's gonna have
an orgy in their mansion.

395
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,125
All over their nice furniture?
I mean, that doesn't make sense.

396
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,036
Well, no, it doesn't.
That's a really good point.

397
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:11,600
All right, let's do it.

398
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,945
Yeah, all right, put your mask on,
and don't embarrass me.

399
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,753
All right.
Don't embarrass yourself.

400
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:25,466
What is the password?

401
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,886
Orgy...

402
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:34,931
You may enter.

403
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,031
Orgy?
Seriously?

404
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,867
What the hell is this place?
What did you bring me to?

405
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,630
This is a buffet.

406
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:52,729
Well, I can see that it's a
buffet, but why is there a buffet

407
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,369
at a goddamn orgy, Frank?

408
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,608
You don't want to bang on
an empty stomach, do you?

409
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,261
I don't want to bang any of
these people anyway.

410
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:00,140
They're all paunchy
and weird and old.

411
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,844
You can't tell under the masks.

412
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,151
I can absolutely tell.

413
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,737
And why are our costumes so much
more elaborate than everybody

414
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,498
else's like they didn't put
any effort into it?

415
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,861
Ah, Jesus Christ, that guy's
not even wearing a mask.

416
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,555
He's got the right idea.

417
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,072
This beak is interfering
with my nosh.

418
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,246
What are you doing?
Don't take it off.

419
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:17,651
Ah, Jesus,
what are we doing here, man?

420
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,797
How is this even an orgy?
Nobody's having sex.

421
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,203
What did you bring me to?

422
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:22,268
You brought me...
what is this, like...

423
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,215
It's like a half nude buffet party.

424
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,078
Oh, it's not exactly what I thought
it was gonna be, either, but it's okay.

425
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:27,812
There's a lot of food.

426
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,415
Frank, I think we can both
agree this is not the kind of

427
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:31,828
anonymous sex that
we're looking for, right?

428
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,416
You want to go down by the bridge?

429
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:36,245
What in God's name could
possibly be down by the bridge?

430
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:37,783
I don't know.
It could be cool.

431
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,274
It could be cool?

432
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,669
No, Frank, I don't want to go
down by the bridge.

433
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:42,902
You know what,
I'm going back to the bar.

434
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,158
I'm gonna go back
to the glory hole.

435
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,025
That's something that I feel like
I could wrap my head around.

436
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,062
This is ridiculous.

437
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,197
You think these are fresh
shrimp or frozen shrimp?

438
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,417
I don't care!

439
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,563
What is this place?
These are not...

440
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,689
Who are these people?

441
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:55,675
It's like a bad acid trip in here.

442
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,236
I'm coming.
I'm gonna come.

443
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,428
Now, what if I just slip my
foot over like this, as if to say,

444
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,874
"Hello, I'd like to have
some anonymous sex please."

445
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,157
All right, I'm into that.

446
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,694
Then, I wait for the signal back.

447
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:16,306
If it's a lady's foot,
I'm in the clear!

448
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,621
But, Frank, here's
my problem with that.

449
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:18,954
A man can wear a woman's shoe.

450
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:20,146
You can't rule out trickery.

451
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,566
I mean that's why we need
the viewing slot.

452
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,649
The slot defeats the purpose.

453
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,798
I could see your eyes.
We might as well get married!

454
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,402
It's the safest way, Frank.

455
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,643
Dennis, if I was looking for safe,

456
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:33,731
I wouldn't be sticking
my dick through a wall.

457
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:35,528
You guys, get out here right now.

458
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:36,666
You need to take a look at this.

459
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,841
Good news, Dee, we made
the bathroom unisex.

460
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,608
Glory hole's up and running, baby.

461
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:42,697
I don't care about that.

462
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,762
According to
the Philadelphia Police Department,

463
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,194
Mac and Charlie are dead.

464
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,114
You got the camera, man?

465
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:51,123
- Yeah, is it ready?
- Yeah I think so.

466
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:51,957
We good, are we on?

467
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,821
Dennis and Frank, if you're watching
this, then we're already dead.

468
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:56,918
Our lives were horrible.

469
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:59,242
Horrible and sad,
so we decided to end it all.

470
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,028
Not me actually, my life
was pretty sweet.

471
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:03,720
But Charlie and I had a suicide pact,
and I have to honor that

472
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,476
because I am honorable man.

473
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,594
I will die an honorable man.

474
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:10,964
There's also a will enclosed and
you totally have to do all of that

475
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,032
because that's like a law.

476
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,117
Okay, wait a second.
My life was also very honorable.

477
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:14,727
Here we go!

478
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,181
I can't believe they're dead.

479
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,641
I can't believe they didn't
include me in their suicide pact.

480
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:27,155
What?

481
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,457
Are you crazy?

482
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,851
They're not dead, they're
definitely doing something stupid,

483
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,184
- but they're not dead.
- You saw the tape, Dee!

484
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,421
My best friends
went on a blaze of glory

485
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:35,750
and they didn't even ask me
to be part of it.

486
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,437
This is terrible!

487
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:37,654
Are you buying this?

488
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,011
That is ridiculous, Dennis,
they left us a list of demands.

489
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:42,988
What are you talking about?

490
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,977
That's their last will and
testament. That is not demands.

491
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,673
It says at the top :
"List of demands."

492
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,841
Well, whatever, it's their wishes
and we have to honor them.

493
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:53,775
Oh, we do? Oh we do,
we have to honor them?

494
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,818
Okay, let's see, Frank.

495
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:58,508
Charlie's number one : my ashes
are to be made into a tea and

496
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,781
to be dranken by everyone in bar.

497
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:01,760
Done!

498
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,463
Damn it, gross, fine, what else?

499
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,016
Mac's number one.

500
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,320
In lieu of a body, which was
most likely blown up

501
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:10,963
in the most awesome way imaginable,
I would like the duster to be burned

502
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:14,036
and its ashes buried in an unmarked
grave somewhere by the river.

503
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,973
Well, that's crazy.

504
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:17,248
I'm not gonna burn
or bury the duster.

505
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:20,773
Yeah, we also both have to name
our first born child Murphy

506
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:22,189
because that was Robocop's name.

507
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,757
Goddamn it!

508
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,448
Mac is dead and
he's still bossing me around.

509
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:25,563
Mac is not dead, Dennis.

510
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,086
How could you be so cold?

511
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,463
They blew up my car!

512
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:29,920
Not burning the duster.

513
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,407
- You're still talking about a coat?
- Absolutely!

514
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,404
That is an automobile.

515
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,450
<i>- It's a piece of clothing!
- They're people!</i>

516
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,109
<i>- They're all lying!
- They're lying people!</i>

517
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:41,374
Jesus, man, they must be
really broken up.

518
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:42,742
We can hear 'em from up here.

519
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,120
They're like crying
and whing and...

520
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:45,932
I'm excited about the hot dogs.

521
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,462
- Oh, crap!
- What?

522
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:49,218
We should've got beans, dude.

523
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:51,113
Hobos are always eating beans.

524
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:51,834
Damn.

525
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:53,053
We'll be fine without
the beans, all right,

526
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,551
cause this is a perfect,
perfect hiding spot.

527
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,249
This would be better
with beans though.

528
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:58,493
Leave it alone with the beans.

529
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,191
No! Stop it! Don't do it.

530
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:03,926
Oh, my God.

531
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,059
How? How is that possible?

532
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:06,937
I don't know.

533
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:08,510
Just put it down.

534
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:09,561
You think they're my baby teeth?

535
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:10,667
Put it with the other ones.

536
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,060
You're not gonna be able to
eat this hot dog.

537
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:15,949
I'll suck it down.

538
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,834
<i>I asked you to leave me be.</i>

539
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:27,636
<i>I asked you to let me live my life.</i>

540
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,859
<i>But you wouldn't go away.</i>

541
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,251
<i>You kept pushing, and pushing,</i>

542
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:40,522
<i>until you forced me
to do something drastic...</i>

543
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:46,335
<i>Something I was hoping
I would never have to do...</i>

544
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,583
Well, I guess this is probably,
this is probably gonna be it

545
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,437
so we should,
we should get started.

546
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:03,661
What to say about Mac.

547
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,649
He certainly was...

548
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:11,198
angry.

549
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:13,926
- Burn the duster!
- I'm not burning the duster!

550
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,793
Okay, I'm not burning the duster.

551
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:19,793
All right, that's crazy.
That's like, that's insane.

552
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,002
Why would I ever burn,
I mean, come on.

553
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:24,163
I will continue to wear it,
in his honor.

554
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,723
And I will burn some other things.
You know maybe like these,

555
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:28,644
stupid goddamn sleeveless t-shirts

556
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,955
that he wants retired
and hung up in the bar.

557
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,996
I'll burn these. But I am not
burning the duster, okay?

558
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,133
So forget it. It probably
won't even burn anyway.

559
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:37,532
It's not supposed to...
it's flame-retardant.

560
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:38,549
That's like the whole point.

561
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:42,705
It's like a shield of armor, so stop
asking me to burn the duster.

562
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:44,203
I'm not gonna burn it!

563
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:51,950
So, end of story, you know.
Let's just move on.

564
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,970
So...

565
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,269
Yeah, all right.

566
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:03,736
Well, uh, thank you.

567
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,018
Come on.

568
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:10,899
No.

569
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,185
- I'm not doing it.
- Come on.

570
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,698
Deandra, get on that stage.

571
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,501
Before, uh, Mac and Charlie died
they made a slideshow.

572
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:25,512
And, uh, we're going to play
a song that was a favorite of theirs.

573
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:26,831
Go ahead.

574
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,356
<i>It's all the same</i>

575
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:34,793
<i>Only the names have changed</i>

576
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,475
<i>Every day, it seems we're
wasting away</i>

577
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:43,612
<i>Another place,</i>

578
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:47,701
<i>where the faces are so cold</i>

579
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,632
<i>I'd drive all night,</i>

580
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:53,894
<i>just to get back home</i>

581
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,299
<i>I'm a cowboy,</i>

582
00:21:56,437 --> 00:22:00,676
<i>on a steel horse I ride</i>

583
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:05,324
<i>I'm wanted, dead or alive...</i>

584
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,077
I miss you, Charlie.

585
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,047
This is bullshit, dude.

586
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,611
No one's mourning me properly.

587
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:13,757
What are you talking about, man?
Your mom's sitting right there.

588
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,027
She's mourning you.

589
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,402
Yeah, she watched an entire episode
of Mama's Familyand fell asleep.

590
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:22,044
And now, I'm going to give
them the one gun salute.

591
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:23,257
No, you're not!

592
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:25,805
All right. Oh, my God!
Let go!

593
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:29,435
Wow, that was great
and very touching.

594
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:32,070
Thanks so much for coming,
both of you.

595
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:33,559
Time to go.

596
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,274
See you at the next one.

597
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:39,313
Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie, aww,
it's going to be okay.

598
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:42,429
I'll tell you what, why don't
you go into the bathroom,

599
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:45,880
go into the center stall,
I got a little surprise for you.

600
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:47,552
It's going to cheer you up.

601
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:50,722
That's okay, Frankie.
I don't need to go potty.

602
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,207
Oh, damn it.

603
00:22:58,017 --> 00:23:00,577
Can you believe it, sis?
They're actually gone.

604
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,269
- This changes everything.
- I need a ride home.

605
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:05,759
No, no, no.
Can't do that, sis.

606
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:09,129
I got to get back home ASAP and
meet a couple potential new roommates.

607
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:10,744
Hot ones!
You know what I'm saying?

608
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,116
All right, hey,
it's time to move on.

609
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:29,297
Would you mind not breathing
directly into my mouth?

610
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,578
No thoughts on that?

611
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,099
You're not going to say anything?
You're just going to stare at me?

612
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,523
That's what you're bringing
to the table? That's great.

613
00:23:39,606 --> 00:23:41,585
I'm gonna... could you excuse me?

614
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,257
Excuse me.

615
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,470
Sir... Goddamn.

616
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,070
Thanks, I'm just gonna...

617
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,122
Excuse me.

618
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,967
No, of course, let me do it.

619
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:02,718
Thanks.

620
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:04,209
Hi.

621
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,156
Oh, my God, freak show back there.

622
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:11,313
Ma'am, I'm going to need for you
to step behind the line.

623
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:14,308
Yeah, look, as you can probably tell,
I'm not really a bus person.

624
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:17,471
It's just, a couple of dicks
destroyed my car and then forced me

625
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:20,583
to lower myself to this, so if you could
just cut me some slack, because...

626
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,436
I don't know if you've been
back there, but animals.

627
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,853
You're touching me. That doesn't...
this isn't weird for you?

628
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:28,816
Ma'am, either you get behind
the line or your ride ends here.

629
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,843
- I'm behind the line.
- You're on the line.

630
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,797
On the line, behind the line,
who cares?!

631
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,244
That's it.
I'm pulling the bus over.

632
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:37,472
No, goddamn it, don't pull
the bus over, all right?

633
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:38,520
Really?!

634
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,235
Okay, fine, you know what?

635
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:43,370
I will go back behind the line with
the rest of the filthy degenerates.

636
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,082
But I am not happy about it, lady.

637
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:46,850
Excuse me!

638
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:48,798
Oh, my... really?

639
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:49,814
Oh, my God.

640
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,863
Oh, no, you stay put. I'll get it.

641
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:53,365
On the floor of a bus...

642
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,220
On the floor of a filthy bus.

643
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:56,994
Excuse me for just a sec!

644
00:24:57,674 --> 00:24:58,684
Damn it, dude.

645
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,170
I can't believe Dee finally caught on
and cancelled her credit cards.

646
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:03,179
This is really not good, dude.
Now we don't have any beans.

647
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,468
We don't have any beer, dude.
We're shit out of luck, bro.

648
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:06,668
All right, I'll tell you what.
We'll get back to the bar.

649
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,493
We'll get some beer there,
at least we'll have that.

650
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,338
Not a bad idea.

651
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,343
In the meantime,
I need a popper, all right.

652
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,342
I got to get my head straight.

653
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:13,771
I got a little bad news
on the popper front.

654
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:15,453
- This is the last one, dude.
- Shit! Really?

655
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,986
All right, well,
I think I should get it.

656
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,951
- Not going to have it.
- Can I just have it?

657
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,234
- Bro?
- Can I just have it?

658
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:25,926
- Will you let me do the poppers?
- I just want it.

659
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:27,594
- I just need it, dude.
- The poppers person.

660
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,690
Give me the popper, dude!
I need that popper, bro!

661
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:34,699
I got to have the popper!

662
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,367
Oh, you son of a bitches!

663
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,599
Hey, look out.
Look out!

664
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,773
Hey, you jerks!

665
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,923
Goddamn it!

666
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,044
Hey! No, stop the bus!
Stop the bus!

667
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,401
Shut up!

668
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:54,481
You shut up, bitch!

669
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:56,045
Stop the bus!

670
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,660
Sir? Sir, I just... I need to pull
the cord to get off the bus.

671
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,273
This is my stop.
You're in my way.

672
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,686
Can you get out of the way
so I can pull the cord?

673
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,350
I'll get out of your way as soon
as I get off...

674
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:06,871
Oh, my God, what is
wrong with you?

675
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:08,667
Goddamn it, you bitches!

676
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,072
Good-bye, Mac's shit.

677
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,612
Good-bye, Mac's shit.
Good-bye, Mac's shit.

678
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,951
Good-bye... come on, dude.

679
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:35,945
When were you ever going to use
nunchakus? Are you kidding me?

680
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:41,147
Yeah, hang on one second.

681
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:46,965
Yeah, it's perfect.

682
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:49,572
Hello.

683
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,863
Uh, hi.
Um, can I help you?

684
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:54,274
You're
looking for a roommate, right?

685
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:58,184
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was looking
for two, actually. Female.

686
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,849
I believe I was pretty clear
in the ad here.

687
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:04,054
"Male, 30, looking for
Three's Company type deal.

688
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:06,508
Did Odd Couplething for past decade,
looking for something new."

689
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,504
Yeah, I did the Three's
Company thing once.

690
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,627
It was pretty cool for like a week,
and then I banged one of them.

691
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,926
- Oh... nice.
- Not nice.

692
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:16,829
Do you know what this is like?
Banging the chicks that you live with?

693
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,000
It's terrible, man.

694
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:20,363
Every day you have to deal
with this.

695
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:23,497
Get out, lady.

696
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:26,798
Wow, yeah, I guess I never
really thought about that before.

697
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:30,106
You know, you're... you're much
smarter than my old roommate.

698
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,840
Yeah, look, I'm going to be
upfront with you.

699
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,330
I run with a pretty wild crew.

700
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:39,072
There's probably going to be chicks
over here, like, all the time.

701
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,226
I'm into some pretty crazy shit.

702
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:45,382
Here's the best part: I don't
even know most of their names.

703
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,444
Oh, yes! It's like...

704
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:51,898
You know, I've been trying to get
into the anonymous sex thing lately.

705
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:54,399
- Oh, yeah?
- Now, are you, uh, European?

706
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:56,575
Oh, I'm sorry.
What gave it away?

707
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:02,852
Nice. Yeah, well, you know,
I could probably consider, like,

708
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:04,943
a, uh,Perfect Strangers type
of deal.

709
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:08,964
Look, I like this by the way.
This is a sweet duster.

710
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,731
First, he doesn't burn the duster, and
now he's looking for new roommates?

711
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,809
Why did you want to burn that
duster anyway?

712
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:24,438
Because he always wears it with
no shirt and a shitload of cologne.

713
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,496
It's totally ruined.

714
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,931
- Hello, bitches!
- Jesus Christ, Dee!

715
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:30,097
You scared the shit out of me.
I almost dropped all my beer.

716
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,364
I knew you two weren't dead.

717
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,075
What are you doing popping
out of our tent? Not cool, Dee!

718
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:36,344
Oh, not cool? Oh, I'll tell you
what's not cool.

719
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:40,065
Crashing my car into a building,
exploding a grenade inside of it

720
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:42,824
and then convincing your friends
your family that you're dead.

721
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:45,714
That's one of the cooler
things you could ever do.

722
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:47,019
That's really unbelievably
cool.

723
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,155
- I suggest you try it...
- Cooler than I thought it was.

724
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:50,411
I don't know why
you're up here doing

725
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:51,726
whatever it is that you're doing,
and I don't care.

726
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,361
What I do care about,
is my 1997 Dodge Neon.

727
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:55,408
So here's the deal.

728
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,941
You two monkeys are going to get
me a new 1997 Dodge Neon,

729
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:01,617
or I'm going to go and tell Frank and
Dennis that you faked your own deaths

730
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,098
and you're hiding up on the roof.

731
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,721
Well, now you're just talking crazy.
You can't buy a new 1997 Dodge Neon.

732
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:09,929
- You can buy an old one...
- Okay, new to me.

733
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:13,592
Dee, you got bigger problems,
because my dad just got out of jail,

734
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:14,468
and he's coming to kill you.

735
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:15,942
What?!
Me?

736
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:16,838
Are you sure?

737
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,670
Kill you, kill us,
kill everybody really.

738
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:19,614
He's going to kill everyone.

739
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:22,040
Why would you not tell me
this news earlier?

740
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:24,531
Oh, my God, get off our case,
Dee, all right? What's done is done.

741
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,341
Look, Mac and I are hobo
drifters now, okay?

742
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:27,938
We don't dwell on the past.

743
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:29,709
No, hobo drifters
live in the present.

744
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,891
So look, if you really want
to get back at Frank and Dennis,

745
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,312
you got to fake your own death.

746
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:35,087
I don't want to get back
at Frank and Dennis.

747
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,570
I want to get at you two.

748
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:38,404
Really is that what...?

749
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:39,943
What? Is that what
your plan was?

750
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,441
I tuned out during
the whole tirade.

751
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:43,906
She said the 1997 Dodge Neon
thing and I totally lost her.

752
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,224
All right, Dee, I'll tell you
what, here's the plan.

753
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:48,254
Why don't you fake your own
death like us?

754
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,872
It really is the only thing you can do
now 'cause you're in this too deep.

755
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,825
Look, you want to die?

756
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,721
Now... what's your bean situation?

757
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:59,046
You got some beans on you,
or what's up?

758
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:10,994
Good-bye, son.

759
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:28,127
Aw, man, I got to tell you,
this is awesome.

760
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,706
It's making me forget
that Mac ever even died.

761
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:32,525
Oh, yeah, just relax,
roommate.

762
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,992
I'm going to relax.

763
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,141
I'm going to relax all over
the place in a second.

764
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:39,981
Shit. Jan?

765
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:42,563
All right, I got to get this.

766
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:45,987
Hey, Dennis.

767
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,027
Really? What do you want?

768
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,453
Hey, I just wanted to let you
know I was going to go for

769
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:50,214
a quick jog in Fairmont Park
by myself.

770
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:51,599
Oh, yeah? Great.
Okay, have fun.

771
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:52,527
But, it's kind of dangerous.

772
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:53,449
Yeah, I got it, Dee.

773
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,432
- I don't know if you noticed...
- Go jogging! Ang go !

774
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:56,525
What's this have to do with me?

775
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:59,773
Just me out there in the middle of
the night in the dark by myself. Really?

776
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,114
Sorry about her, I...

777
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:04,652
She was a bag... I hate her.

778
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:10,120
Which one do you want first?
Huh, Greta or Sasha?

779
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,835
Oh, no. No, shit, bro.
Why'd you do that, bro?

780
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:12,764
Come here, man.

781
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,171
- What did I do?
- You said their names.

782
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:17,167
Come on, man,
that kills it for me.

783
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:19,563
Look, bro,
can I be honest with you?

784
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:22,395
This is great and all, but I was
really hoping for more of like a,

785
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:26,425
you know, anything goes, crazy
European sex party kind of a thing.

786
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:28,410
- Something a little kinkier.
- Kinky ?

787
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,348
Oh, kinky. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I like this.

788
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,398
You like this, we like this.

789
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,900
Yeah, let me make some calls.

790
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,584
Do you think you could put
something like that together?

791
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,528
Of course I can, man.
I'm European.

792
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:42,738
Oh! That's...

793
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,059
It looks like he's got
a lot of new friends.

794
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,445
Yes, I can see that, Charlie.

795
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:52,541
Some of them
are really pretty girls.

796
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,285
Yes, they are very pretty.

797
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:56,205
Wow, that's tough, man.
That's a tough thing to see.

798
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,001
Shut up, dude.

799
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,926
I'll bet you Frank
is throwing a party, too.

800
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,648
It's your turn to take
the bedpan out tonight.

801
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,507
"Little freak!
I did it last time!"

802
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,369
No, Charlie, I got up in
the middle of the night,

803
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:12,346
and I walked down
the hallway with the bedpan.

804
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:17,339
"All right, Frank, I'll do it,
only because I like you so much".

805
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:24,513
I like you, too, Charlie.
I like you, too, New Charlie.

806
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,665
You know what, man?
I'm kicking it up a notch.

807
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,997
- We're haunting these bitches.
- Haunting's cool, man.

808
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,579
- Coming back from the grave, bitch.
- All right, that's cool.

809
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,825
What is this? What are you doing,
like Poltergeistor something?

810
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:39,947
- Awesome, right?
- No, no.

811
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,158
Craig T. Nelson.

812
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:43,289
Craig T. Nelson is the best,
dude, but Poltergeist?

813
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,388
- What ?
- It's not scary.

814
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,494
It's all about psychological damage.

815
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:48,668
Big deal, look at me.

816
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:50,699
Psychological damage up to here.

817
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,155
It doesn't do anything for me,
you know?

818
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,694
Physical damage, that's what's
gonna irritate people.

819
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:55,728
All right, what do you
suggest?

820
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:58,623
Well, I mean, if anything, maybe
we tie some knives to our fingers

821
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,824
and we get a little more serious
about this whole murder thing.

822
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:02,197
- Haunting.
- Haunting!

823
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,198
- We're gonna haunt them.
- I'm sorry, I was thinking...

824
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,230
Oh, my God, I'm so happy to
see you.

825
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,082
Oh, God, I had the weirdest night.
It was crazy.

826
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:11,513
As soon as I left Dennis's place,
I realized I don't have a car,

827
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:13,815
right, so I actually do
have to run home by myself

828
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:15,082
through the park in the middle
of the night.

829
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,590
So I'm on Spring Garden Street,
and this big car full of gangbangers...

830
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,391
Okay, gangbangers.
That is an awesome story, Dee.

831
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:21,460
That's the end of it, right?
That could be the end of the story?

832
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,026
Charlie and I are right in
the middle of something.

833
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,396
Check it out, we're gonna
put some knives on our fingers

834
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,291
and start murdering people.

835
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,400
- Haunting people.
- Haunting.

836
00:33:26,514 --> 00:33:27,265
- We're gonna haunt people.
- Whatever.

837
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:28,625
You're gonna do like a
Poltergeistthing?

838
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:31,534
- That's Dennis.
- That's Dennis.

839
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:39,677
Hey, ladies, like I said,
pop them off.

840
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,357
Start popping them off.

841
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,421
Oh, I love it, I love it.
Hey, feel free to be free.

842
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:48,842
No American judgments here. The only
rule is: don't tell me your names.

843
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:51,233
I don't want to know your names,
okay?

844
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:54,912
"Hi, I'm Charlie.
Frankie, I love these girls."

845
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:56,982
Frank, what are you doing, man ?

846
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:59,491
You're freaking the girls out
with this mannequin. Get rid of it.

847
00:33:59,574 --> 00:34:04,190
Dennis, these girls are German.
German.

848
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:07,045
"We're gonna have demented sex,
right, Frank?"

849
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,572
That is the greatest party
I've ever seen. These sons of bitches!

850
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:15,036
Is he gonna take that stupid
little mannequin everywhere, man?

851
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,095
- That is freaking me out.
- Move past the mannequin.

852
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:18,712
They're just hanging out with
a bunch of half naked ladies,

853
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:20,753
and I just ran and sweated for
absolutely nothing?

854
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:22,280
Yeah, I don't sound like
that, all right.

855
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:24,144
- Goddamn it. Get past it.
- Who cares about the mannequin?

856
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:25,261
I care about the mannequin!

857
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:26,969
I look like a jerk
in front of those girls.

858
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:28,551
I'm putting an end to this right
now.

859
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,262
Yeah, dude, screw your dad.
Let him eat our asses.

860
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:31,903
Let him eat my butt
into smithereens.

861
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:32,809
I'm ending this.

862
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:36,968
Let's not be rash, right?
I mean, come on.

863
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,739
Look, if we're not gonna haunt them,
we should have a little fun, right?

864
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:41,211
Let's scare the shit out of
them.

865
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:44,991
- We got to make an entrance.
- Oh, let's scare the shit out of them.

866
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:56,988
Jan, this is what I want, man.
You've given me what I want.

867
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:01,829
Look, I have this very kinky
surprise for you, my friend.

868
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:06,241
I've arranged for you to use
the glory hole!

869
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,443
I forgot about the glory hole.

870
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:12,074
- I just sent someone in there now.
- Yeah ?

871
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:13,859
Totally anonymous.

872
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,059
There are no words, man.

873
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:23,944
That's right, I'm the boss.

874
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,813
But I'm a good boss, and
I'm gonna allow you to watch.

875
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:32,468
"Okay, Frankie!"
Somebody's coming.

876
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:38,638
Any minute now, the German broad
is gonna knock on that wall,

877
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:44,004
which is my signal to go in my
pants, take out my penis

878
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:46,319
and stick it through the hole.

879
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,075
Then, she can go to town.

880
00:35:49,158 --> 00:35:51,670
Hey, honey, you want to take
care of this monster for me or what ?

881
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:55,318
There is no way I can picture
that is a girl.

882
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,101
What the hell
are you doing here, man?

883
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,391
- Jan sent me.
- Jan sent me, too.

884
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:04,495
This is bad.

885
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:06,254
Everybody out!

886
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:09,207
Okay, there has been
a major miscommunication.

887
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:13,863
Get your European, sex-freaky
asses out of the bar.

888
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:16,009
Let's go, come on.
Come on, move it.

889
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,319
Move it, that's right.
Go, go, go!

890
00:36:17,402 --> 00:36:18,165
Get out!

891
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:19,527
Let's go, ladies.
Let's go, let's go.

892
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,170
Get out, get out,
get out, get out.

893
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:23,558
- Hey, you too, Jan.
- Hey, beat it.

894
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:25,938
- What did I do?
- What did you do?

895
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:28,572
Jan, you were gonna have him
"glory hole" me.

896
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:30,939
- Yeah.
- Yeah, my ass. Get out of here.

897
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,925
You sex freak, go!

898
00:36:32,008 --> 00:36:33,232
Americans are so uptight.

899
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,020
You ruined our glory hole.
Beat it and shut the door.

900
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:37,529
Sick freak.

901
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,318
You didn't know anything...

902
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:39,504
Weirdo.
What ?

903
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:43,658
Surprise, bitches!

904
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,462
We're alive, and it's blowing
your minds right now.

905
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,440
No, it is not blowing
our minds at all.

906
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:53,220
I knew you guys were alive.

907
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:56,801
Yeah, I knew you guys were
alive, okay?

908
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,155
I figured it out right before
the funeral.

909
00:36:58,859 --> 00:36:59,540
How?

910
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:01,407
'Cause I could hear you guys
rustling around in the vents.

911
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,334
You were speaking at full
volume, okay?

912
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,123
Did you think you were being,
like, crafty?

913
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:06,845
I could see you staring at me
through the window.

914
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,339
You know I can see through
my windows, right?

915
00:37:08,422 --> 00:37:10,450
- I wanted to piss you off.
- Well, what about me?

916
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:11,518
Did you want to piss me off?

917
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:14,542
You, I thought, might
have actually been murdered.

918
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,101
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought, okay?

919
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,243
Frank, you knew, too?

920
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:19,407
Yeah... I knew.

921
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:26,202
And some of the stuff you've been doing
with this mannequin here, that's like...

922
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,080
to teach me a lesson or...?

923
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:36,341
Did I see you bang that thing?

924
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:37,652
All right, you know what,
let's just...

925
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,192
But why were you guys pretending
that you were dead anyway?

926
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,650
That's a really messed
up thing to do.

927
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:44,057
My dad got out on parole.
He's coming to kill me and Charlie.

928
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,890
No, no, you got a letter
the other day.

929
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,690
- He sent a letter.
- Who sent a letter?

930
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:50,121
I got it, I got it.
It was sent to the bar.

931
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,036
"Dear son, I asked you
to leave me be...

932
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:58,435
forced me to do something that
I hoped I'd never have to do."

933
00:37:58,665 --> 00:37:59,863
Oh, yeah, here we go.

934
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,653
"I just got out of prison,
and I'm heading to Tijuana.

935
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,580
I wanted to get as far away
from you as I could,

936
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,788
so that I could learn
how to forgive you.

937
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:10,817
Please do not try
to contact me ever.

938
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:13,143
I promise that
I'm not gonna hurt you.

939
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,142
Love, Dad.

940
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,959
P.S. : I still love you."

941
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,819
See, 'cause we...

942
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,895
- This whole thing was...
- We didn't have to do all the...

943
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:29,537
Sorry about your car, Dee.

944
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,706
