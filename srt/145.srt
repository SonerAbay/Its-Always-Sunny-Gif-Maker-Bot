1
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:02,614
I hope they don't show us

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,406
some boring art house movie.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,141
Well, the title of
the movie is terrible.

4
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:07,943
I mean, Focus Group? What is that?

5
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,978
Focus Group isn't the
title of the movie.

6
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,280
- We're in a focus group.
- Huh?

7
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:15,617
Charlie, we're here to watch,
analyze, critique,

8
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,085
and then, most importantly, judge

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,787
whatever film we're gonna be shown.

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,156
Uh, these filmmakers...
they need valuable input,

11
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,623
and we have been carefully
selected to provide it.

12
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:24,726
We were walking out of the mall,

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,928
and they offered us
Red Lobster gift cards.

14
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:28,845
Nevertheless, you know,
they've chosen wisely.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,131
Uh, good afternoon, everyone.

16
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,267
I-I want to thank you
for joining us today.

17
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,504
Now, your feedback
is very important to us.

18
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,672
- Sweet.
- I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:37,973
I'm just a little confused here,

20
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,140
'cause I can't follow this movie.

21
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,381
The movie hasn't started yet.

22
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,612
Yeah, uh, Moderator, not to worry.

23
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:46,482
I-I just want to assure you that
your movie is in good hands.

24
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:47,816
Y-You've chosen wisely.

25
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:50,652
See, I, myself, am a prolific filmmaker.

26
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,155
In fact, while you don't thrill me,

27
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,458
I might even consider
you for one of my roles.

28
00:00:56,492 --> 00:01:00,195
Well, thank you, um,
but I'm not really a performer.

29
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,531
I'll get a performance out of you.

30
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:06,301
- Uh, where will we appear in the credits?
- In the credits?

31
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:07,703
- Are we gonna be at the front?
- Yeah, for our contribution.

32
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:08,737
- Sort of the beginning of the film, or...?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,006
Well, you-you will not be.

34
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,676
But your opinions are valuable to us.

35
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,344
- And you're gonna get a lot of them.
- Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:19,035
I'm already tearing this
entire experience apart.

37
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,881
- As am I.
- Me, too.

38
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:21,149
- Why don't we just start?
- I'll tell you what. Why don't you

39
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,718
- just go ahead and show us
- Let's just, let's see.

40
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,486
whatever piece of shit you're
gonna show us, you know,

41
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,054
- Yeah.
- so we can tear it apart and get out to Red Lobster?

42
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,323
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
- Okay.

43
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:31,026
So the title of the film is...

44
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:34,596
Thunder Gun 4: Maximum Cool.

45
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,864
- Oh!
- What?!

46
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:38,199
- Really?!
- Holy...

47
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:41,293
_

48
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,981
Uh... uh...

49
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,484
What was that?

50
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,553
I, uh... I'm not sure.

51
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:18,489
- Uh...
- I-I was totally lost.

52
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,891
Did they make Thunder Gun bad?

53
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:23,160
- Yeah.
- Okay. So,

54
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,528
that was our movie.

55
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,430
Now, clearly, the film is not done,

56
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:27,531
but still a work in progress.

57
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,999
- Oh.
- Oh, thank God!

58
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,068
- Okay, great.
- Oh, Jesus.

59
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,405
Okay, so let's adjourn to the conference
room to begin our session.

60
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,739
- Let's get into it. Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's-let's fix it.

61
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,408
- We can, uh, we can fix it.
- Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,542
Okay, why don't we just

63
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,444
break it down, act by act?

64
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,446
I'll play back a scene
from the first act,

65
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,348
and then we can discuss.

66
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,784
- Yeah, okay. All right.
- Okay.

67
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,493
♪ Train roll on... ♪

68
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,030
- Excuse me.
- ♪ On down the line... ♪

69
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:02,732
Is your name John? John ThunderGun?

70
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:08,705
Mm. Maybe once.

71
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:10,573
Not anymore.

72
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,409
I'm Dr. Ling.

73
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,378
This is my assistant Max.

74
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:18,015
I'm head of research and
development for Com-Tec.

75
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,549
We need your help.

76
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:21,584
Why?

77
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,521
You got a bottle of whiskey
that needs draining?

78
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,689
A man named Colonel Washington
has stolen a formula

79
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,425
from our lab.

80
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,660
In the wrong hands,
this formula could be used

81
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,495
as a powerful weapon.

82
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,932
A weapon that could
destroy millions of lives.

83
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,168
We need it back,
but he wants something from us.

84
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:42,172
Oh, yeah? What's that?

85
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,075
Not what, but who.

86
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,912
I am Colonel Washington.

87
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:52,215
You know my reputation,
so you'll give me what I seek.

88
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,884
Where is ThunderGun?

89
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,020
Right here.

90
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,556
Me.

91
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,158
I am ThunderGun.

92
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,527
I am ThunderGun.

93
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,629
I am ThunderGun.

94
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,897
I am ThunderGun!

95
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,732
I am ThunderGun!

96
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,269
I am ThunderGun! I am ThunderGun!

97
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,585
I am...

98
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,874
Okay, who has questions about the setup?

99
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,077
- Mm.
- Oh.

100
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,544
- Me, me, me, me!
- Yeah.

101
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:24,647
- Um, let's start with you.
- What's being set up?

102
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,160
Um... the entire movie.

103
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:28,385
The, uh...

104
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,653
So, the main characters,
the story, the villain.

105
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,422
That's where you lost me.
Who's the bad guy?

106
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,591
Well, Colonel Washington, obviously.

107
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,059
That's not clear.

108
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:38,428
In the old movies,
the good guy wore white,

109
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:41,598
the bad guy wore black, or was black.

110
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,134
Well, depending on the hero.

111
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,402
Right? It's-it's not a racial thing.

112
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,903
- Mm.
- It's about opposites.

113
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,938
See, I want the bad guy
to be different than me

114
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,907
- so I know why I hate him.
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,475
- Mm.
- I hate people who are different than me.

116
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,477
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Like Rocky one.

117
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,113
Bad guy was black.

118
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,747
Rocky II... another black guy.

119
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,118
Rocky III...
different black guy with a mohawk.

120
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,685
- Right.
- Yeah, but in Die Hard,

121
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,187
- the bad guy was foreign, right?
- Hmm.

122
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,422
- Yeah.
- So I know why I hate him.

123
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:06,589
- There we go.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:08,625
People hate foreigners.

125
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:09,993
- Right. - Yeah, we hate them.
- Right? So in Thunder Gun,

126
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,194
you don't have to do
any reshoots, right?

127
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,229
- Yeah.
- Don't-don't make him black.

128
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,998
- Just give him an accent.
- What kind of accent?

129
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,766
What about Australian?
That's pretty foreign.

130
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,035
No, that's not gonna work.

131
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,702
'Cause they're white.

132
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,039
No, because they're fun.

133
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,107
They're a very fun group
of people, right? I mean...

134
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,143
- Yeah.
- Try to hate an Australian.

135
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,510
- It's impossible.
- A bunch of rapscallions.

136
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,811
- Little rascals.
- Ooh, but French, though.

137
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,647
- French.
- Ugh.

138
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,682
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Snobby. Snobby, yes.

139
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,118
Yes, yes.
You will definitely dislike him,

140
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,854
but you won't fear him because
he's most likely a pussy.

141
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,756
- Oh.
- Right. - That's right.

142
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,823
- Not scary. Not scary.
- Right, right.

143
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,292
When in doubt,

144
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,960
- go Eastern European, right?
- Right.

145
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,195
- That's a classically evil part of the world.
- Uh-huh.

146
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:46,863
- There you go.
- That'd work.

147
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,499
You know, let's talk a bit
about the female character.

148
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,401
- Nah.
- Do we have to?

149
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,636
- I would love to.
- The studio needs

150
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,871
a female perspective.

151
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,240
What did you think of Dr. Ling?

152
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,676
Oh, I think she sucks.
First of all, she comes in

153
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,146
with a whole plan,
like she's starting the movie.

154
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,684
So, you... you want the female
characters to have less agency?

155
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,387
Yeah. Look,
I feel bad enough about myself as is.

156
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,323
I don't need some super hot,
funny, smart chick doing, like,

157
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,226
roundhouse kicks and
cracking computer codes

158
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,195
- to make me feel worse.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

159
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:21,198
No. No. I-I like the women of
the old Thunder Gun days, right?

160
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,899
Bed 'em and dead 'em.

161
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,835
Look, first act, he meets a lady.

162
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,004
She's super hot, but I'm smarter, right?

163
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,107
And then he bangs her,
and she gets dead.

164
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,708
And-and later on, he meets someone.

165
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,776
All right, this one's smart,
I'll give her that,

166
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,345
but I'm funnier.

167
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:36,846
You know what I mean?

168
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,581
He bangs her, she gets dead, and then,

169
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,683
and in the end,
he falls in love with an ugly one,

170
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,085
and who cares about that?
I don't care about that.

171
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,753
And then she gets dead, and that sets up

172
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,054
for the next movie, and I'm all in.

173
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,424
Because all of the women are dead.

174
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,259
You know? No competition.

175
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,094
- Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.
- Yeah.

176
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:52,562
- Right?
- Okay, yeah. Write that down.

177
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,689
- Women hate women.
- I...

178
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,734
I think the studio
was trying to get away

179
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,137
from the female character just acting

180
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,705
as a plot device or a sex trophy.

181
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,607
- Ah, but, yeah, why?
- Why?

182
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,943
- But that works.
- Okay, let's move past this.

183
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:10,780
Let's take it into the second
act with this next clip.

184
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm sorry I dragged you into this,
ThunderGun.

185
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,253
Don't lose hope.

186
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,255
We may get out of this yet.

187
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:19,889
But if we don't,

188
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,791
I think there's something
I should tell you.

189
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,461
We've met before.

190
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,163
Detroit.

191
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,997
Winter.

192
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,732
At a bar.

193
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:31,734
I went home with you.

194
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:34,737
The next morning, you were gone,

195
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:37,374
and I never heard from you again.

196
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,911
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

197
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:44,914
I never was good at being tied down.

198
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:47,517
No, it's not that. It's just...

199
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:50,153
My assistant.

200
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:51,621
You know Max.

201
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:54,291
Well, he's not just my assistant.

202
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:56,326
He's my son.

203
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:01,030
- Are you trying to tell me...
- Yes, John.

204
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,799
He's your son, too.

205
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,702
Max is your son.

206
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:07,637
Okay.

207
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,839
So, this is the midpoint twist.

208
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:10,941
What is?

209
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,726
Um, ThunderGun finding out he has a son.

210
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,494
- Mm-hmm.
- He has a son?

211
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,729
Yes.

212
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,497
But how is this the twist?

213
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,499
I mean, because he's got a kid?

214
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,334
I mean, he's probably
got a thousand kids,

215
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,071
all the raw-dog loads he drops.

216
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,207
I don't know what "raw-dog loads" are.

217
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,209
Sorry for him. But my disgusting friend

218
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,710
does bring up a good point.

219
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,545
I mean, every Thunder Gun movie

220
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,783
has at least one very tasteful
yet very erotic sex scene in it,

221
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,450
- and this had none.
- Mm.

222
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,352
Yeah. I've... I've been waiting
for the right time

223
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,221
to bring this up,
but I feel like we need to address

224
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,890
the elephant in the room, no?

225
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,557
- Yeah, this is a big one for us.
- Might as well.

226
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,126
- I've been thinking about it.
- Might as well. - Yeah.

227
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,527
Okay, so...

228
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,862
where's the dong?

229
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,599
The-the dong?

230
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,533
- The dong.
- Yeah, yeah.

231
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,701
Yeah, the dong. The dong.

232
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,869
John ThunderGun has hung dong

233
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,938
in every chapter of this saga.

234
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,572
And, well,
I just watched 90 minutes of one,

235
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,241
and yet not one hang.

236
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,211
Well, I think
that the studio was thinking

237
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:08,715
the gratuitous nudity
was maybe a bit much.

238
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,717
- Fuck you.
-Bullshit!

239
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,420
- Bullshit!
- This is exactly the type of Hollywood bullshit

240
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,888
- that America is sick of.
- What are you talking about?

241
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,723
Hollywood's completely out of touch.

242
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,725
- So out of touch with what people want!
- Don't you want to give people

243
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,494
- what people actually want?
- There's a bigger issue here.

244
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,496
Movies are different now.

245
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,933
You lost a sense of community.

246
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,101
Interesting. Go on.

247
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,971
Look, years ago, before the Internet,

248
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,440
we would all go out to
the movies together.

249
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,975
Yes. This is exactly what studios

250
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,410
are trying to bring back. A-An event.

251
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,480
- A place we can all go to enjoy as a community.
- Yeah.

252
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,182
I mean, it used to be

253
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,185
you give the creep-show at
the window a couple of bucks,

254
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,787
you could spend all day
in there popping off.

255
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,290
And the joy of it was that
there were people popping off

256
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,524
at the same time.

257
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,792
I mean, n-not that you looked

258
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,527
at each other. It was dark.

259
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,429
You weren't looking for the gay thing.

260
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,222
But it gave you a sense of
something bigger than yourself.

261
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:02,002
Now, they... you know,

262
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,636
got rid of all these movie theaters.

263
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,805
They're taking all the
sex out of the movies.

264
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,507
And what am I supposed to do?

265
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,311
Go home, turn the lights off
and pop off in front of Charlie?

266
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,679
No, thanks.

267
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,048
I'm sorry.

268
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,885
Are you talking about
pornography theaters?

269
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,054
I'm talking about community, honey.

270
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,324
Right. E...
Uh, yeah, even if the studios

271
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,893
wanted to put back in the nudity,

272
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,028
they couldn't because of the new rating.

273
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,297
Wh-What do you mean, the new rating?

274
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,166
Thunder Gun: Maximum Cool
will be rated PG-13.

275
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,481
What?

276
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,506
Now, that's quite a midpoint twist.

277
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,807
They did it! They did.

278
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,143
They ruined everything
with this PC bullshit.

279
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,245
Straight white men can't
have anything anymore.

280
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,915
Men? Look, don't forget white women.

281
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,983
We got completely passed over.

282
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,885
Yeah, and I can't follow any of this.

283
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,353
We're feeling a lot of outrage
right now, you know,

284
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,687
because we want something,
and we know we deserve it,

285
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,855
- but we're not getting it.
- Mm.

286
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,726
I'm mad, but I don't know
at what anymore.

287
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,323
That's what it is!

288
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,662
That's what it is! I'm pissed!

289
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,830
- Aah! I'm mad.
- Listen, listen.

290
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,232
Our way of life is changing,

291
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,699
- and that's scary.
- Right.

292
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,936
- We don't want to change.
- Oh, that makes me so angry.

293
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,070
- Makes me mad.
- I want to cling

294
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,738
to the way things were,
but they're done.

295
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,206
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's run from this.

296
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,507
- We'll run from it.
- Wait, wait, wait,

297
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,542
- wait, wait.
- Do we have to, legally?

298
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,544
Guys, we can't run. Come on.

299
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,779
What's ThunderGun's slogan?

300
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,550
"No hesitation, no surrender,
no man left behind."

301
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,617
Did we leave a guy in there, though?

302
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,019
Goddamn right we did, Charlie,

303
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,422
and his name is John ThunderGun.

304
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:33,360
Like it or not,
we have a civic duty to uphold.

305
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,128
We owe it to ourselves, to ThunderGun,

306
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,896
and to movie audiences
all over the world

307
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,399
to put a stop to this liberal,
PC bullshit.

308
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,134
Mm-hmm.
- But I think we have been selected

309
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,870
for a cosmic reason here;
to put an end to this.

310
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,273
To not pull our punches.

311
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,475
To save the dong.

312
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,679
Save the dong.

313
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,406
- Save the dong.
- Save the dong.

314
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,888
- I agree.
- Oh, for God's sakes.

315
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,157
- This is why you don't include women.
- Are you kidding me?!

316
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,592
What?!

317
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,893
Don't you see that there was a rhythm?

318
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,495
- Like a cinematic rhythm.
- Oh, let's do it again.

319
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,397
- Let's do it again.
- No way. No way!

320
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,598
- I get it now.
- You-you can't...

321
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,203
You can't give women the zingers.

322
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:17,172
Now, you listen here,
you goddamn Hollywood communist.

323
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,307
I live in Roxborough.

324
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,209
Again, I didn't make this movie.

325
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,778
Listen to me, listen to me.
If you start to strip sex

326
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,646
out of our communities,
out of our culture

327
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,315
and-and even our art,

328
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:29,151
not only do you isolate people,
but you create an oppression

329
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:31,120
disguised as morality.

330
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,855
I mean, the... the Thunder Gun series

331
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,024
has always been groundbreaking
in so many ways,

332
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:37,893
notwithstanding the
recognition of an inequality

333
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:41,063
that was present in cinema
since its beginning days.

334
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:44,133
The objectifying
of the female form. I mean,

335
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,669
with Thunder Gun,
a great injustice was rectified. Okay?

336
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:49,071
Fairness of the sexes.

337
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:52,007
A unification of the human condition.

338
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,809
I'm sorry, is this still
about the flaccid penis

339
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:55,210
you'd like to see?

340
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:56,578
You're goddamn right!

341
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,247
- Yeah.
- We want to see it.

342
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,649
Yes, we want to see
the man's dick, but...

343
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,217
I guess what I'm saying
is that it's no longer

344
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:03,518
just about gratuitous boobs,

345
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,220
it's also about gratuitous penis.

346
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:08,557
I mean, ThunderGun was about progress.

347
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,094
Right. Uh, I think we all can agree

348
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,197
that public opinion has sort
of turned against the idea

349
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,166
of someone exposing themselves.

350
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,401
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

351
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:22,037
- This is a different thing.
- You're not understanding it.

352
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,774
See, ThunderGun didn't take his
dick out to intimidate people.

353
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:27,376
He did it because he had
accomplished his mission.

354
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:30,118
He wanted to kick back
and call it a day.

355
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:31,680
He did do it once to intimidate someone,

356
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:33,348
- but that was the bad guy.
- It was the bad guy.

357
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:35,584
And it just so happened
the bad guy was a female.

358
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,953
That was the best one.
That was the best one!

359
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:40,422
- That was funny.
- It made me wish I had a dong

360
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,425
that I could pull out to
celebrate my accomplishments.

361
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,695
You know? Or maybe
just feel the cool breeze

362
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:50,032
gently tickle the shaft on a,
on a crisp autumn morn.

363
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:53,076
I don't know, whatever men do to...
to feel powerful.

364
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,603
- That's what it is.
- It really is. It really is.

365
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,438
Listen, Moderator, the point is this.

366
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,207
I mean, it used to be only, like,

367
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,476
the hard-line conservatives,
like the pearl-clutching types,

368
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,612
were the only ones
that were overly vocal

369
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:06,315
and extreme in their
policing of sexuality.

370
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,984
But now you got this, like, liberal wave

371
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,320
of moral authority sweeping the nation.

372
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:12,955
You know, it's nuts.
I mean, think about it.

373
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:15,290
If the conservatives had
always run Hollywood,

374
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:17,226
movies would have sucked.

375
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,661
You know what I mean?
The art would have suffered.

376
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,096
So I guess the question we're asking is

377
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,732
how will art fare under
the oppressive thumb

378
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:27,602
of this new liberal
Hollywood moral PC elite?

379
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,604
Well, I don't know. It's tough to say.

380
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:32,241
But is that a world
that we want to live in?

381
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:34,944
I say no.

382
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,479
I say give me dong

383
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:39,148
or give me death.

384
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:40,582
Yeah!

385
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:41,783
Yeah, man, don't tell me

386
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,853
what I can see and what I can't see.

387
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:47,957
So, uh, just to be clear here,
they didn't make it PG-13

388
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,025
because of political correctness.

389
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,261
- Oh, did they not?
- No. No-no. They-they made it PG-13

390
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:53,428
because rated-R movies

391
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:56,165
aren't making as much money anymore.

392
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,168
Because of streaming,
and most importantly,

393
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,037
- piracy.
- Piracy, huh?

394
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:04,306
Yeah, and how have you all
been viewing the franchise?

395
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,308
- Oh, no-no, not through piracy.
- No.

396
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,978
In f... In fact, we,
we-we saw the last installment

397
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,645
of-of the franchise out in the theater.

398
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,547
- We barely made it.
- We barely made it.

399
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:13,715
Oh, wait, no-no, hold on,

400
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,784
but Frank called in that bomb threat.

401
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,186
Oh, but-but that was okay,
because remember,

402
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,321
then we went home, and we,
we saw it on the Internet.

403
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:20,822
- Caught it online.
- We caught it online.

404
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,657
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
On that website that has all the movies.

405
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,359
So, that's... that is pirating.

406
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:25,995
No, no, no, pirating is stealing.

407
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,696
We didn't steal it, okay?
We just downloaded it.

408
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,946
Uh, the website is called
"MoviePirate.com."

409
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,234
And the other one is called,

410
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,208
uh, "FreeMovies/Arrrgh."

411
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,739
Ah, I'm starting to see a
little bit of a pattern here,

412
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:41,310
because, uh, I also use one called
"StolenMovies.free."

413
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:44,379
So... you're part of the problem.

414
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:47,786
Because of people like you,
the studios felt like

415
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,610
this was their only recourse.

416
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,586
PG-13 opens up a whole new market.

417
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,389
You're saying it's our fault
that we don't get to see the dong?

418
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:55,590
You're coming in there
changing everything, you know,

419
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:56,926
getting rid of the dong, I mean,

420
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,393
how is that even Thunder Gun anymore?

421
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:01,216
Well, yeah, th-they're changing it.

422
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,232
They're rebooting the entire franchise.

423
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,733
- What?
- What d... What?

424
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,702
You guys didn't get that
from the final scene?

425
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:09,538
Uh, no, what...?

426
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,273
Okay. Let's review.

427
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,848
I'm not gonna make it through this one.

428
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:23,518
We can both go detonate
the hydro-fusion bomb.

429
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:26,655
No hesitation. No surrender.
No man left behind!

430
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,122
Not this time.

431
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:30,324
No, Dad.

432
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:32,326
Please.

433
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,664
Sometimes in order to save something...

434
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,510
you have to destroy something.

435
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,334
You'll need this
to get out of here, son.

436
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:47,609
To continue our story.

437
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:02,891
So, you see,
they're rebooting the franchise

438
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,392
for a younger audience.

439
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:05,760
The only people who are actually

440
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,195
still going to see movies.

441
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:09,564
I did not get that.

442
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:11,666
Well, you haven't gotten
anything the entire day.

443
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,167
Got to side with Charlie on this one.

444
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,904
I didn't get it.
Now, wh-what was with the fire stick?

445
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:17,538
You mean the torch?

446
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,874
The one he passed to his son Max...

447
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,010
as in Maximum Cool... and said,

448
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:23,778
"You need to continue our story"?

449
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,080
It's the camera guy who screwed up.

450
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,349
'Cause ThunderGun,
he fell into that fiery abyss,

451
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,518
- and for some reason, we're watching the kid...
- Yeah,

452
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,121
we wanted to go down into
the volcano with John...

453
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,289
No-no, you guys don't get it.
It's a cliffhanger. Yeah?

454
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:37,592
It's a cliffhanger. We're gonna
find out what happened to John

455
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:40,094
in the next movie, Thunder Gun 5...

456
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:42,363
- Ooh...
- Or, or there's a post-credit scene

457
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,199
- that we didn't get to see, yes?
- No. No. There's none of that.

458
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,201
This isn't a cliffhanger. He's dead.

459
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:51,773
John is dead.
Now we follow the son's story.

460
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,441
- No!
- I don't, I don't want to.

461
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:54,575
- I don't think so.
- No.

462
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,545
You don't have to think.
I'm telling you, that's what it is.

463
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,981
ThunderGun fell into a volcano.

464
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:04,318
He died. And now his son
Max becomes Thunder Son,

465
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:06,655
the face of the
franchise moving forward.

466
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:09,057
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

467
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,491
He has a son?

468
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,828
Fuck, man! What?

469
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:16,297
- How do you not get that?
- It wasn't clear.

470
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,900
Reshoots. Reshoots. You got to reshoot.

471
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,269
- Yeah, reshoots.
- Reshoots to make the movie more clear...

472
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:23,004
No! That's not what we're gonna do.

473
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,940
We're out of time. That's it.
That's... We're done.

474
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,910
But you're ruining
our favorite movie! Uh...

475
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:31,179
- How can we save the movies that we love?
- Yeah.

476
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,581
Maybe if you actually
go out to the theaters

477
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,250
and pay to see them,
then they will continue to make them.

478
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:40,288
Whoa! Oh, that's easy for you to say!

479
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,824
With your Hollywood
liberal bank account!

480
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:44,793
Jesus! Who are you people?!

481
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,564
I... am ThunderGun.

482
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:53,167
I... am ThunderGun.

483
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,437
I... am ThunderGun.

484
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,106
I am... Thundergun.

485
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,207
Goddammit, Dee!

486
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,175
- Dee...
- How did you not feel

487
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,711
- that I was next and then you?
- I don't know.

488
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:03,878
There was a build to it,

489
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,379
- and then...
- It's like, we're trying

490
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,882
to give the woman the final thing,
and she can't do it.

491
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,283
- Okay, start it over.
- You can't go back.

492
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,820
- Start it over?
- You see the problem with women.

493
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,891
Well, RIP ThunderGun, I guess.

494
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,326
Yeah. What a waste.

495
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,795
I recorded that whole thing for nothing.

496
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,763
Dong-less!

497
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,765
Wait a second.
You recorded the whole thing?

498
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,601
- Yeah.
- Guys... hang on a second.

499
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,637
Do you remember what ThunderGun said?

500
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,739
Sometimes, in order to save something,

501
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:31,775
you have to destroy something.

502
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,578
And I think I know what we
have to do to save Thunder Gun.

503
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,980
Destroy it?

504
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,448
Well, how are we gonna do that?

505
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:40,417
With a little help. From some pirates.

506
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:43,921
No hesitation.

507
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:45,256
No surrender.

508
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,192
No man left behind!

509
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,827

519
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:29,000
Mmm.

520
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,471
I'm bored.

521
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:35,706
Well, it looks like this
new Thunder Gun movie's

522
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:36,807
pretty good.

523
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:38,842
Well, you guys want to see it?

524
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,311
We're gonna have to do a mad
dash across town, though.

525
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:41,845
It starts in 30 minutes.

526
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:43,414
- To the sewers!
- To the sewers!

527
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,216
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

528
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,651
No, no, I meant like,
let's see it on that pirate website.

529
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:49,420
- You think it's up already?
- Here, let me check.

530
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:50,721
Yeah. We don't have to go across town.

531
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,489
- It's probably on the, uh...
- Yeah, it's free.

532
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:54,091
We can stay here and watch it.

533
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,559
- That way it's free.
- Yep. It-it's on there.

534
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,161
- Oh!
- Put it... Yeah.

535
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:58,595
You want to watch it on the phone?

536
00:20:58,629 --> 00:20:59,830
- Oh, good.
- All right.

537
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,665
Five tickets for the price of zero.

538
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:06,270
Put on the Auto Motion Plus.
