1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,868
<i>Hey, Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!</i>

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:05,769
<i>Do you want to take your feet</i>
<i>off my bed, please?</i>

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,204
<i> It's not your bed, okay?</i>
<i>It's my goddamn floor!</i>

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,006
And how many times do
I have to ask you guys

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,107
to please just pick up your shit

6
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,439
when you wake up in the morning!

7
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,761
You're turning this place
into the Superdome.

8
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,579
Superdome? That's, like,
six years too late.

9
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,014
That's a super lame reference.

10
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,265
And it's kind of offensive.

11
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,400
You'll be happy to know,
by the way,

12
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:20,718
we are looking
for a place right now.

13
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:22,019
All right? What about
this place, man?

14
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,787
Ah, it looks a little bit junky.

15
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,039
It kind of reminds me of here.

16
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:26,257
Yeah, this place
is a piece of shit.

17
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:27,758
It's not junky, okay?

18
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,326
You guys have destroyed
everything, and that's

19
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,595
why it looks junkier,
like a couple of locusts.

20
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,364
Oh, I take that as a compliment.

21
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,999
It's not a compliment.
Well, it's biblical,

22
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,150
so it's a compliment.
Yeah.

23
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:37,234
Why is everything

24
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,202
so goddamn expensive?
I mean,

25
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,603
I wish we hadn't burned down

26
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,105
our rent-controlled apartment.

27
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:42,139
Yeah, you think?

28
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,341
Dee, I will slap you
in the teeth.

29
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,609
You think this is easy?

30
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,860
We-we have a list
of demands here.

31
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,012
We need two bedrooms.

32
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,580
We-we need two bathrooms,
minimum.

33
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,981
You know what? Whatever.
What's your plan?

34
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,783
Where are you guys gonna
find a place that fits

35
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,732
all of your needs for
under 1,500 bucks a month?

36
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:16,307

00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:19,986
<i>Well, guys,</i>

38
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,187
this is it.

39
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,489
Welcome to our
beautiful new home.

40
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:25,024
This is crazy.
You guys should've just

41
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,859
moved into that empty apartment
in our building.

42
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,744
The one where the family
was murdered?

43
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,862
Brutally murdered.

44
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,781
Pass.
This place is awesome.

45
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,200
You guys are gonna thrive out
here, and I am not gonna have

46
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:35,701
to worry about you
hogging my shower anymore.

47
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:37,169
And we don't have to worry
about getting ringworm.

48
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:38,205
You brought the ringworm.

49
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:39,372
Yeah, and now your apartment

50
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,873
is infested with it.
Yeah.

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,174
Don't worry, you'll
be back to giving

52
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,426
each other worms soon enough.

53
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:44,710
These are city scum.

54
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,545
They can't hack it out here.

55
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:47,580
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

56
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,148
You want to bet?
Absolutely.

57
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,250
Okay, Frank.
So if Mac and I

58
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,652
can live here for a month,

59
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,654
then you have to pay
our rent for an entire year.

60
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,956
Deal. And if you don't,

61
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,809
you have to sleep in bed
with an old man for a year.

62
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:01,193
Gross!
What?

63
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,346
Yeah.

64
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:04,463
What are you laughing
about, Charlie?

65
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:05,853
You already sleep
with an old man,

66
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:07,300
and for no reason other than
you seem to enjoy it.

67
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,586
Yeah.

68
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,804
Okay, you know what, Frank?

69
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:13,806
You got a bet.

70
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,643
Won't last a month--
Frank is insane!

71
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,945
This place is paradise, man.

72
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:21,398
We can really
stretch out, you know?

73
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,848
It-it's quiet,
it's calm.

74
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,850
It's not like the city
where everything is so

75
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,218
stressful, you know?

76
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:27,570
I'm-I'm just...
I feel at ease.

77
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,839
When was the last time
that we had a home-cooked meal?

78
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:30,790
Oh, dude...

79
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:31,691
it's been forever.

80
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,676
Well, my friend, dig in.

81
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:35,144
Mmm.

82
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,346
Oh, my God.

83
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:39,999
Mac...

84
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,767
this is incredible.

85
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:43,436
You like it?
Oh, my God.

86
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,604
Oh, that is such a relief
because I worked so hard on it.

87
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,872
Yeah.

88
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,008
I call it Mac's
famous mac and cheese.

89
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:51,877
Okay, well, I don't know how...

90
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:53,746
I don't really know
how famous it is.

91
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:55,848
I mean, I'm your roommate,
and I've never heard of it.

92
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,284
So, what do you want
to do after dinner?

93
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:00,419
Uh... well, see, the
TV's not hooked up,

94
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,288
so can't watch TV.

95
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:04,890
Um, there's not really any
bars around here, so...

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,025
Right.

97
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:07,126
You know what we should do?

98
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:08,594
Hmm?

99
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:09,945
Let's just get a
good night's sleep.

100
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,063
That's a good idea.
Yeah.

101
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:11,964
Yeah.

102
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,399
What was that?

103
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,000
What was what?

104
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,536
You hear that,
that chirping sound?

105
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,772
I did not, no.

106
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,874
Probably a smoke detector
or something like that, huh?

107
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:23,392
Right, yeah.
No big deal.

108
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:26,078
Hey, to a great night's sleep.

109
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
Good morning.
Mm.

110
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:48,934
Hey, man, did you hear that...?

111
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,219
The pool filter?

112
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,188
Oh, my God.
It was like a jet engine.

113
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,673
I didn't get any sleep
at all last night, you know?

114
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,392
One noise is so much louder

115
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,210
than all the city noises
combined, you know?

116
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,545
You just, you fixate.
Totally.

117
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,141
I get that, but I-I
was actually talking

118
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,882
about that chirping sound--
did you hear that?

119
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,350
It was, like,
happening all night.

120
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:05,551
No, I didn't hear that.

121
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,319
Oh, man, it was driving me nuts.

122
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,871
Yeah.
Anyway, want to roll?

123
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,890
I, uh, got us some music.
I made this Creed mix.

124
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,742
Oh, uh, Creed, huh?

125
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:13,976
Yeah, it's a long commute, so...

126
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,194
Yeah, I was thinking more,

127
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:17,163
like, Bryan Adams.
Okay.

128
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,814
But it-it is Tuesday.
Yeah...

129
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,332
Which is technically my music day.
Right, it's...

130
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,184
Yeah, and that was cool and all
when it only took us,

131
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,869
like, ten minutes to get to
work, but now we're looking

132
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:25,185
at, like, an hour or so commute.

133
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,539
I'm thinking
maybe more my thing.

134
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:28,140
But hey, you know what?
Here's an idea.

135
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,975
Why don't you take
a personal day?

136
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:31,610
You know, I mean, we got
a lot of property here.

137
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:34,046
It might be nice to have
someone here to look after it.

138
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,548
Yeah.
You know, maybe get that TV working.

139
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:37,450
Maybe take a run at that,
uh, pool filter?

140
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:38,918
- Oh. Huh?
- Hey!

141
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:39,985
You must be the new neighbors.

142
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,120
Name's Wally Schmidt.

143
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:42,888
No relation to Mike.

144
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,623
But don't tell my wife.

145
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,962
Boy, it sure is a
hot one today, huh?

146
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,067
Okay.

147
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,253
Nice to meet you boys.

148
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,974
What the hell was
that all about?

149
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:03,666
He just comes up
and starts talking to us?

150
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,611
Right, some guy comes up to me,
I don't know what he's...

151
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:07,413
I don't know what he's up to.
No. It's like the whole time,

152
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:09,098
I'm staring at him, I'm
thinking, does he have a knife?

153
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,566
Are we gonna have to take
this bitch out right now?

154
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:11,650
No. I don't know.
I don't know.

155
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,118
But it's-it's the city, though.

156
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,637
It-it's forced me to develop
these sharp edges.

157
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,355
For protection, you know?
I got to smooth them out.

158
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,390
We're in the suburbs.
Let's work on it a little bit.

159
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,526
Okay, all right.
Shall we? You know, 'cause now I'm all tense.

160
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,761
I don't want to bring
this energy into work, you know?

161
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,564
Luckily, I got
the commute to relax.

Any-any good stories?

172
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,947
Charlie and Frank are doing
something with Russian hats now.

173
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,899
Really? What?
I don't know.

174
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,301
I couldn't follow any of it.
What did you do today?

175
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:55,786
Did you, uh, fix
that pool filter?

176
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,521
Uh... I tried.

177
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,423
But it turns out it's
actually really complicated,

178
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,525
and I didn't go to school
for that, you know?

179
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,554
Mostly I just tried to get
the living room set up.

180
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,933
It took a little while
to find a stud.

Yeah, I can, I can see that.

182
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,787
Maybe, uh, take another
personal day tomorrow, huh?

183
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,039
You know, maybe I will take
another run at that pool filter.

184
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,341
Maybe try and do
all the other things

185

do today, but, uh,

00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,356
Oh, uh...

222
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,557
Sure.

223
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:41,909
Excuse us for a second.

00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,163
Hey. What?

227
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,931
Come on, man.
You gonna invite some guy

228
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,499
over to my house
that I don't even know.

229
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,385
I just wanted to have, uh,
somebody over for dinner.

230
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,270
So I got to have dinner
with some guy, "Hey, pool guy."

231
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,721
His name is Jimmy!

232
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,323
Jimmy? I don't give
a fuck what you do.

233
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,225
You could ask him about
all sorts of things. I mean...

234
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,843
What do you want me
to ask pool guy?

235
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,361
If he knew shit
that I was interested in,

236
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,768
he wouldn't be
a fucking pool guy.

237
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,551
I said I'm sorry.

238
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,654
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm
just, uh...

239
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,023
I'm just confused,
you know, I...

240
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,842
Here I am thinking that we
got a pool that's outside.

241
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,478
Eh... I didn't realize
that we had an indoor pool.

242
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,405
Can we just forget about it
and eat our dinner?

243
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:21,815
It's just so funny.

244
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,201
We got enough money
for two pools.

245
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,503
And yet we don't have enough
money for a recipe book,

246
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,439
'cause here we are eating
mac and cheese again.

247
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,774
You don't know how hard it is

248
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,676
to be cooped up in here
all by myself, okay?

249
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,462
At least you get to go to work.

250
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:36,847
I "get to go to work"?
Yes.

251
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:39,116
Oh, everybody, hey,
I get to go to work.

252
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,917
I "get" to have a job.

253
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,620
I "get" to have to
make money for us.

254
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,589
Oh, my... You know
what, screw this.

255
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,090
Wh... Oh, oh, yes.

256
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,191
Fine, just walk away
right in the middle...

257
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,092
Dennis.

258
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,119
Goddamn it.

259
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,253
What is that?

260
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,688
Aah.

261
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,006
Son of a bitch.

262
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:03,924
What...?

263
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:04,891
Son of a bitch.

264
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:05,876
The hell you doing?

265
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:06,904
Oh, do you hear it, too?

266
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,261
I heard you bashing.

267
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,579
Yeah, yeah, that chirping?

268
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,048
I'm pretty sure it's a cricket.

269
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,983
Okay, you know what, I'm
gonna say something here,

270
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,185
and it might not
be popular, but...

271
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,687
I hate this place.

272
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,076
And I got to get
back to the city.

273
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,306
I'm going nuts.

274
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,024
I miss the city, too.
I miss the action.

275
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,926
You know, I thought this
place would soften my edges,

276
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,194
but they're sharper than ever.

277
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,129
Dude, I cannot
be cooped up here.

278
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,148
You know, cooking
and cleaning and fixing.

279
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,933
All right, all right,
calm down, calm down.

280
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,685
I... I think I
have an idea.

281
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,403
L-Let's... let's
invite the gang over.

282
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:34,938
You know, we'll
clean up the place,

283
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,606
we'll serve 'em a nice dinner,

284
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,219
we'll show 'em how-how
well we're doing,

285
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,343
and I'll feel Frank out
about this bet, you know,

286
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,979
which in retrospect is
completely ridiculous.

287
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,481
How are they gonna
find an old man

288
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,849
that's gonna go along with this?

289
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:46,950
Right. Exactly.

290
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,388
Mac and Dennis, old man.

291
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,007
Old man, Mac and Dennis.

292
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,444
Ah...

293
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,643
So, uh, what's with the hats?

294
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,794
I... You wouldn't
get it. Uh-uh.

295
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,946
Yeah, you kind of had
to be there, man.

296
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,498
Hey, how about that food, huh?

297
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,900
Mac calls it "Mac's
famous mac and cheese."

298
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,318
And it is famous.

299
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,837
In my stomach.

300
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,488
We're your friends,
and I've never heard of it.

301
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,373
Hey, guys.

302
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,003
We are having so much fun
at this house.

303
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,261
I'll tell you, I can't believe
we ever lived anywhere else.

304
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,747
But I was just curious,
if we were to lose this bet,

305
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:27,650
what would the logistics be,
like, with the old man thing?

306
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,968
Oh.

307
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,620
Well, I'll tell
you what I'll do.

308
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,705
If you guys are cracking,
you can forfeit now,

309
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,076
I'll buy the three of youse
a California king-size bed

310
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,861
- to sleep in.
- What?!

311
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,889
No, they're not gonna forfeit--
this place is rad.

312
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,598
You want a little side action?

313
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,665
No, no, no, don't muddy
this with side action.

314
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:43,767
Dee, don't do it.

315
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:44,634
I'll take some side action.

316
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:45,635
No...

317
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:46,770
Tell you what.

318
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:48,354
How about if they win,

319
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,490
I'll take that California
king bed for myself.

320
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,375
Fine, and if they lose,

321
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,268
the three of you got to
sleep with the old man.

322
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:56,579
Fine.

323
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:57,413
Deal.
Goddamn it.

324
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:58,598
Excuse me.

325
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,283
I have to piss.

326
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,253
Out of my penis.

327
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,523
Right.

328
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:15,498
Okay, well, clearly Mac wants
to speak to me in secret.

329
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,433
Uh, so excuse me.

330
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,303
Wha...?

331
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,405
Oh, good, you got my signal.
Yeah, got your signal.

332
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,090
Dude, we're not gonna make it,
we're not gonna make it.

333
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,341
Yeah, dude, it's cool, man.

334
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,259
W-We'll figure
it out. It's...

335
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:27,777
No, no, it's not cool.

336
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,112
There's no way
we're gonna make it.

337
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,513
And also, dude,
what's with the hats?

338
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,015
What is with those hats?!
Dennis, I got to know.

339
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,349
They told me the story,
and it didn't make sense,

340
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,717
and now we can't
get it out of them.

341
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:36,486
Look, dude, I don't
want to sound racist,

342
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,788
but can we just discuss the fact
that it's an old black man?

343
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,690
Yeah, mmm.
It was supposed to be an old man.

344
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,559
Just an old man.
Now it's a black man.

345
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:44,210
Dude, that's, like, a whole
other thing. That's two things.

346
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,845
That's two things,
it's two things.

347
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:46,896
All right,
you know what, let's...

348
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,531
Maybe we just...
we-we just...

349
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,266
we take the California king.
I mean, that's a big bed.

350
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,215
You want to share the bed
with an old black man?

351
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,369
No, of course not, I...

352
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,721
All right, that sounded racist.

353
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:56,306
I don't want to share
a bed with an old man.

354
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:57,631
I'm just saying it's a big bed,

355
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,708
and we could probably
work it out.

356
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:01,077
Okay, so picture
big bed, big bed.

357
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:02,512
Me on the side,
you know, you right here.

358
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,180
Old man, right here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

359
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,115
Why am I in the middle? Black
man should be in the middle.

360
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,483
Don't call him "black man."

361
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,052
His name's not "black man."
His name's "old man."

362
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,303
Let's stick with "old man."
Okay.

363
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:11,421
Just sounds better.

364
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,740
All right, so how about this?

365
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:16,943
You and I on the big bed,
side-by-side, black man, he's...

366
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,461
Now you got me doing it.
Mmm.

367
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,613
Old man is down at the bottom,
sideways, like a dog.

368
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,715
Are you calling
black people dogs?

369
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,934
No, that's not what I...
That's very racist.

370
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,753
What the hell is going...?

371
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,805
Oh, my God.

372
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,740
You guys are cracking, aren't you?

373
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:33,309
Nah, it's-it's, like... fine. Nah, it's fine.
What?!

374
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,311
- It's soul-crushing, Dee. - Oh, my God,
I can't make this house into a home.

375
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:36,597
I didn't go to school for that.

376
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:37,981
He didn't go to school for it.
No.

377
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,782
Well, why did you let me
take the side action?!

378
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:41,668
I told you not to take the side action!
You bitch. You bitch.

379
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,853
Why didn't you yell it so I could hear it?
I'm tired of yelling.

380
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,922
Damn it. Now we got to figure
out where Dee goes in the bed.

381
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:48,358
Oh, right, Dee's got to be in the bed.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

382
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:49,792
I'll tell you exactly
where Dee goes, okay?

383
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:51,261
Dee goes right
in the goddamn middle

384
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:52,897
of her brand-new
California king-size bed

385
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,964
all by herself.

386
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,966
How are we even having
this conversation?!

387
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,334
All you boys have to do...

388
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,838
Guys, all you got to do
to win is just exist.

389
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,893
Hey, morning, buddy.

390
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,494
You're up early.

391
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,246
Yeah, I'm up early,
and I'm feeling great.

392
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:12,181
You know, I was thinking
about it, and Dee was right.

393
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,050
All we have to do is exist here
for the next couple weeks,

394
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,385
and we win this bet.

395
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:16,436
So... check
this out.

396
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,755
I made you that.

397
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:20,556
"Mac's Honey Do List"?
Yep.

398
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,959
That is a list of chores to
give you a sense of purpose,

399
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,794
so you don't feel so
cooped up and lonely.

400
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,963
How's a list of chores going
to make me feel less lonely?

401
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,265
Well, check out
chore number one.

402
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,234
"Name the dog."

403
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,969
Well, that's so stupid.
I don't have a dog.

404
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:35,021
You sure about that?

405
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,572
Yeah, positive.
I don't have a dog.

406
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:37,890
I mean, I had Poppins,
but he's gone.

407
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,325
Are you sure?
I don't have a dog.

408
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,077
What do you mean, am I sure?
Of course I'm sure.

409
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,026
I wouldn't be so sure.

410
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,513
What are you doing?
Why...

411
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:44,697
What... are you okay?
Look behind you, asshole.

412
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,833
Oh.

413
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,685
You got me a dog?
Yeah.

414
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,154
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

415
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:52,538
I mean, he's no Poppins, but...

416
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,490
Yeah, he's a lot better
than Poppins, trust me.

417
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,059
Oh, Dennis, Dennis.

418
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,443
I'm gonna name him Dennis.

419
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:58,962
Huh?

420
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:00,930
You're Dennis.
He's Dennis Jr.

421
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:02,432
Weird.

422
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Um, but sure, yeah, that's fine.

423
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:05,769
Hey, so why don't you go ahead

424
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,003
and cross number one
off the list there?

425
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,538
See how it feels.
Okay, yeah.

426
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,024
Hey, what's a-a couple weeks
between two best friends, right?

427
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,375
It's whatever we make of it.

428
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:14,110
So why don't we agree right now

429
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,512
to make these next few weeks
the best of our lives?

430
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,513
You with me, buddy?

431
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:19,082
I'm with you.

432
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,250
I'm gonna raise this guy
like he was our own son.

433
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,402
Okay.

434
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,670

Haven't seen you for a bit.

461
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:33,272
You've probably
been staying inside

462
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:35,091
to avoid this, uh,
heat wave, huh?

463

Boy, it's been hot.

464

It's hot, huh?

465
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,731
Yeah.

466
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:43,199
It is super hot.

467
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,068
Yeah.

468
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,986
It's getting real hot
around here.

469
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,006
So hot, Wally.

470
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:52,875
But you don't really know
what hot is, do you?

471
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,811
Hot's a storm.

472
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,146
You ever been in a storm, Wally?

473
00:15:57,215 --> 00:16:00,516
I mean, a real storm?

474
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,187
Not a thunderstorm,
but a storm of fists

475
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,556
raining down on your head.

476
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,791
Blasting you in the face.

477
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,094
Pummeling you in the stomach.

478
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:14,030
Hitting you in the chest so hard

479
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,765
you think
your heart's gonna stop.

480
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,451
You ever been in a storm
like that, Wally?

481
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,866
Dennis.

482
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:25,983
Dennis.

483
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,979
You okay, dude?

484
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:33,474
Yeah.

485
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,877
Who you talking to?

486
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:43,017
No one.

487
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,552
What's that?

488
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,637
Dog grave.

489
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:48,856
Oh.

490
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,027
Anything exciting
happen at work today?

491
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,830
Uh-uh.

492
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,331
Well, I called up there.

493
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,133
They... they said
you weren't even there.

494
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,236
Can we not talk about my day?

495
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,504
Sure.

496
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,306
Perhaps we can talk
about my day.

497
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,125
And how was your day?

498
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,593
Not great.

499
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,645
You know, with the dog dying
and all, but...

500
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,747
somehow, old Mac
pulled it together.

501
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,082
He cooked for you,
and he cleaned for you.

502
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,552
In fact, Dennis,
everything I do,

503
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,120
I do for you.

504
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,640
What are you talking about, man?

505
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,193
I'm talking about
everything I do, I do for you!

506
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,427
And everything you do,

507
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,663
you do for yourself!

508
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,364
Sleeping in your car.

509
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,916
Eating at Applebee's.

510
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,901
Were you spying on me?

511
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,520
Oh, don't you turn this
around on me.

512
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:36,804
All you do is think
about yourself!

513
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,339
You didn't even notice

514
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:39,854
that I switched up
the mac and cheese.

515
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,376
Is that what this is about?

516
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:45,563
The goddamn mac and cheese?

517
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,515
Well, yeah, I noticed!

518
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,217
You put meat hunks in it!

519
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,285
Wow! Hunks of meat!

520
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,887
Mmm!
Well, of course Dennis

521
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,856
would like Dennis.
What?

522
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,674
It's Dennis!

523
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,758
What are you talking about?

524
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,360
You're eating the dog!

525
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,901
Oh! Oh!

526
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,353
Oh, God! What is
wrong with you?

527
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,739
I don't know! I guess it was
just a cry for attention.

528
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,307
You didn't even blink twice

529
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,009
when I told you
that the dog was dead.

530
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,245
I can't live with you anymore
in this goddamn place.

531
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,579
I'm out of here.

532
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:19,881
I'm gonna go stay in a hotel.

533
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,949
Where's my suitcase, Mac?

534
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,885
Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

535
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,554
Dennis, Dennis,
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis...

536
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,178
Tell me about Mac's
famous mac and cheese.

537
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:36,063
Okay, I can explain.

538
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,766
I called it my famous
mac and cheese as-as a joke.

539
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:40,351
But then it seemed
like you like it.

540
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,770
You like that it was
Mac's famous mac and cheese.

541
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,889
And so I just kept saying it.
You're pathetic.

542
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,407
You're the one
that's sitting at Applebee's

543
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:47,508
eating pot stickers
all by yourself.

544
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:48,817
You're the one that's pathetic.

545
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,647
Oh.

546
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,400
Well, that must be nosy Wally.

547
00:18:56,486 --> 00:19:00,154
Coming to see what all
the fighting's about.

548
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:04,158
Well... why don't we show him
what all the fighting's about?

549
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,077
Why don't we show him right now?
Wait, wait, wait!

550
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,862
Dennis, Dennis, calm down.

551
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,397
Don't you tell me to calm down.

552
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,133
There's that chirping again.

553
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,234
How are you not hearing that?

554
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,970
News flash, asshole!

555
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,673
I've been hearing it
the entire goddamn time!

556
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,758
Then why wouldn't
you say something?!

557
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,560
Because I hate you!

558
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,745
Oh, my God.

559
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,051
You did it!
Look at this!

560
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,053
Huh? We did what?
You got this, man.

561
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,421
Hey, in less than a minute,
Almost there.

562
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,639
you guys will have
been here a month.

563
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,890
Yep.
We almost...

564
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,308
we almost won the bet?
Yeah.

565
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,893
We almost did it!
W-W-We almost won the bet?

566
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,094
We're gonna do it!
We're gonna win the bet!

567
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,595
We're gonna win the bet!
Yeah!

568
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,763
Here it is, paid in full:

569
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,565
one year's rent.

570
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,983
Free rent for a year!

571
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,185
We did it! We did it!
Free rent for...

572
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,071
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

573
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,689
Free rent for where?

574
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,241
For right here.

575
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,526
Here we go.

576
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,862
In five, four,

577
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,197
three, two, one.

578
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,587
Hey, guys.

579
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,256
Is he dead?

580
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,092
Yeah, I think so.

581
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,863
Quiet your ass down.

582
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,799
Sorry, black man.

583
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,301
Old man.

584
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,803
Old man.
Sorry, old black man.

585
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,812
God damn it.

586
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:28,565
