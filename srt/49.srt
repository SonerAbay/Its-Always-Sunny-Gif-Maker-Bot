Yeah. Aren't we gonna be
at the barbecue soon?

00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,433
Yeah. I'm pregaming, man. What's going on with you?
You're going off the deep end lately.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,311
I feel like he's been wading around
in the deep end for a while.

8
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,439
No, bro, it's different.
He's staying out all hours of the night.

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,567
I never see him. If he is around,
he's usually not even wearing clothes.

[Mac, Dennis Laughing]
I'm wearing clothes now, bitch.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,489
You're wearing a shirt that's on
inside out and it's covered in grease.

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,700
Yeah, you're really greasy.
It's not grease. It's sap.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,869
- Sap? How did you get covered in sap?
- I got really wasted.

14
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,580
- I must've climbed a tree.
- You're really stepping up the insanity, huh?

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,999
I'm trying to push myself.
I want to see how far I could go.

16
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,460
I feel like you've been standing on
the edge of a cliff for a while now.

I say hop off.
Let's see where you land.

I really wish you wouldn't encourage him, man.
I really wish you wouldn't.

If somebody wants to push his boundaries,
you gotta let him. Frank, jump.

I thought we were going
to a barbecue, Frank.

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,069
It's more of a party in the park.
We're at a cemetery.

The party is in the cemetery.

What are we doing here, Frank? What's your angle?
I wanna bang your Aunt Donna.

We'd throw her in the dryer.

salt on her 'cause she was the snail.

Mm-hmm. Get it? Get it?
You throw salt on a snail, and...

It shrivels her up.
It's supposed to shrivel up.

Okay. Hear me out.

to help Frank.

Ah, we're caring people.
That's our nature.

Ooh. Ah, he is trying to bang our aunt.
That's the big one.

Uh, these things deal more with drug
and alcohol abuse. [Dee] Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,074
Drugs and alcohol are rolled into
what we're talking about here...

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,118
Oh, yeah.
With the aunt thing.

111
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,703
So he does have
a drinking problem.

112
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,496
Oh, big time. Big time.
Oh, lady.

113
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,540
But if I'm being honest,
my problem's less with the fact...

114
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,417
that he's drinking and more
that he's doing it without me.

115
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,838
And then I start thinking, "What's wrong with me?
Am I not fun to drink with?"

116
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,050
Oh, no. Don't do that to yourself.
You're plenty of fun to drink with.

Trust me, Charlie.
You get really, really drunk. Oh, yeah.

118
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,387
And then you get reckless,
and it's a lot of fun.

119
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,847
So how do we go
about doing this?

120
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,058
Do we ambush him
and then sort of like berate him...

121
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,393
into becoming the guy
we wanna be around?

122
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,437
You certainly don't berate him.

123
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,815
He needs to know you're coming
from a place of love and concern.

124
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,567
Mm-mmm. Too soft.

125
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,030
I think we should come at him with
an iron fist and crush him into submission.

126
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,365
Right, right.
If we're taking that approach,

127
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,035
you might wanna be armed at
this intervention. Mm-hmm.

128
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,120
Why- Why would
I need to be armed?

129
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,372
Well, Frank's usually carrying
a little gun with him.

130
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,750
- And he doesn't really hesitate to use it.
- [Dennis] And you know what?

131
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,752
Have the gun out and ready to rock
when he comes in.

132
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,881
- We'll all have guns. - It's just safer.
She could put it in her pants.

133
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,008
If we maybe ambush Frank
with a net...

134
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,260
or some kind of rope device,

135
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,430
the gun will maybe drop out of his waist belt.
You wanna bring him in in a net?

136
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,724
- [Dennis] That could get awkward.
- Just bring the gun.

137
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,477
Bring a gun. I don't wanna get shot,
so just bring a gun, will you?

138
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,358
You know,
I do offer group therapy.

139
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,528
Yeah.
What are you doing?

140
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,613
What is this you're doing?
What is that? What is that?

141
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:32,201
With all due respect, you're talking
about bringing guns to an intervention,

142
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,954
and you're drinking wine
out of a soda can.

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,206
Yeah.
You put wine in the soda can?

144
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,125
You didn't know, did you?
That's good.

145
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,376
Soda.
You stole Frank's idea.

146
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,086
Actually, it's a pretty good one.

00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,359
[All] Yeah, yeah, yeah!

292
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,487
Well, we realize we also just need
as many people attacking this guy...

293
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,988
as we can possibly get.
Mm-hmm.

294
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,699
Well, not attacking.
This is why I'm glad you called me back.

295
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,077
Yeah, okay, listen.
Before we get into that,

296
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,330
could you help us pop a quick intervention
on Charlie for his illiteracy?

297
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,374
The kid can't read or write.
Not a bit.

298
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,252
- [Laughing] - No joke.
It's no joke.

299
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:42,172
They've been riding me all day. I can read and write.
I just don't like to read and write.

300
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,299
Let's try and stay focused on Frank.

301
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,385
That's a good point.
He's gonna be here any second.

302
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,428
We told him there was
a giant grease fire...

303
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,140
- and he had to come down immediately.
- [Charlie, Dennis Chuckling]

304
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,602
Uh-oh. She's- I'm assuming you wouldn't
have lured him down with a fire.

305
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,604
Is that what your face
is doing right now?

306
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,233
Yeah. Um, and I wouldn't
have an intervention at a bar either.

307
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,652
[Laughing] Well, lady, look,

308
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,863
all mistakes we've made on our own,
so it's good that you're here.

309
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,323
We're doing our best.
We're doing our best.

310
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,783
Where's the goddamn fire?
[Gun Cocks]

311
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,287
Intervention! Intervention!
Ah, intervention!

312
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,540
Intervention! I got it! I got it!
You're surrounded, Frank!

313
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,585
There's nowhere for you to go.
You're trapped. You're trapped.

314
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,712
[All Chanting] You're trapped!
You're trapped!

315
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,547
Got you! Got you!
You're trapped!

316
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,550
- That's enough! That's enough!
- We told you there was gonna be a gun.

317
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,844
What the hell's going on?
Got you, man!

318
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,680
Sit down! You sit down so we can tell
you what an asshole you've been.

319
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,890
We're gonna get all in your
face and point out your faults.

320
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,227
A roast? I've always
wanted to be roasted.

321
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,314
Oh, wait. Let me just
switch gears here...

322
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,316
fire up this spliff.

323
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,401
No, no, no, no.
Wait. Frank, hold on.

324
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,989
Um, everyone's here today because they care
about you and they want you to get well.

325
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,950
She ain't funny. Next.

326
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,952
Frank, you're an asshole.
Ah! That's it.

327
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,496
- Now rain down on me.
Come on. - You're a prick!

328
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,957
And your addiction has affected
us in the following ways.

329
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,959
You are annoying!

330
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,004
Dennis, come on!
Give it to me with both barrels!

331
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,426
Why do we never play Night Crawlers anymore, huh?
I don't know, Charlie.

332
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,138
What is Night Crawlers? It's a game where
they crawl around in the night like worms.

333
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,974
I never said that.
Yeah, well, that's what it is.

334
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,685
Intervention! Intervention!
Is nothing private, Frank?

335
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,648
Jesus! Look, I like that game.
I don't wanna stop playing it.

336
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,775
Well, Charlie,
we can play that game.

337
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,942
You promise?
Yeah.

338
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,736
Whoo! Ahh!
Yeah.

339
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,738
Stop touching me.
[Speaks, Indistinct]

340
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,074
- [Mac] Just stop.
- [Dee] Whoa! What's this?

341
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,825
Me and Mac are together.

342
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,077
No! No!
No!

343
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,496
Intervention! Intervention!
Intervention!

344
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,498
What are you
interventioning me for?

345
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,208
Because you can't
be banging Gail the Snail.

346
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,794
I'm not banging Gail the Snail.
She followed me home.

347
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,296
[Slurps] Oh!
She was doing that the whole time.

348
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,841
[Dee] Yeah, she does that.
Swallow it or spit it out.

349
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,259
No, don't!
Oh, my God.

350
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,678
See?
Intervention!

351
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,638
Hey, babe, I'll get you
a drink from the bar.

352
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,223
Great. My God.
What are you doing, Mac?

353
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,975
I was just going over to her
house to try and bang Donna...

354
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,144
because she reminds me
so much of your mom,

355
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,521
which is
the best sex I ever had.

356
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,815
- [Groans] - Intervention.
Intervention.

357
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,734
[Mac] Huh?
You banged my dead wife?

358
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,654
Well, she was alive
at the time.

359
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,949
- But- Did you not know that?
- No.

360
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,327
It's cool, man. It's cool.
Intervention. Intervention. Okay?

361
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:21,373
Look, he's got a weird fetish for older
women, so don't hold it against him.

362
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,750
I don't have
an older-woman fetish.

363
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,293
Yeah, you do.
I don't wanna bang this chick.

364
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,129
Let's cool it with the
intervention stuff for a second...

365
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,214
'cause there's a lot of 'em
being thrown around right now,

366
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,882
and I'm having a little bit
of trouble keeping track.

367
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,260
The most important intervention is the
one we need to do on Gail the Snail...

368
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,553
and getting her
out of our lives.

369
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,305
Guys, let's do shots
and get crazy.

370
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,100
No, Gail. No. We're intervening on you, Snail.
Go. Get out of here.

371
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,269
Yeah, right.
How is she not getting this?

372
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,522
She's stonewalling us.
It is a classic Snail technique. Classic.

373
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,983
Ya! Get out of here, Snail!
[Dennis] He's got the salt!

374
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,068
Salt the Snail!
Ya, ya, ya!

375
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,904
Go, Snail!
Ya, ya, ya!

376
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,282
Ya! Ya!
Hey, guys! Guys, guys!

377
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,076
I was gonna invite you guys
all to a rave to hang out,

378
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,036
but now I don't wanna
hang out with you anymore.

379
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,122
Oh, my God. Salt the Snail.
Just salt her.

380
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,665
Wait, wait!
Do you guys wanna go?

381
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,667
No, no! We don't wanna go!
Wait!

382
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,377
I have glow sticks.

383
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,504
Salt the Snail!
[All Shouting]

384
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,922
[Dee] The whole thing!

385
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,509
- Ya, ya, ya!
- What is with that broad?

386
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,554
She is the worst, right?
That's what we've been saying.

387
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,140
Oh, my God. That was a terrible
experience for me by the way.

388
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,101
Of course it was. Nobody likes salting
the Snail, but she gives you no choice.

389
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,104
- She doesn't leave you with any options.
- What a horrible thing.

390
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm all worked up now.
I feel bad.

391
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,151
I feel like maybe I should have
some more wine in a can.

392
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,737
I'll get you one. I can use some
canned wine to calm down a little bit.

393
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,905
Oh, you guys are drinking
wine out of those cans?

394
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:35,947
Oh, you guys are drinking
wine out of those cans?

395
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,908
Hell, yeah, baby.
Hell, yeah.

396
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,411
Can I have one? Yes, and you will notice
the advantages almost immediately.

397
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,330
Here. Try this.
I feel like drinking wine out of a can...

398
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,208
is conducive to my violent
hand gestures when I speak.

399
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,210
You tend to be very emphatic and
strong and- There's no spillage.

400
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,337
Say I wanna give one to Frank.
You didn't get any on me.

401
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,381
I spilled a little.
You wanna point accusatorily, but...

402
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,883
But it really boosts
your mobility.

403
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,386
Excuse me.
Excuse- Excuse me.

404
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,808
People, I- I'm sorry, but how do
you guys wanna proceed from here?

405
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,476
Because I'm a little confused.

406
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,311
Ohh!

407
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,313
Did you wanna-
Right. Okay.

408
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,317
Um- Well, I guess we kind of got what
we needed out of the intervention.

409
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,027
Yeah.
Right? So good job.

410
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,112
Was it? Did she?
We did all the work, didn't we?

411
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,824
So we can't really
pay you 'cause of that.

412
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,660
I know we said we would,
but we won't. Yeah.

413
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,871
Um, how about a can of wine?
[Dennis] Oh.

414
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,252
[Scoffs] No.

415
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,046
Oh.
All right. Well...

416
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
Okay, well, on your way.
Adios.

417
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,757
On your way then.
Take your jacket.

418
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,092
Get out of here.

419
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
Take that shoulder-padded
jacket and get the hell out.

420
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,136
Thanks for stopping by.

421
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,805
Don't expect
a check in the mail.

422
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,098
Hey!
Up top!

423
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,599
Up top, everybody!
[Dee] Great intervention!

424
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,560
Great intervention!
Great intervention work!
