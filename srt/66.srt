1
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:07,474
Here comes
my main man, Matty.

2
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:08,596
Time for a haircut, Matty, though.

3
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,450
Don't make me give it to you.

4
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:11,451
You the man, Professor.

5
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,886
You're the man if you
stay in school, JJ.

6
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:14,887
All right.

7
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:15,755
All right, you.

8
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,223
Lisa, how's the GPA?

9
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,192
Keep it up, up, up, up, up!

10
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,860
Professor!

11
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:22,462
Hey, there's my man.

12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:23,896
Oh, time-out, son!

13
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:25,064
Hang on, son.

14
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:27,033
Uh, did you forget something here?

15
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:27,700
Sorry?

16
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,435
This orange, it belong to you?

17
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:30,236
Uh, no.

18
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,271
Looks pretty good, not too peeled.

19
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:33,673
Pretty intact here. You want it?

20
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,042
No, thanks, I'm cool, Professor.

21
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,244
You're cool?
Well, when you're cool, you're cool.

22
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:39,912
Hey, Dee, how's it going?

23
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,749
Teacher's lounge. Pretty sweet.

24
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:43,516
How'd you swing that?

25
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:44,984
I'm a teacher now, Charlie.

26
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,220
I'm subbing for Dr.
Myers while he gets his hip fixed.

27
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:48,654
Look at us with our new careers, huh?

28
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:49,322
How about that?

29
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,224
Well, yours is kinda the same,
you know, 'cause you've

30
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,592
always sort of been a janitor.

31
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,227
Ah, but I'm thriving here,
I'll tell you what.

32
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:56,662
Uh-huh, yea Did you get that
orange out of the garbage?

33
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,363
I sure did.

34
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:58,097
Can you believe that?

35
00:00:58,165 --> 00:00:59,866
Someone threw this away,
perfectly good orange, you know?

36
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,868
They were digging at it a
little bit and must've

37
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:03,669
given up, but...
Don't eat trash, Charlie.

38
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:05,838
I'll eat what I want to eat, okay?

39
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:08,408
Miss Reynolds, please
report to the front office immediately.

40
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,675
You have an emergency call.

41
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:11,844
Miss Reynolds, to the
front office, please.

42
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:12,645
Emergency?

43
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:15,481
Jump on that.

44
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,649
Hello.

45
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:18,684
Yeah, hey, Dee,
it's Dennis, Mac and Frank.

46
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:19,585
Hey, what's the matter?

47
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:22,321
I've only just heard, I've only
just heard your belly's so

48
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,991
fat, you make John Candy
look like Lara Flynn Boyle.

49
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:26,592
Snap!

50
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,427
What?

51
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,529
We've been on the
snap-joke kick about your

52
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,931
pregnant body, but since you're not
around, we decided to call you.

53
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:33,533
He's talking about Lara
Flynn Boyle jokes.

54
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,849
I think we got some better ones.

55
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,250
Goddammit, guys.

56
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,001
I am a teacher now.

57
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:42,408
I don't have time for your
shit, you dumbass dickbags!

58
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,542
Wrong number. Sorry.

59
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:57,991


60
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:27,457
Okay, good morning, everybody.

61
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:28,325
Hi. Good morning.

62
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,852
Uh, as you are all aware,

63
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:33,859
Dr. Myers recently broke his hip, and

64
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:36,514
unfortunately, I've been given some

65
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,111
devastating news that
he's taken a turn for the worse,

66
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,558
and he's died.

67
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,561
Now while we
all feel robbed of him here on Earth,

68
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:51,829
heaven above has just
received another angel.

69
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:58,922
And that is what you call...a monologue!

70
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:04,260
You guys, you're all going to be doing
your own monologues in this class.

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,584
Now, they're not gonna be as
good as mine just was, but listen,

72
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,651
I don't want you to beat
yourselves up for...

73
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,127
Okay, okay, I'm confused.

74
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,011
So, Dr. Myers isn't dead?

75
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,394
No, no, no, not dead.

76
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:15,879
Very much alive, but that's
the power of acting.

77
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,806
Do you see what I'm saying?
One minute dead...

78
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:20,225
The next minute alive...
Resurrection.

79
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,603
It's all acting.
Everywhere there's acting.

80
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:23,711
Let's talk about you guys.

81
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,305
Why don't you tell me, uh,
what your favorite play is.

82
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:32,874
Raise your hand if you've
ever seen live theater.

83
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:36,746
Seriously? Are you kidding me?

84
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,070
All right, that's it.

85
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,702
I am taking you guys on a
field trip to Broadway!

86
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,239
I'm taking you to New York City.

87
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,910
Yeah!

88
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:55,979
Hey, fat bitch, how you
doing today, Richard?

89
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,414
He's a happy clown.

90
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:00,126
Hey-hey-hey, break it up, break it up!

91
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,176
Oh, come on.

92
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:03,386
All right, which one
of you guys did this?

93
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:04,521
Who painted your face, kid?

94
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,340
I did. He's a dumbass juggalo.

95
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,289
Juggalos for life, bitch!

96
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:10,383
Watch what you say, Richard.

97
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:11,695
Hey, hey, you watch what you say!

98
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:12,629
All right, you know what?

99
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:14,464
I want the three of you
out of the bathroom.

100
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,399
I'm talking to the clown.
Let's go.

101
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,865
And I got my eyes on you guys
for the rest of the year.

102
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,175
Yeah, I've sized you up,
I've strip you down.

103
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,571
I don't like what I see.

104
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,639
I'm not impressed.

105
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:24,774
Big tough guys, huh?
Big tough guys!

106
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:27,177
All right, kid, what's going on
with the clown makeup, though?

107
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:28,812
You're sticking out like a sore thumb.

108
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,690
That's 'cause I'm a juggalo... ICP!
Insane Clown Posse, yo.

109
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,518
I don't know what that...
You have a posse? Well, good.

110
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,940
Stick with your insane clown
people, and you won't get jumped.

111
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,689
They're a band, dude.

112
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,655
I'm, like, a die-hard fan.

113
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:42,659
We're called juggalos.

114
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:44,661
Where are you real friends, dude?

115
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,420
I lost all my friends.

116
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,145
Aw, shit, man.

117
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,056
I lost all my friends, too.

118
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,477
All right, I'll tell you what.

119
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:56,300
You know, if you want to wear your
clown makeup in school, wear it.

120
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,941
I got your back.
You won't get jumped.

121
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,643
Yeah, I ain't exactly allowed to
wear my makeup in school, though.

122
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:01,311
Oh, really?

123
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,658
- Bunch of bullshit, dawg!
- That is bullshit!

124
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:05,927
All right, kid, today's
your lucky day, all right?

125
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,836
We're gonna talk to
the principal, okay?

126
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:10,912
'Cause the Professor just
took an interest in ya!

127
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:15,088
I'm bored to tears!

128
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,534
Let's go harass Charlie and Dee.

129
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,196
We don't need Charlie and
Dee to have fun, okay?

130
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:22,065
We can figure out something
to do without them.

131
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,435
Hey, you know, guys, now might be a good
time to do our Lethal Weapon 5 reshoots.

132
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:28,405
Why would we do reshoots on that?
That movie was perfect.

133
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,940
Yeah, I was great in it, and
my villain was very evil.

134
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:32,609
Yeah, no, you did a great job, Frank.

135
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:34,213
I'm not talking about that.
Your villain was amazing.

136
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,194
I'm referring more at the black face.

137
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,629
- With its all...
- What's wrong with the black face?

138
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,817
Well, I seriously regret
switching parts with you halfway

139
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,505
though and letting you play
Murtaugh in blackface.

140
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,567
I feel like it was in very
poor taste in retrospect.

141
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:48,758
I think it was in poor taste that you
were doing Murtaugh in whiteface.

142
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,177
I mean, for God's sakes, Dennis,
what message does that send?

143
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:54,008
A lot of great actors
have done blackface.

144
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:57,679
Oh, you know, there's countless examples
of very classy actors doing blackface.

145
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:01,112
Let's see, we've got the great C.
Thomas Howell in Soul Man,

146
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:03,514
we've got the Wayans
brothers in White Chicks.

147
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,942
That was a very tasteful
example of reverse blackface.

148
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,610
Okay, those are bad examples, okay?

149
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:11,424
There's tons of good examples of old
movies with... Frank, help me out.

150
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:13,252
Laurence Olivier in Othello.

151
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,248
Laurence Olivier in Othello, dude.

152
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,365
That's, like, the classiest
actor of all time. Perfect.

153
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,825
Yeah, but I guarantee you there
was some black people that

154
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,358
were working on that movie that were,
like, "Man, what dat white man doing?

155
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,227
Come on. That ain't right.
Get a black man."

156
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:25,061
Okay, so hold on.

157
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,062
What kind of voice is that?

158
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,797
You're doing a black voice
and that's not racist?

159
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,033
I'm just saying that's how black people
talk. That's not racist.

160
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,869
So you would do a black guy
with a black voice,

161
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:34,516
but not a black guy with a black face?

162
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,606
I don't have a problem at all
with doing a black voice.

163
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:39,309
That's just an accurate portrayal...
I don't understand that, dude.

164
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,588
I'm just saying it's just about
doing it tastefully, okay?

165
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,638
Yeah, and you got to
make the lips funny.

166
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:44,540
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

167
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,315
- No, no, no. What?
- They have to be funny.

168
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,050
The lips have to be outlined.
It's not about being funny at all, okay?

169
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,868
It's not about funny.

170
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:52,388
It's about...
Oh, my God, I'm getting pissed off!

171
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:53,923
Well, you can't do the
voice without the lips.

172
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,291
Okay, all right, everybody calm down.

173
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,393
Clearly, we're not gonna come
to any conclusions here today,

174
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:58,328
so let's move past it.

175
00:06:58,395 --> 00:06:58,995
Let's do something else.

176
00:06:59,063 --> 00:06:59,662
Okay, right.

177
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,363
We can find something to do.

178
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,064
Let's just figure it out.

179
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:01,764
Let's just figure it out.

180
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:02,532
Let's put our heads together.

181
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,534
Come on. Think, think.

182
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,369
So, you want
to take them to New York.

183
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:12,537
Yes, to Broadway.

184
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:16,140
And I tell you what, I brought it up...
the kids are super stoked about it.

185
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,742
Now, let's talk hotel rooms.

186
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,714
Um, you know, I-I... I guess the first
point I'd like to... to make... Mm-hmm?

187
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:25,149
...uh, Miss Reynolds, is,
uh, you are a substitute.

188
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:26,284
That's right.

189
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,520
So I really don't think you should be
hauling students across state lines.

190
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,822
Hmm.

191
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,492
Secondly... secondly, the
funding for arts programs here

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,028
is pretty much...
it's pretty much nonexistent.

193
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:38,029
Oh.

194
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:40,465
It's shameful, but that's the way
it is, so even if I did have

195
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:46,838
the money, I would never... and
I emphasize never... give it to

196
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:48,373
someone whom I've just met.

197
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,374
Knock, knock, knock.

198
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:50,375
Uh, am I interrupting?

199
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,377
Yes, we're right in the
middle of something.

200
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:53,378
Hey, Dee.

201
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,380
She's not giving you too
much trouble, is she?

202
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:56,381
No.

203
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,382
Oh, my gosh.

204
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,383
So you two know each other.

205
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,385
No, we met in the...
Yeah, we're best friends.

206
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:01,386
Best friends.

207
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:02,498
We're best friends.
Excellent.

208
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:06,524
Uh, Principal McIntyre, I recently, uh...
I started mentoring one of the kids here.

209
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:07,525
Really?

210
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:09,527
That's odd, because you're a janitor.

211
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,598
Yeah, uh, but Ritchie here is a
hell of a kid, and he's struggling.

212
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,234
You see, he's what he
calls, uh, a juggler.

213
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,668
Juggalo, bro.

214
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:18,770
Juggalo... he's a juggalo.

215
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,204
It's sort of a clown posse.

216
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:22,774
I figured you and I were getting
tight enough that I could maybe

217
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:27,445
come in here and ask that he be
allowed to wear his makeup in school.

218
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:30,848
Uh, well, uh...
you know, it's school policy that no one

219
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,650
should paint their face.

220
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:35,620
So... that's the rule, and
that's the end of that.

221
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,622
- That's the rule.
- Yep.

222
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:39,624
- There's no wiggle room there.
- No.

223
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:40,625
All right, tell you what.

224
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,627
I'll take him down to the locker
room, I'll lather him up real

225
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,629
good, I'll strip all these
silly-ass clothes off him, and

226
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:45,630
I'll clean him, sparking clean.

227
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:46,631
Brand-new kid for you.

228
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:47,632
Bring him back up.

229
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,634
No, no, no, please, don't
bathe the students.

230
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,183
You're right.

231
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:53,638
He's a big man.
He can bathe himself, can't you, Rich?

232
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,641
Yeah, dawg... All right, he's
bathing himself, and I'm watching.

233
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,642
Let's go, Ritchie.

234
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,643
You're getting cleaned up.

235
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,644
Come on!

236
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:00,755
Oh, I'd rather you
didn't do that, either.

237
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:03,347
Okay, there it is.

238
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:05,100
Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer.

239
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,350
How is that not racist to you?

240
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,888
Okay, this is a terrible
example of blackface.

241
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,781
This guy isn't even
trying to look like a real person.

242
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,749
Well he almost got the mouth right...

243
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,306
That's what I'm saying about the lips.

244
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:16,522
They got to be...
The lips are the most offensive part.

245
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:19,597
Look, the guy is bugging his eyes
out like a cartoon character, okay?

246
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:20,721
This is racist as shit.

247
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,344
All blackface is racist, Mac, and
that is the point I'm trying to make.

248
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:26,784
You just cannot cast a white man as a
black man and paint his face black.

249
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,411
- You can't do it.
- They're actors.

250
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,133
They're trying to create an illusion.

251
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:33,231
You know, in the Lord of the Rings
movie, Ian McKellen plays a wizard.

252
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:35,404
Do you think he goes home at
night and shoots laser beams

253
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:36,733
into his boyfriend's asshole?

254
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:37,904
I don't think so, dude.

255
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,384
Tom Cruise is a midget, all
right, but he plays guys that

256
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,386
are normal size in movies, right?

257
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,350
Yeah, but again, nobody's
buying that, either.

258
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,397
Okay, look.
Look at this.

259
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,814
This is Laurence Olivier in Othello,
and this is James Earl Jones.

260
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:48,961
Now, look at how close they look.

261
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,975
Look at that... James Earl Jones
is doing a great blackface.

262
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:55,015
James Earl Jones has a black face!
He's a black man.

263
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,282
- He's not black. James Earl Jones...
- Of course, he's black!

264
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,454
He was Darth Vader!

265
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,719
Darth Vader was black?

266
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,930
See, okay, there we go.
Darth Vader was not black.

267
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:04,654
They took the mask off.
He was white.

268
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,008
I'm telling you, look, look.
We got to agree on this.

269
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:12,664
The whole idea is getting the
right color shoe polish.

270
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:13,698
No!

271
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,567
Oh, Frank, if you're starting
with shoe polish, you're

272
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:16,651
starting off on the wrong foot, buddy.
No way.

273
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:17,651
Shoe polish? Come on.

274
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:18,783
And he's on your side.

275
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:20,319
Stop arguing for me, okay?

276
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:21,940
- I got it.
- Hold on, this is Dee.

277
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,176
Let-let's... Hey, hey, Dee, uh, can
you weigh in on something for us?

278
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:26,845
We're trying...
Hey, no, no time.

279
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:28,300
Uh, listen, I need you
to do something for me.

280
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,284
Can you clear out the bar?

281
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,516
Because I'm going to bring some
students from the classroom

282
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:32,912
by, and we're going to
screen a movie there.

283
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:33,933
Why?

284
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,187
Because I need these kids to
respect me, you know, and I want

285
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,356
to show them how cool I am, so...
plus I feel like this

286
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,792
would be a really good opp...
Oh, Dennis, Dennis, cover it up, cover it up.

287
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,354
This is an opportunity to screen Laurence
Olivier's Othello movie, you know?

288
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:45,588
Then we can get an
audience to weigh in.

289
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,504
That's not a bad idea.

290
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,472
We can really take the temperature
on this with a large group.

291
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,241
Yeah.
Kids are honest as shit.

292
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:50,942
Yeah.

293
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,197
Hi! Hello!

294
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,578
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, Dee, we're on it.

295
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:54,633
We'll take care of the movie.

296
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,641
No, no, you're not taking
care of the movie.

297
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:57,882
You're not railroading
me on this, okay?

298
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,011
This is my thing, it's my movie.
Don't... I'll do the movie.

299
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,621
No, Dee, it's a classic.
Okay? It's Shakespeare.

300
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,455
Othello, Laurence Olivier.
Come on.

301
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,562
Othello.

302
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,445
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to apologize.

303
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:09,017
That's actually a really good idea.

304
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:11,981
Ooh, plus it'll give me the opportunity...
Okay, enough of that.

305
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:14,160
Guys, let's get set
up for a screening.

306
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,073
All right, let's do it.

307
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,579
Uh, gentlemen, hello.
How do you do?

308
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,069
Long time, no see.

309
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:25,406
I'd like to introduce you
to my protégé Ritchie.

310
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:26,894
- Ritchie, these are the guys.
- Oh.

311
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:28,949
Hello. What up?
Juggalo for life.

312
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,803
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Drop it with the whole juggalo thing.

313
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:32,760
You're embarrassing me.

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,278
Okay, now, I know you're all
super stoked about watching

315
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:39,585
a movie in a bar, but we're just
going to keep it on the down-low.

316
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:40,310
You know what I mean?

317
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,087
We don't need your parents and
the principal finding out.

318
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,183
It's just our little secret.

319
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,845
- I've been in a bar before.
- No, you haven't.

320
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,001
I've been in this bar before, so...
Okay, you know what?

321
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:50,172
Let's just watch the movie and
stop with our smart mouths.

322
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,317
Without further ado, Othello.

323
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:54,848
So I guess this is a
Shakespearean movie.

324
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,701
It's going to be a little bit boring.

325
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,260
Oh, shit, Lethal Weapon 5!

326
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,261
This is great.

327
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,029
What the hell is this?

328
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:11,696
It's our movie.

329
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,131
It's a much more modern-day
example of blackface.

330
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,833
Yeah, it's the most direct way
to clear up our argument,

331
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,167
Dee, so...
What argument?

332
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:16,935
What are you talking about?

333
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,406
The movie's on.

334
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:27,660
This is a good movie, Ritchie.

335
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,746
You're going to enjoy this.

336
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,506
Man, I ain't seen the
first couple, though.

337
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:52,003
Happy retirement, Rog.

338
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,440
I'll be happy when I'm far away
from your sorry ass, Riggs.

339
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,876
Just blow out the candles,
Rog, make a wish.

340
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,879
Ah, I never know what to wish
for with these damn things.

341
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,914
That voice really is amazing, dude.

342
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,149
Oh, thanks, man, thank you.

343
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:08,219
Riggs, Murtaugh, bad news, fellas.

344
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,220
Hey, Captain.

345
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,989
Turns out another person just
died from tainted tap water.

346
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,996
Turns out someone taint... someone
tapped the tainted water supply.

347
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,773
We should have cut him out completely.

348
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:22,083
The person who just died was your wife.

349
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,334
Riggs...

350
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,051
Yeah, Rog.

351
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,812
I just thought of my wish.

352
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,867
You like sharks, Detective?

353
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,869
Powerful and majestic creatures.

354
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,870
What is going on?

355
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,537
Where are you?

356
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,306
Frank splurged on a green screen.

357
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,174
Yeah, but he wouldn't pay for
the green screen on our side,

358
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,109
so...
We're not in the back office.

359
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,345
We're-we're in a casino.

360
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,164
Why would I know anything
about the tainted water?

361
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:14,852
Maybe because your rival tribe owns the
water rights to half of Los Angeles.

362
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,889
I need clean drinking water, too!

363
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,959
Even sharks need water.

364
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:31,368
Excuse me. If you leave now, I have
some pressing matter to deal with.

365
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,565
Kinda comes out of nowhere,
but at least it's classy.

366
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,367
Here comes the turn.

367
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:11,276
I don't know why we, uh...

368
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,279
Oh, Chief!

369
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,601
Don't say anything. Quiet!

370
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:19,984
Quiet. Good. Very nice. Oh!

371
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,152
Oh, come on.

372
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,086
This is unwatchable.

373
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,254
Gotta dive in.

374
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,389
Just finish already!

375
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:48,112
Now that you're Riggs and not
Murtaugh, and I have caught

376
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,449
you, you are going to get it.

377
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,785
Wait.
You guys switched parts?

378
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,719
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,528
No!

380
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:23,281
As more people die, the city
will be looking to new resources

381
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,250
for water like my tribe!

382
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:32,957
- And you can bet your boots, Detective,
that this time... - This is regrettable.

383
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:39,097
You're supposed to be...
a noble people.

384
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,314
I tire of this conversation.

385
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,634
Do you have any last words?

386
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,436
Yeah, I got some last words.

387
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,573
Go suck an egg.

388
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,744
Oh, yeah, go suck an egg.

389
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,045
Suck an egg?

390
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,448
Sounds like
you guys are having a great party.

391
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,916
Why wasn't I invited?

392
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,864
Oh!

393
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,623
It's playing. It's playing.

394
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,064
Son of a bitch.

395
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,765
This is the greatest
movie I've ever seen.

396
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,133
Are you filming this, Ritchie?

397
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,134
No. Come on, dude.

398
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,135
That's-that's bootlegging.

399
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,319
I'll get you a copy, don't bootleg.

400
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,612
Okay, you want to dance?

401
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,493
How about a little tainted tap water?

402
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,627
Oh.

403
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,433
Yes! Yes!

404
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,044
Great job, Rog.

405
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,113
That's one... fried turkey.

406
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,722
All right.
Let's get out of here.

407
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,604
We got 'em... baby.

408
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,912
I miss you, kid.

409
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:40,030
♪ There's a hungry road backed with
lonely hopes gonna eat me up... ♪

410
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,213
Okay. Wow.

411
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,561
I think that video says
more than I ever could.

412
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:47,974
As does that.

413
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:51,813
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,487
So... we're fired, yeah?

415
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:56,866
Oh, absolutely.

416
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:57,554
Yeah.

417
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,178
Probably never should have been hired
in the first place, though, huh?

418
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,655
That was my bad.

419
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:02,858
Right, that's on you.

420
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,946
Yeah, I probably won't be
here much longer myself.

421
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,419
No, I don't imagine you will on
account of the...

422
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:10,712
I got something that might cheer us up...

423
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,196
Aah... Who wants a little bit of...

424
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,931
a little bit of deliciousness here?

425
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:16,739
I'm not gonna eat that.
