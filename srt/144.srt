1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,707
<i>Hey, look what I just found,
at the bus stop.</i>

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,143
"Gruesome twosome seek exotic

6
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,388
- Nice. - Wha... what?
- Yeah. It's a good ad.

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,924
You know, we got the Airbnb
idea from Dennis and Mac,

8
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:25,729
- 'cause they're doing it.
- Yes, but we're not posting

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,094
creepy flyers at bus stations. I mean,
w-what kind of people do you think

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,164
- you're gonna attract with that?
- What?

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,432
Young Bohemians with
no sexual boundaries,

12
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,801
w-who don't mind a
shitter down the hall.

13
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,336
Yeah, like, European backpacking chicks

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,405
- who stay in hostels and stuff.
- Yeah. Free.

15
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:39,990
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't be jealous

16
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,844
when Charlie and I are up to our
eyebrows in Viennese gash.

17
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,178
- Ugh.
- Ugh, gross.

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,613
Come on, man.

19
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,114
Guys, don't try to lump yourselves in

20
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,950
with what we're doing, okay?
What we're doing

21
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,918
is very charming and romantic.

22
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,855
- We're setting up a meet-cute.
- Ah, a-a w-what?

23
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:56,956
Are you trying to say, uh, "meat cube"?

24
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,926
- Like, a little cube of meat?
- Meat?

25
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,462
- Because that's a good idea, actually.
- No.

26
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,829
We're doing a meet-cute.

27
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,165
It's-it's where two soul mates meet

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,001
under charming and/or
cute circumstances.

29
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,837
- Like, from a rom-com.
- No.

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,471
- Let-let's keep the trap simple.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,340
Well, don't call it a trap,
because that's not romantic.

32
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:16,409
Yeah, I'm sure for Dennis, it's a trap.

33
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,881
_

34
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,354
<i>Coming.</i>

35
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:45,023
You must be Lisa.

36
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,659
- And you must be Mac.
- That's right.

37
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:50,095
Come on in to my very
spacious apartment.

38
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,531
This is gonna be your room here,

39
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,031
- and I think that...
- Hello. Oh...

40
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:55,668
Hello, I'm Dennis.
I'm here for the room.

41
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,203
Oh, my God. Dennis, no.

42
00:01:58,236 --> 00:01:59,838
Y-You're supposed to be here next week.

43
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:01,074
No, it was this week.

44
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,908
Uh, for sure it was this week.

45
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,211
Oh, my God, it<i> was</i> this week.

46
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,012
- You know, this is, this is humiliating.
- Did something happen?

47
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,680
- I must have overbooked...
- Oh.

48
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,249
- ...this Airbnb, and that's a problem...
- Oh, my gosh.

49
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:13,686
- ...because we only have the one room, so...
- We can work this out,

50
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,420
because I think we can probably stay

51
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,589
in the same room to-together.

52
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,358
It wouldn't bother me if
it wouldn't bother you.

53
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,727
I mean, I-I don't like to come
off as a difficult person.

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,534
- Um...
- Oh. Now, d-do you like to come off

55
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,207
- as a difficult person?
- No.

56
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,208
- No. Of course not.
- Oh, no.

57
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:28,534
- Who-who would? Who would?
- Yeah. No, no one likes

58
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,635
to be a difficult person,
so we can make it work.

59
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,904
- I'm Dennis.
- Uh...

60
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,440
I don't think my husband
and I would be comfortable

61
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:35,909
sharing a room.

62
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:38,743
Husband?

63
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:42,415
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that you were married.

64
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,749
- I didn't realize I had to tell you that.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:47,420
- Oh...
- Uh, hi.

66
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:49,555
- Uh, one of you guys must be Mac.
- Yeah, that's me.

67
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,656
- You, you're the husband.
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,291
I see. Uh, this is Dennis.

69
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:55,061
- What's up?
- He's also gonna be staying here.

70
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,040
- Well...
- Yeah, you know what?

71
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,441
Maybe we should just get another room.

72
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:58,934
- Oh, no, no. I mean, maybe.
- We're gonna make it work.

73
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,435
Well, you guys crash in there,

74
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,735
- and Dennis will stay in my room.
- Uh, I don't know.

75
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,669
I don't know. I don't think so.
Uh, I'm good.

76
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,438
- I-I'm not gonna.
- Oh, well, it's just that you,

77
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:08,508
you just said that you were
cool sharing a room, so...

78
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,242
Right. Yeah, but I was, uh, you know,

79
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,521
I'm-I'm, but, you know, ch...

80
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,654
Things change.

81
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,448
Yeah. It's just that you
don't have anywhere to go.

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,615
Well, you wouldn't know that.

83
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,151
- Yeah, somehow I do.
- Yeah...

84
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,152
Hey, we're just really tired

85
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,487
and would love to crash, if that's okay.

86
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:23,856
Absolutely. Yeah, you guys,
you guys hit the hay.

87
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:25,658
We're probably gonna hit the hay, too.

88
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,092
- Thank you. - All right, yeah.
Best of luck. - Absolutely.

89
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,361
- Thank you.
- Yeah, we're gonna work it out.

90
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:29,629
- It's not gonna be an issue.
- All right. Thanks.

91
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:30,730
Have a great night, guys.

92
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,099
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

93
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,499
- Yeah.
- Now, you said they're,

94
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:35,701
uh, where are these girls from?

95
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,636
- Australia? Or what is that...?
- No, no.

96
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,338
They're two Austrian broads.

97
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:41,373
- Aww...
- Alexi and Nikki.

98
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:43,009
Oh, wowee, Frank.

99
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,211
Those names are, those names are like...

100
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:48,647
Before they get here,
we got to lay down some ground rules.

101
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:51,183
When we wind up working the same broad,

102
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:53,386
no eye contact between the two of us.

103
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,987
- Wait, what?
- And they're gonna encourage us

104
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,455
- to explore each other's bodies.
- What?

105
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,659
- A-And that's a hard no for me.
- No, for me, too.

106
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:02,061
- Let's lead with that.
- Wait, what's about to happen?

107
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,155
I'm not sure I want...

108
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,132
Keep your fingers to yourself.

109
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,366
- But have a good time.
- Uh... Hey, can...

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,469
I just kind of want you
to explain what you...

111
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,171
- Yeah.
- ...what you got on your mind here, but...

112
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:14,806
Who the hell are you?

113
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,575
Hi. We're here for the room.

114
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,876
Nah, no, no, no, no, no.

115
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,046
We're waiting for Nikki and Alexi.

116
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:24,216
Yeah. I am Nikki,
and this is my father Alexi.

117
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,586
Oh, shit.

118
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,030
What is this, man?
W-What, what are we doing?

119
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,866
I-I don't want to do this anymore.
Can we stop?

120
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,401
Huh? No, we can't stop now.

121
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,035
We're-we're right on track.

122
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,537
I don't know, man. It just...

123
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,205
It just feels like a-a lot of effort,

124
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:48,573
and it feels desperate,
you know what I mean?

125
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:49,941
Like, I-I never put this much work

126
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,876
into banging some cute meat.

127
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,212
Cute meat?

128
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:54,714
Cute meat. That-that was your phrase.

129
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,114
No, Dennis, "meet-cute."

130
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:58,583
It has a name, Mac. Its name is Lisa.

131
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,385
This is fun, right?
This is the banter. This is the,

132
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,587
this is... this is all
a part of act one banter.

133
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,890
And we are right on schedule.

134
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:06,722
Shh. Listen.

135
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,228
They're fighting.

136
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,563
I'm telling you,
their marriage is on the rocks.

137
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:12,664
What-what, wait-wait-wait.

138
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,366
What's that third noise?

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,068
Dude, i-is that, like,
a chicken or a parrot

140
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:18,037
or some shit?
Dude, uh, I thought we said no animals.

141
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,738
Mac, tell them no animals in my room.

142
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:20,783
That's no animal.

143
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:25,243
- Oh...
- We needed reinforcements.

144
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:27,079
- Okay, catch me up to speed.
- Shh, shh.

145
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,914
- Listen, listen.
- You can't keep blaming me

146
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,050
- for what happened with Teddy.
- Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

147
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,385
- Who is Teddy?
- Mm...

148
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,121
The wife must have
cheated on the husband

149
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:36,455
with some guy named Teddy.

150
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:37,890
No, no, no, that's all wrong.

151
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,492
The female love interest
can't be a cheater,

152
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,294
because that makes her unlikable.

153
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:45,331
Maybe this isn't a romantic
comedy about the wife at all.

154
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,265
Maybe it's about the husband.

155
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,734
Yes. The husband is the lonely heart

156
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,635
who needs to find love in the big city.

157
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:55,340
Dee, you're my new romantic lead,

158
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:59,206
proving that romantic leads
don't have to be likable at all.

159
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,619
I'm sorry, I can't follow any of this.

160
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,820
- Am I in or out?
- You're out.

161
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,481
- Great. I'm gonna go sleep in the living room.
- Okay.

162
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,685
- Uh...
- Awesome.

163
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,529
Charlie, this is weird as shit.

164
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:19,831
Yeah. Hey... hey, uh, Nikki, what's this

165
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,633
- that we're listening to here, pal?
- Oh.

166
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,469
It's just a little bit
of music that I wrote.

167
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:26,371
Ah, you're a, you're a yodeler, huh?

168
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:30,008
Uh, y-yeah.
Uh, may I ask if you have a small pot

169
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,977
- that I can boil these lederhosen in?
- Uh, yeah.

170
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,013
I got something.
Uh, let me just look around here.

171
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,516
What do you got going
there with the toe?

172
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:41,052
- Does he speak English?
- No, and sadly,

173
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,021
- he refuses to learn.
- Oh, yeah.

174
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:44,856
Oh, yeah, Frank doesn't like
to learn new things either.

175
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,625
Here you go. Tha-That should work.

176
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,159
Ask him what he's working that toe with.

177
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,866
Um, how do you say... There is no word.

178
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,705
Uh, "toe spoon,"
for the digging out of the toe.

179
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,802
- Mmm.
- Don't flick it.

180
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:04,243
Hey, Frank, can I talk to you
for a second over here, man?

181
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,078
- Mind if we just...
- Yeah.

182
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:10,483
Dude, this is weird as hell man.

183
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,217
We gotta...
We're just gonna have to, like,

184
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,551
power through this night,

185
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:14,986
and then we'll figure
something out tomorrow, man.

186
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,822
All right?
We'll just... Let's just get into bed,

187
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,491
and get out of here.
Hey, hey, guys, you know,

188
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,693
- we figure we should just turn in early.
- We're gonna go to sleep

189
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:23,262
- right now.
- 'Cause the night goes quicker, you know?

190
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,029
- We usually sleep ass to ass.
- That's true.

191
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:26,932
But let's see if we can...

192
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:28,734
- I call the side.
- I'll get...

193
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,936
- You got the end, huh?
- Yeah. Picked the side here.

194
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:34,039
- Why don't you hop in.
- All right, I'll hop in.

195
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:35,441
- Yeah.
- All right.

196
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:37,009
Well, ass to ass.

197
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,743
- We're ass to ass.
- Here we go.

198
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:40,779
All right.

199
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:52,491
Fuck this.

200
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,799
Dennis. Come here.

201
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:02,836
- What... What are you doing, man?
- Shh! Shh.

202
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:03,838
Wh-Why are you in their room?

203
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:05,039
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What?

204
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,708
I just set up the perfect
meet-cute for Dee.

205
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,110
- Okay.
- See, Greg's in the shower,

206
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:10,611
so I snuck in there, I picked the lock,

207
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,046
and I just made my way in.

208
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:13,213
I checked him out for a quick second.

209
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:14,649
He has a tiny penis,
just for the record.

210
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,016
- Ah.
- Then, I open up the toilet.

211
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,352
I shit, like,
my brains out into it, right?

212
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,654
I came at this thing
like an animal, man.

213
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:21,221
And then I took a bunch of toilet paper.

214
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:22,523
I-I jammed it in there

215
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,291
so it won't flush; it won't flush.

216
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:26,194
Why?

217
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:27,362
Because when Greg gets
out of the shower,

218
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,630
he's gonna realize that
this toilet is a mess.

219
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:30,965
I mean, it is a splatter-fest.

220
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:32,632
He's gonna look for a plunger.
There is no plunger.

221
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:34,701
I'm gonna send him down
to the hardware store,

222
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,203
where he's gonna run into Dee.

223
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:38,206
Oh, my God!

224
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,240
Greg, y... Are you okay in there?

225
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:43,344
Um, no. I-I think there's
a problem with the toilet.

226
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,646
You may need to get a plunger.

227
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,082
A plunger? Oh, man,
we don't really even have a plunger

228
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:49,550
here in the apartment,

229
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,052
but we have a hardware
store down the street.

230
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:53,253
If you go down there and get it,
I can get you back.

231
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:55,021
Okay. Hey, when did this happen?

232
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,723
Wh-What?

233
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:59,761
The shit in the toilet. It's not mine.

234
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:01,261
Oh, my God, when did that happen?

235
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,001
- Just close the door.
- That's what I'm asking you.

236
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,266
- Okay, now the plan is in motion for you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

237
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,169
What do you mean the
plan's in motion for me?

238
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:09,370
I thought I was out.

239
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,872
Remember when we were saying that

240
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,274
the female romantic
lead would never cheat?

241
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,708
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, well, I overheard Lisa

242
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,111
saying to Greg that she misses Teddy.

243
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:19,280
Huh? Why would she tell Greg

244
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:20,915
that she misses the guy
that she cheated with?

245
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:24,251
Unless she didn't cheat
on him with Teddy.

246
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:25,752
Maybe Teddy was a platonic friend

247
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:28,122
from high school that
makes Greg jealous.

248
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,457
Don't you know what this means?

249
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,427
Lisa is still our romantic lead,
which means...

250
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,728
- So I'm still your leading man.
- Yeah.

251
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,535
- This is crazy, Charlie.
- Yeah, I know.

252
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:43,938
I mean, Dennis is having
meet cubes with hot chicks,

253
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:45,540
- and we're stuck with these guys.
- I know.

254
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:47,107
I want to be having meet cubes, right?

255
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:48,242
Me, too. Me, too.

256
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:50,277
What the hell?
What the hell is he doing?

257
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,445
I don't know what he's doing.

258
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:52,879
What are you...
What are you doing there?

259
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:54,949
What...
What are you doing with the spoon?

260
00:09:54,982 --> 00:09:58,285
You can't get to the
hard-to-reach places with that.

261
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,621
You need a knife. You need an edge.

262
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,123
- Here, take this.
- What, uh...

263
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,424
What are you working on over here, pal?

264
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:05,259
Because, you know, Frank and I have

265
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,261
a very specific diet;
we like to eat pretty clean.

266
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:10,264
And I don't want to...

267
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,998
- That is, uh, sausage...
- Yeah.

268
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,270
- ...mit peanut butter und apricot jam sandwich.
- Hmm.

269
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:20,441
But the trick is to melt
the cheese on the outside.

270
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:22,108
Well, that's right,
you put peanut butter on the inside,

271
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,777
you put the cheese on the outside.

272
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,912
But you don't want to burn
that cheese, right, so you...

273
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:28,615
...so you finish it on the radiator.

274
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:31,452
I do that, too.
I didn't think anyone did that, man!

275
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:33,086
And that is the trick.
That's how you do it.

276
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,355
- That's exactly... Exactly.
- Exactly.

277
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:38,091
Hey, Charlie, this is pretty good.

278
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,294
You can get in there behind the toe,

279
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,864
and it's rounded,
so you don't have a chance

280
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,098
of<i> filletin'</i> yourself.

281
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,166
Probably shouldn't share it,
though, guys.

282
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,602
It's not... That's not sanitary.

283
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:49,636
I got a question.
Tell me if it's asking too much,

284
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,139
but I've always kind of
seen myself as a yodeler.

285
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,141
Would you be willing to
show me how you do that?

286
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:57,111
I would like that very much.

287
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:59,213
For real? Okay, 'cause I feel like

288
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:02,183
if I... if I learn how to yodel,
I'm going places.

289
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,951
You know what I mean?
Because, like, no one...

290
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,554
- no one's doing that these days.
- Charlie.

291
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,223
- Charlie, come here.
- Uh, give me one second.

292
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,324
Yo, what's up?

293
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:12,326
We just got a hit on the apartment.

294
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,027
Two European broads.

295
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,495
Oh, I don't know, man,
things are starting to really

296
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:16,864
- turn a corner with these guys.
- Yeah, I know.

297
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,331
I mean, you know, I'm having fun.

298
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:19,834
- I like the spoon.
- And you got that.

299
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,801
- I guess... Okay, but you know.
- Yeah. Yeah, ooh...

300
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,104
And...

301
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,512
- Sorry, no. We double-booked.
- Sorry, guys. Yeah, I'm so sorry.

302
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:34,915
- We're gonna miss you.
- You know, these things happen.

303
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:37,684
- We-we just double-booked.
- Thanks for the toe spoon.

304
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:40,253
Yeah, thanks so much, guys. Good-bye.

305
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:45,926
Oops.

306
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:46,972
Sorry.

307
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,563
That was pretty cute,
wasn't it, how we...

308
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,682
both reached for the plunger
at the same time?

309
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,347
Yeah, I guess.

310
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,102
Also, looks like it's the only one.

311
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:59,040
It's the last one, so, um...
maybe we could share it.

312
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:01,119
How would that work?

313
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,711
Well, I guess, first you'd
have to come back to my place.

314
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,881
You know, I can always use a man

315
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:09,884
to help me clean my pipes.

316
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:14,622
Help flushing the shit you took
that backed up your toilet?

317
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:17,625
No. No, that's...
No, that's... it wasn't shit.

318
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:19,793
- That's not what I'm talking about. It wasn't shit.
- What was it?

319
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:20,895
- I don't care.
- Okay, it doesn't matter.

320
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,430
The point is that
it's-it's charming and cute and fun

321
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:25,433
how we, how we just sort of
met like this over a plunger.

322
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,634
Don't you think so?

323
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,468
I'm just gonna go to
another hardware store.

324
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,371
Well, okay. Well, hold on a second.
Wait, wait.

325
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:31,905
Don't go.

326
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:35,409
There we go.

327
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:38,513
Pushing away his soul mate,
right on structure.

328
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:40,982
End act two.

329
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:48,992
Hey! It's my roomie. What's going on?

330
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,495
Hi.

331
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:52,596
- I got you some wine.
- Oh, no, thank you.

332
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:55,933
Well, it helps when you're sad.
You seem sad.

333
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,302
But I-I get it. I-I understand.

334
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,704
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

335
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,004
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,707
Yeah, you miss Teddy,
and no one can replace him.

337
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,543
I assume you overheard my husband and I.

338
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,811
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

339
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:09,379
But, look,
maybe I can fill that void, you know,

340
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,983
if only for a few hours of,
uh, sexual bliss.

341
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:14,718
Oh, no. What?

342
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:16,787
Sex.

343
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:18,389
Bangin'.

344
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,125
It's good to take the mind off things.
You know?

345
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:23,127
But wait, l-let me,
let me ease your mind about something.

346
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,562
I'm not the jealous type,
like your husband.

347
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,965
You know, you want to spend
time with Teddy also, uh,

348
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:28,458
that's fine, you know.

349
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:31,168
Dig that guy up, you know,
see what he's been up to these days.

350
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,488
I honestly don't give a shit.

351
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,060
Yeah.

352
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,209
You all right?

353
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,844
- What?
- Oh.

354
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,080
What happened?

355
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,583
This is so bad.

356
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,019
Don't talk about him.

357
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,825
- Okay, that went great.
- Huh?

358
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,325
- Now, next steps...
- Whoa.

359
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,061
How, in your mind, did that go great?

360
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:58,263
- I thought the crying was hot.
- I did, too.

361
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,265
But it just,
it seems like it's gonna be annoying.

362
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,267
I find you annoying.
This whole thing's annoying.

363
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,769
- I'm gonna go back to my thing.
- No, Dennis, this is working.

364
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,604
You just have to trust the structure.

365
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:09,006
- Uh, nah.
- Just trust the structure.

366
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,611
- Yeah... Come on in, come on in.
- Well, yeah, come on in.

367
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,280
Oh, this... this is the spot.

368
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,748
- Sorry it's messy.
- It's a little messy.

369
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:19,250
We had a guest,
and he trashed the joint.

370
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,918
That's right,
the-the guest trashed the place.

371
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:22,854
No, it is perfect.

372
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,755
- Uh, so much space.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:26,124
- Yeah.
- Looks very bohemian.

374
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,459
And I like that the bathroom
down the hall is so close.

375
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,127
- Yeah, it's right, it's right there.
- It's not far, right?

376
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,862
- I mean, there's no door on it.
- Yeah.

377
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:34,464
But that's because the guy in 4B
went berserk and ripped it off.

378
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,767
- Oh.
- Uh, yeah.

379
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,401
And if you do have to use the bathroom,

380
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,569
- what I can do is I can become the door for you.
- Yeah.

381
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:41,905
- I do that for Frank when he's taking a dump in there.
- You stand in front of it.

382
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:43,274
No, no, no, it is okay.

383
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:45,777
We're very free with our bodies.

384
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,044
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah?

385
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,947
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool. Yeah, us, too. I mean...

386
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,382
- I only see one bed.
- Yeah. - Yeah, it's a one-bedder.

387
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:52,916
- Uh...
- Oh.

388
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,552
- We can sleep on the floor...
- No, no, no, no, no. - No.

389
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:55,887
That's no fun.

390
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,121
- We should all share. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:01,291
- Yeah, that's okay with me. Is that okay with you?
- No fun to sleep...

392
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,461
- Yeah, here on the bed.
- Ah-ah-ah.

393
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:05,629
That is not very free with your body.

394
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,831
- Uh... what do you mean?
- Wh-Wh-What?

395
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,900
- We all sleep naked. It's more fun.
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,594
Come, we don't bite.

397
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:13,829
Yeah, just take it off. Come.

398
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,907
<i>So you're telling me</i>

399
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,842
that you got nowhere with Greg?

400
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,509
That's not true. That's not true at all.

401
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,479
Got him right where I want him.
This is the part

402
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:24,614
where I sit back and wait for
him to come to his senses.

403
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,985
Th-That-That's not how it works.
Goddamn it.

404
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,653
This is the part where the trashy skank

405
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:31,656
is-is supposed to lure the husband away.

406
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:35,293
He bangs that nasty snatch,
and then Lisa recognizes

407
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,462
that he is a dullard
and needs to drop him,

408
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,466
so that Lisa,
the true hero of the story,

409
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,968
can figure out that she needs
to be free and find love.

410
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:44,969
I'm the true hero of the story.

411
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,538
You are a diversionary
plot twist at best.

412
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:49,474
And you couldn't even do that right.

413
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,041
Ooh, what a night! Wha...!

414
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,044
- You can't believe what happened.
- Whew!

415
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,812
We got the backpackers we wanted,

416
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,048
and they're as sexually
free as we hoped.

417
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,816
- Those girls are wild, man.
- It was amazing.

418
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:01,417
They wanted us to, like-like,
touch each other and stuff.

419
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,786
I'm like, "Dude,
that's a hard no for me."

420
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,000
No, it was a hard no for me, too.

421
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:05,081
- Well, but...
- I said no.

422
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,357
- I said no.
- You were thinking about it, though.

423
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,359
- All of a sudden, like, Frank gives me one of those...
- No, I wasn't thinking about it.

424
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,561
- I'm like, "Are you kidding me?" I'm not gonna do that.
- No, no, no, I wasn't...

425
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:14,532
I can't even understand
them half the time.

426
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,467
- It's like the accents...
- I don't know. They were crazy chicks.

427
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,668
Hey, hoping you're having fun with your

428
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,637
"meat cube" romance party.
That does sound fun.

429
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:21,505
I do want some of
those meat cubes later.

430
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,341
Dude, that girl with the,
with the long fingernails...

431
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:26,811
Jesus Christ.

432
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,546
Frank and Charlie are off having orgies,

433
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,013
and I'm sitting here all alone.

434
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,350
I mean, this is crazy.
The whole world's upside down.

435
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:35,353
- Up is down, black is white.
- Straight is gay.

436
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,553
That's it!

437
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,157
- What?
- Maybe Teddy cheated with Greg.

438
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:43,394
Maybe this whole thing has
just been one giant meet-cute

439
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,529
for me and Greg.

440
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:47,031
Hmm.

441
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:50,401
You know, it won't play in
Middle America, but screw it.

442
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,502
We'll jam it down their
throats till they enjoy it.

443
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:53,770
W-We'll force them to like it.

444
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,506
- So you'll help me?
- I will.

445
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,174
- And I'll help you, too.
- Get your hand off me.

446
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,009
Yeah, get your hands off him.
We don't need your help.

447
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,510
I think we're probably
gonna end up cutting you

448
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:01,879
out of this almost entirely.

449
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,682
- Uh, Mac, let's go find you some romance.
- Yeah!

450
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:05,750
Shall we?

451
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,417
You know... Okay, but just a heads-up:

452
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,788
It's not gonna work, all right?
Men are not in charge anymore.

453
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,290
You know?
Men-men don't get to just decide

454
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,625
what women get to do...

455
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,464
Hey, Frank.

456
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,466
- Yeah?
- Hey.

457
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,967
Can I admit something to you?

458
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,969
If you're gonna tell me that
was your finger, Charlie,

459
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,269
I'm gonna be pissed.

460
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,072
No, that was, that was definitely Minka.

461
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:29,973
- She's real aggressive with the fingers.
- Oh, my...

462
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,976
I don't get that move at all.

463
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,945
But, dude, something,
besides this violent Euro ass play,

464
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,480
it just doesn't feel right, man.

465
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,748
Plus, dude,
these girls are drug addicts.

466
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,284
I saw them using Alexi's
toe spoon to cook heroin.

467
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:43,453
- What?!
- I don't even think we need to whisper. Like...

468
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,090
- Oh.
- Yeah, they're passed out, man.

469
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:47,290
Oh, dude.

470
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:49,927
This isn't good. This isn't good.

471
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,999
- Yeah.
- Charlie.

472
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,567
- Look, it's done for.
- It's ruined. I know, yeah.

473
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,336
- No, it's-it's ruined.
- Oh.

474
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,272
Hey, Frank,
can I admit something else to you, man?

475
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:04,674
I-I can't stop thinking
about Alexi and Nikki.

476
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:05,776
Me, too.

477
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,912
Like, maybe we made a huge mistake, man.

478
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:09,746
- We might've.
- And I know it's...

479
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:12,016
- that it's two hot girls.
- Hot chicks.

480
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:14,318
A-And you should make
the most of that, right? But...

481
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,021
Because it's good, you know?

482
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,990
- But some-something just doesn't feel right, man.
- Yeah.

483
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,524
Something doesn't feel right.

484
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,026
- No, it doesn't feel right.
- Something's off.

485
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,627
I miss those guys. I miss them. I...

486
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:25,529
- What's that? What's that?
- Oh, that thing?

487
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,498
Oh, yeah. Uh...

488
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,466
Uh, there was a package outside the door

489
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,134
when we came back
the-the other night, and...

490
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,702
- What's it, a gift?
- Yeah, I don't know.

491
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,105
It... I can't read it

492
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,439
'cause it's, like,
in Austrian or something. Uh...

493
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,175
- No, it's in English.
- Yeah. I-Is it English?

494
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,178
"Thanks for everything.

495
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,480
Love, Alexi and Nikki."

496
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:44,048
- Oh, no shit?
- They gave us a present.

497
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,515
They left a gift for us?

498
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:51,822
Meat cube.

499
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,924
Bus station.

500
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,697
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>

501
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,666
Yeah!

502
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,136
I'm just gonna go out to the car.

503
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,672
Yeah, okay.

504
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,075
Nice to meet you. Bye.

505
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,242
Okay, great. Okay, all right.

506
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,911
This is your moment, Mac. Now remember,

507
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:15,145
just speak from the heart, all right?

508
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,547
Sweep him off his feet. Go to him.

509
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:17,714
- Go to him. Yes.
- No, no.

510
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:19,650
Hey, uh, uh, Greg?

511
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:21,719
- Yes.
- Uh, was wondering if we could have a quick chat.

512
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:25,923
Oh. Sorry about that, guys.
Wrong-wrong track.

513
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,591
- Yeah. That was the wrong song.
- Here we go.

514
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,426
Oh, here we go.

515
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,595
That's the one.

516
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,720
Um...

517
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:35,199
I know that what you had
with Teddy was special,

518
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:37,100
and I know that I could
never replace him.

519
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,269
But that's dead and buried now,
man, and you got to move on.

520
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,105
I-I... And I know that it's crazy.

521
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:43,039
I know that it's crazy
'cause we just met, but I feel like

522
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,343
if-if you just give us a chance,

523
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,506
we could tell a love story for the ages.

524
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:53,384
A gay... gay-ass love story.

525
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,052
A-And, yeah,
maybe it won't play in Middle America,

526
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,623
and-and maybe it's not even
ready for the mainstream,

527
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,625
but it'll win a ton of awards,
and it'll get

528
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,559
a shit ton of attention
for the liberal press.

529
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,630
I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

530
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:08,398
I... dumped up your toilet, Greg.

531
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:10,768
It was me. It was always me.

532
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,038
But I did it for us,
to draw us closer together.

533
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,405
- Now, I just think if we can...
- What?

534
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,407
Lisa's here.

535
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,875
- What's going on?
- Lisa,

536
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:19,442
I'm glad you're here.
Thank you. Please come in.

537
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:21,445
We have something to tell you.

538
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:23,781
- No.
- It's time you heard the truth.

539
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:25,316
Greg and I are going to be together.

540
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,616
But know this.

541
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,619
There was nothing that-that
you could've ever done,

542
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,622
because what Greg needed was Teddy.

543
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:34,498
And what he needs now is me.

544
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,459
So, Greg, let me be your everything,

545
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:39,797
just like your old lover Teddy.

546
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:42,566
Teddy was our son.

547
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,804
He died of leukemia.

548
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:49,606
- What?
- Oh, you know what? I think... Let me, uh...

549
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,410
No, you got to, you got to...

550
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,511
Just turn it off. Just off.

551
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,647
Just-just turn it off.

552
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,648
Sorry.

553
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,450
Yeah. I don't have a dead kid's...

554
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:01,852
uh, approp-appropriate...

555
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,326
Um... I guess

556
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,126
we'll let you get back to the healing.

557
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,496
Yeah, you guys do your thing.

558
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,065
Yeah.

559
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:21,204
That's not romantic. Or comedic.

560
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,673
- You think they're gonna give us a bad review?
- Yeah.

561
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,476
I guess we're not gonna get that...

562
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,312
romantic comedy ending after all.

563
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:33,683
- This way, Frank.
- Wait. Oh, yeah.

564
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:34,852
- Nikki?!
- Alexi?!

565
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,787
- Alexi?!
- Where are they?

566
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:39,490
- Nikki?!
- Yeah. Nikki?! Alexi?!

567
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:41,125
No, Nikki, Alexi!

568
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:42,826
- Nikki, wait, wait, wait! Wait!
- Alexi!

569
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,327
- Wait, wait, wait. Listen.
- Hey!

570
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,197
- Listen, please-please, please don't go.
- Hey.

571
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,298
We're the perfect match.

572
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,299
We-we didn't say it before,

573
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,035
- but w-we understand now.
- Yeah.

574
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,336
We feel the same way,

575
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,971
but we must return to our country.

576
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:59,710
But we will return here
exactly one year from today.

577
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:02,480
If you feel the same, be here at sunset,

578
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,481
and we will spend our days together,

579
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:07,251
knee-deep in American gash.

580
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,087
- Wait one year? One year.
- Okay. We'll be here.

581
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,988
- We'll be right here.
- We'll be here. We'll be here.

582
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:13,356
- Alexi.
- Have a good trip.

583
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,592
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

584
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,059
- Bye-bye. Bye.
- Thank you. I...

585
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:17,362
I love you!

586
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:19,830
Oh, man.

587
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,833
What do you think, buddy?

588
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:25,336
He had me at "gash," Charlie.

589
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:27,337
He had me at "gash."

590
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:33,042
- Bye! Bye! Bye!
- Bye.

591
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,278
- Bye.
- Bye!

592
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:39,215
Oh, man.

593
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:40,817
I'm gonna miss 'em.

594
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,096
- Go home?
- Yeah.

595
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,437
Hell of a guys,
you know what I'm saying?

596
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,605
They were, they were great.
They were great guys.

597
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:04,442
Yeah. I mean, a little weird, you know?

598
