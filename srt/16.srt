1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,103
[ dennis ]
most would agree.
<i>[ dee ] I don't agree.</i>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,872
Will you look at your skin?
<i>I am. What's the matter</i>
<i>with it?</i>

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,874
It's all blotchy.
How? I don't see it.

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,777
Dad, will you look at
sweet dee's skin and tell me
it's not blotchy?

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,946
Do I have to listen to
this shit all morning?
Come on.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,748
Frank,
you've gotta be kidding
with these receipts.

7
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,783
We were
actually doing better
before you took over.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,720
Hey! Hey! What's up, guys?
[ sniffs ]
I didn't hear you guys come in.

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,523
Uh, you know,
I was actually in here early
opening up this morning--

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,525
Charlie, we had an agreement.

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,694
This is a place of business,
not your home.

12
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,297
- uh, yeah, I know that.
- not supposed to sleep
in the bar anymore, bro.

13
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,700
- I wasn't.
- you didn't come home
last night.

14
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,236
Oh, okay, okay.
Well, guess what.

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:41,073
- I found some extensive water
damage in the back office.
- what?

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,108
Yeah, so, maybe
I'm not such a bad guy...

17
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,411
For passing out in there
and drinking too much
or whatever.

18
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,782
-that's a terrible excuse, dude.
-well, I drank too much,
so lay off.

19
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,384
Holy shit! Guys, come here!
Come here! Check this out!

20
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,453
Look!

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,655
What?
What?

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,957
That is the virgin mary.

23
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,660
- <i>what?</i>
<i>- oh, take it easy, bro.</i>

24
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,796
No, look. The head
and the arms and the cape.

25
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,564
Does look like it.
Weird.
I don't see it.

26
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,567
What if it's a sign?
You guys, remember,
I wanted to be a priest.

27
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:13,272
That's a water stain, dude.
Or it could be a sign that
we need to get our pipes fixed.

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,108
- what if it's a miracle?
- [ chattering, arguing ]

29
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:20,546
Listen.
It could be a miracle.
It could be bullshit.

30
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,948
There's only one thing
we know for sure.

31
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,752
What's that?
It's a goddamn gold mine.

32
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,522
Well, I'll tell you, jim.
I was in the back office,

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,525
And I'd just finished praying
on my rosaries.

34
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,661
And I was doing some crunches,
you know, working on my abs.

35
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,964
And that's when I saw it.

36
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,133
And I thought to myself,

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,335
"that is definitely
the mother of our lord."

38
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,271
Did my face look fat?

39
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,207
Yeah.
No, don't-don't
screw with me here.

40
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,677
Seriously. It's just
the tv, right?
No, it's been looking fat.

41
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:30,349
So, if you like the virgin mary
and you like beer, come on down
to paddy's pub.

42
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:35,320
- we got 'em both.
- welcome to paddy's pub,
home of the blessed mother.

43
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,857
Would you care to make
a donation?
How much should I give?

44
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,462
Well, what price can one put on
the viewing of a miracle?

45
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,432
Give whatever you can.

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,070
These people are pathetic.

47
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,039
Yeah, dad, I really don't
feel very good about what
we're doing in here.

48
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,041
Well, don't get all
high-and-mighty on me.

49
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,545
I only made four dollars,
deandra. I think I can
live with myself.

50
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,782
Let's move, lady. We got a long
line here. Don't be selfish.
All right. Rollin' on in.

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,485
This is one of
the more ridiculous things
we have ever done, dude.

52
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,555
I will tell you what is
ridiculous-- taking advantage
of the mother of god.

53
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,424
Are you kidding me?
That is a water stain, man.

54
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,327
We are really pushing
our luck with the big guy
upstairs on this one.

55
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,231
Dude, if you don't think
you're going to hell, you need
to take a long look at yourself.

56
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,400
Go look at yourself, bro.
Okay, I'll do that.

57
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,136
- yeah, do it.
- dee reynolds?

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,906
Oh, wow. It is you.
Matthew mara.

59
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,744
We were in physical therapy
together twice a week
after school.

60
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,780
I was the only other person
in physical therapy with you.

61
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,050
Huh.
I wore
the giant leg braces.

62
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,153
Oh, my god. Yeah,
with the leg braces.
Yeah.

63
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,290
Wow. You look different.
Yeah, so do you.
No more back brace, I see.

64
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,659
You look wonderful.
Yeah.
Oh.

65
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,995
Matty mara?
Hello, mac.

66
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,098
I knew it! I called it from
across the bar, even without
the cripple braces.

67
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,302
- so, what? You're a priest now?
- wow! Look at you. Little
matty mara all grown up, huh?

68
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,006
- hey, dennis, little
matty mara's here.
- hey-oh!

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,075
Hey, you come to witness
the miracle for yourself?

70
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:06,779
Miracle's a strong word, mac.
We don't just throw that around
like a football.

71
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,416
Well, you should.
Well, I just came
out of curiosity.

72
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,485
See what you had
at this bar of yours.

73
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,388
- you have to admit
it's her, dude.
- <i>well, it's quite a likeness.</i>

74
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,058
- <i>[ mac ]</i>
<i>yeah. You think it's a sign?</i>
<i>- no, it's a stain.</i>

75
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,860
But, uh,
it's an interesting stain.
I'll give you that.

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,196
Hey, matty.
Hello, dennis.
How are you?

77
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,198
I've been better.
I've been better.

78
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,802
Let me ask you a question, man.
I know it's been years
since we've seen each other,

79
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,937
But does my face look fat
to you?

80
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,307
Well, we've all
put on a few pounds
since high school, so--

81
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,643
Of course. Of course.
But I don't look fat
though, right?

82
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,012
Um, no.

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,381
What did we call you
in high school?
Rickety cricket, dude!

84
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,651
That's right.
Rickety crickety legs.
[ creaking ]

85
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,986
Yeah, his legs were--
[ creaking ]

86
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,857
- yeah. Yeah.
- hey, remember how you would
pass out at parties,

87
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,693
And dennis would tea-bag you?
Yeah, then I would
take the photo.

88
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,465
We'd pass it around the school.
Everybody loved those photos,
matty.

89
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,201
- hey, you still get
balls-to-the-chin cracks?
- no.

90
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,503
Actually, that was
a long time ago.

91
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,805
It would be funnier
as a priest.
Oh, my god. Those--

92
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,041
Those were hilarious.
You don't understand how much
everybody loved those.

93
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,910
- my balls on your chin.
- everybody loved you, man.

94
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,513
I think people
still have copies.
There's a lot floating around.

95
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:18,050
I saw them on the internet!
You were, like,
famous in school.

96
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,387
Yeah, practically. I got a whole
shoe box of those things.
That's partially our doing.

97
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,057
Well, let's-- let's--
I should get going, so, um--
okay.

98
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,059
Hey, hey.
Check it out though.

99
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:31,330
Um, why did you pause
before you said "no" earlier?

100
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,499
I'm sorry?

101
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,869
Well, earlier when I asked you
if my face looked fat,
you kind of paused.

102
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,705
I'm not sure.

103
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,441
Uh, listen, dee, it was
great seeing you again.

104
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,844
- oh, yeah. You too.
- gentlemen.

105
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,380
Cricket.
Later, cricks.
See you, rickety crickety.

106
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,382
[ charlie ]
I love that guy.
How do you know the priest?

107
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,218
- went to high school with him.
- we should get him
to bless the stain.

108
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,554
- why?
- this could be huge, charlie.

109
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,223
I mean, endorsement from
the catholic church.

110
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,126
No. No. See, you guys are
taking this thing way too far.

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,429
You know what I'm gonna do?
Wash my hands of it.

112
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,764
Washing my hands of
the whole situation, lord.

113
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,467
He will smite you all.
God will smite you all!

114
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,237
Okay, uh, we should do it
soon though because the pipe
might leak a little more.

115
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,307
The stain could fade.
You think this priest
would help you guys?

116
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,409
I think dee could
get him to do it.
Yeah.

117
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,812
- what? Why me?
- oh, "why me?" she says.

118
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,614
The guy was in love with her.
He would do anything for her.

119
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,384
- no.
- all right. Remember the time
you said you'd kiss him...

120
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,386
If he ate a horse turd?
He ate the whole turd.

121
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,356
The guy eats the whole thing.
Then she doesn't kiss him
'cause--

122
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,725
[ together ]
his breath smelled like shit.

123
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,728
That's my girl.
It didn't really happen
like that.

124
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,263
No. He ate the whole turd,
and then she wouldn't kiss him.

125
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,800
- hey, come on. This would be
really good for the bar.
- no. Screw you guys. No way.

126
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:46,138
- that's a bad attitude.
- the priest may not do it
because she's getting old.

127
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,474
Oh! Yeah.
<i>What is that?</i>

128
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,909
- your skin's all blotchy.
- no, it's not.

129
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,645
He's not gonna do it.
You got the crow's-feet.
Crow's-feet.

130
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,015
- no, I don't.
- you're getting
the lines there.

131
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,083
Mmm. Five head.
Laugh lines.

132
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,919
You know what?
You guys are such assholes.

133
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,155
I'm gonna see
what I can do.

134
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,194
Take care.
Bye.

135
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,497
Matthew, hi.

136
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,867
Dee. Wow.
What a nice surprise.
What brings you here?

137
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:20,139
Well, the guys and I kind of
needed somebody to come and
bless that stain in our bar.

138
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,643
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,112
Dee, I'm not gonna bless
a water stain.

140
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,281
We don't do things like that.
The catholic church--

141
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,283
Oh, no, no, no.
I know not them.

142
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,318
I was hoping you could
do me a favor.

143
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,223
I realize you were able
to get me to do things
for you in school, but--

144
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:43,429
Oh, you know what? I did.
I kind of led you on a little
bit back then, didn't I?

145
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,031
But I wasn't always
a tease, you know?

146
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,500
Remember? I let you do
all my math homework.

147
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,370
Not sure I follow
your logic.

148
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,039
Well, what about that time
we almost kissed?

149
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,742
You made me eat a--

150
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,744
Look, I'm not blessing
the stain, okay?

151
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,647
Oh, no. Hold on a second.
I mean, the taste of
that thing alone--

152
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,649
No, I can't imagine.
It haunts me.

153
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,552
Of course it does.
I'm sorry, okay?
Forget--

154
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,254
Forget I came by about
the stain. I don't care
about that anymore.

155
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,892
I just-- I know you really
liked me back then, and I know
I wasn't very nice to you.

156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,496
And I think that's just because
I was too stupid to realize
how wonderful you are.

157
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,531
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,036
And for the record,
I think that you grew up
to be very handsome.

159
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,706
You do realize you're
leading me on right now?
I'm a priest.

160
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,209
Am I?
Oh, I didn't even know.
Yeah.

161
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,046
But if you wanted to grab
a drink sometime--

162
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,615
You're still doing it.
Oh, my god.
I don't--

163
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,718
Wow, I--
I think it's just 'cause
you look so handsome in--

164
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,520
Please leave.
Okay, I'm gonna go now.

165
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,222
Thank you.
It would be best.
All right.

166
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,591
God bless.
Yeah.

167
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,897
Would you care to make a
donation in the name of paddy's
pub to the blessed mother?

168
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,134
- mm-mmm.
- charlie, this needs to stop.
If you guys don't do it,

169
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,103
I'm gonna do it myself.
You're telling me.
I'm sick of doing this.

170
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,740
God is going to show
his wrath, charlie.
Excuse me.

171
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,911
Are you the young man to whom
the holy mother first appear?

172
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,547
Yeah.
Could you bless me,
please?

173
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,717
You want me to bless you?
Please, senor.

174
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,721
Uh, yeah, sure,
I guess.

175
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,491
In the name of the father,
the son, holy spirit. Amen.
Right hand.

176
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,462
<i>Gracias.</i>
<i>You're welcome.</i>

177
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,464
Did you see that, dude?
[ chuckles ]

178
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,466
I just blessed that woman.

179
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,569
I may have saved that poor,
wretched old person's life.

180
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,638
Well, I don't know
about that, but, uh--

181
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,640
This could be my calling,
charlie.

182
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,343
What happened to all that
god's wrath business,
and this has to end--

183
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,146
Yeah, I know. Don't worry about
that, dude. I think this could
actually be a good thing.

184
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,582
We could change the world.
Okay, okay.
All right.

185
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,119
New plan, all right?
Let's go around,
let's bless people.

186
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,422
Well, actually, I should bless
people though, but you could be
my right-hand man.

187
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,825
You could be my peter.
Oh.

188
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,860
Okay, I'll be your peter.

189
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,996
Dress a little nicer though,
'cause you look like shit.
<i>[ door closes ]</i>

190
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,899
Hey. How'd it go
with the priest?

191
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,902
Not gonna happen.
Did you put
the moves on him?

192
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,805
First of all, gross.
I don't think you're supposed
to whore out your kids.

193
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,074
Second of all, that guy
is a really good person,

194
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,076
And I've treated him
like shit his whole life.

195
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,113
- for once I'm gonna do
the right thing.
- he thinks you're too old, huh?

196
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,548
Goddamn it.
Why do I speak to you,
ever?

197
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,953
Hello.
Oh, wow.

198
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,621
What is wrong with you?

199
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,191
Oh, well, I've been
fasting for three days,
so I probably look good.

200
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,062
- you haven't eaten anything
for three days?
- and I feel great.

201
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,864
Why the hell
are you fasting?

202
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,834
I thought I would get in
the spirit of the religious
aspect of what we got going.

203
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,303
It's 'cause we said
his face looks fat.
It is not.

204
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,472
People have been fasting
for thousands of years--
face looks fat.

205
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,976
For health and religious
purposes. Moses--
fat face.

206
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:47,346
Jesus and moses in the woods
and in the desert--
pretty fat, right? Fat.

207
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,982
- please listen to me. Please.
- forget it.

208
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,018
Yeah.
All right? The priest thinks
dee's too old for him.

209
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,922
We gotta go to plan "b."
I know another guy
who could help us.

Father o'grady? Uh--

00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,864
I'm frank reynolds.
I was in your parish.

213
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,368
- what do you want?
- we came to talk to you
about a stain.

214
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:13,572
No! Uh, wait a second.
We just wanna have
a few words with you.

215
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,942
We found a stain in our bar
that resembles the virgin mary.

216
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,878
- cats are brown now.
- what?

217
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,248
The cats are brown.

218
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,417
What in the hell is
he talking about?

219

Let's go clean him up.

The good lord is going down
on you? What is that?
What? It's like--

226
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,578
Why are you dressed
like this?
Come on. It's perfect.

227
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,414
Where did you get it?
I have my sources.

228
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,950
I told you to dress nice.
We look like
salt and pepper shakers.

229
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,486
Ah, we look good.
All right.
Let's just get started.

00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,855
Um--
mmm.
[ clicks tongue ]

Ah. Uh, excuse me, sir.

232
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,960
Hello. Uh, would you like
a blessing?
From who?

233
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,163
Well, it was to me that
the virgin mary first appeared.
Well, I found it.

234
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,666
What?
Well, I'm just saying
I was the one who found it.

235
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,002
Yes, but, uh, I was the one
who first recognized it was
the virgin mary.

236
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,905
I found it,
if you want the truth.
You thought it was a stain.

237
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,775
I'd much prefer
a blessing from him.

238
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,612
- why?
- he seems a lot more
religious than you.

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,914
He is my number two
and doesn't really
do the same--

240
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,017
Well, maybe I could just
throw you one of--
don't do it.

241
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,987

don't do it, charlie.
Don't do it! [ sighs ]

Ha!
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

243
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,262
Okay, feel better.
You're looking better
already to me.

244
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:47,599
You are completely betraying me.
You're supposed to be my peter.
You know what, dude?

245
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:51,036
Hear me out for a second.
Now, technically,
that stain did appear to me.

246
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,206
Also, I am familiar with
carpentry and I don't know
who my father is,

247
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,208
So am I the messiah?

248
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,444
I don't know. Could be.
I'm not ruling it out.

249
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,946
The messiah?
I'm just not ruling
it out, is all.

250
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,116
You gotta be kidding me, dude.
Well, the lord works
in mysterious ways.

I knew you were gonna
ruin this. Goddamn it.

this guy to bless anything?
He's out of his mind.

00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,001
Well, I'm hoping it's
mostly the booze talking.

257
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,336
Let's find some coffee.
We can sober him up.

Did you hear me?
Hmm?

259

really gotta eat.

for a second. What's up?

00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,949
Find some coffee.
We don't have a ton of time.

I'm in love with a man--

A man called god.

Does that make me gay?
Am I gay for god?

- you betcha.
- can I talk to you, please?

268

In private.

269

Well, congratulations,

00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,479
You found the four people
on the planet dumb enough
to listen to your shit.

Oh, forgive him, lord,
for he know not what he say.

273
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,785
Give it a rest. You're
not the messiah. You don't
know dick about the bible.

274
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,387
You know, it really sounds
like somebody in this room
is jealous.

Because it's bullshit!
I'm the one that wanted
to become a priest,

276
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,893
I'm the one that knew
it was mary, I'm the one
that should have followers.

277
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,562
Sorry, bro. You suck at it.
You wanna have
a little competition?

278
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,598
Like what?
Let's go toe-to-toe
on the bible, bitch.

279
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,769
Ask and ye shall receive,
sucker.

280
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,578
Forgive me, father, for I have
sinned. It has been 10 years
since my last confession.

In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit,
what's on your mind, my dear?

283
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm in love with a man
that I can't have, father.

284
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,957
And he used to love me too,
but then I was
really mean to him,

285
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,293
And now we'll never know
what could have been.

286
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,962
Well, it's too late now.

287
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,598
He's made a commitment
that can never be broken.

288
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,902
[ sighs ] let's drop this act,
matty. Listen, I think I have
really strong feelings for you.

289
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,971
Dee, please don't do this.

290
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,474
You know what? It just seems
like some kind of cruel joke.

291
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,343
I mean, you wanted me once,
and now that you can have me--

292
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:17,082
And, oh, matty,
I mean you could really,
really have me.

293
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,151
You don't want it anymore?

294
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,920
Well, god has a plan
for everybody.

295
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,523
Well, that seems dumb.
Well, it's not.
It's god's plan.

296
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,760
Yeah, well, god's plan sucks
this time. You know why?
Mmm.

297
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,062
'cause I think I love you,
matthew.
Don't say that, dee.

298
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,498
I have to say it,
and I'm gonna tell you why.

299
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,235
Because if I don't say it,
I'm gonna regret it for
the rest of my life.

300
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,471
Okay, maybe that's not
"god's plan" or whatever.
I don't care.

301
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,674
I want you to know something.
I love you.

302
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:47,012
And I-- I could be your wife,
and I could spend the rest
of my days making you happy.

303
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,716
Dee?
Yes. It's me.

304
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,952
I know it's you.
Just please, please leave.
No, listen. Wait, wait, wait.

305
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,321
I don't know what god
wants for us, all right?

306
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,557
But I do know god
brought you into our bar,

307
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,794
And maybe that was just
so I could say I'm sorry,
but that sounds stupid.

308
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,830
I don't think that's why.
That's not big enough.
He works bigger than that.

309
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,300
Maybe his plan is for us to be
together because he did have you
come to our bar. Matty?

310
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,636
- what?
- open the door.

319
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:38,163
Uh, let's stop there.
Why is god asking moses
to remove his sandals?

320
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:42,835
Well, you didn't let me finish,
dude. It's because moses is
about to walk on holy ground.

321
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,371
No, actually, it's not.
Yes, it is.
That's the next line.

"remove your sandals,
for the place where you are
standing is holy ground."

But what's in between
the lines?

324
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,281
What's in between the lines
is that he has to take off
his damn sandals...

325
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,784
Because it's sacred ground.

326
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,320
No! Sacred ground?
Sacred ground?

327
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,423
God doesn't worship the ground.
God made the ground.

328
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:09,028
And moses is about to
step near a burning bush.
That is gonna be hot.

332
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:21,106

to take my shoes off
and stand on a hot plate.

I'm not gonna do it...
Unless god asks me to.

00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,712
And then I am,
just like moses.

335
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,714
Why? What's gonna
happen to moses?

336
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,916
His feet aren't
gonna get burned.

No. God is gonna reward him
with some sweet-ass shoes.

you get some shoes."

That's the way god works,
