1
00:00:02,547 --> 00:00:03,714
Goddamn.

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:06,183
And how is the psoriasis coming?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,551
Has it gotten any better?

4
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:09,553
Oh! It's not good,
Doc, it's not good.

5
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,323
I'm scaling up like a goddamn
boa constrictor over here.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,892
Skin conditions can be
manifestations of deeper issues.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,891
Well, you're not a skin doctor,
so let's drop it already, okay?

8
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:18,991
I got beef with you.

9
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,693
Excuse me?

10
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,328
I am mad at you!

11
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,631
Remember that cooperative dinner
you had me have with my friends

12
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:26,633
so we could try and resolve
some of our issues?

13
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,767
Well, it blew up in my face.

14
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:28,768
What happened?

15
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:32,138
Uh, screaming and tears and
physical threats, uh, Frank

16
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,340
pulled out his gun, somebody
dropped the "N" bomb.

17
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,709
I don't remember where that
came from, but it was messy.

18
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:39,040
No, I mean why did it all fall apart?

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,281
Oh. No one was assigned the dishes.

20
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,584
And that all happened over the dishes?

21
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:47,053
<i>Yes.</i> And frankly, I haven't
seen any results since I've been

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,355
coming to you, so as far as I'm
concerned, you're in the hot

23
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:51,057
seat until you resolve this.

24
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:52,892
Resolve this...?

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,361
Who's going to do the dishes!

26
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,363
And also, this is a great
opportunity for you to see how

27
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,087
insane my asshole friends are.

28
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:00,432
You brought them here?

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,849
Of course I brought them here--
what, are you gonna come to my house?

30
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,847
Hey, assholes, get in here.

31
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:04,898
Did you guys sort it out?

32
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:05,899
Did you sort it out already?

33
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,901
How long were we
gonna sit out there for?

34
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,904
All right, listen,
lady, I'll tell you one thing.

35
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,137
I ain't doing these goddamn dishes!

36
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:36,941
Sync & corrections by 

37
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:41,973
Therapy is stupid.

38
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,732
I don't trust a shrink.

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,743
They screw with your head.

40
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:49,171
Frank, it's the only way to settle the
argument and find out who is the winner.

41
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:53,042
Okay, uh... let me first just say
that arguments do not have winners.

42
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,010
Yeah, actually,
this argument is more about

43
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,981
determining who the loser will be,
because most of us will be winners.

44
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:01,850
Yeah, yeah, and it's
not gonna be me, okay?

45
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,819
I'm not doing those dishes,
because I had the hardest job.

46
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:04,787
Setting the table?

47
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:05,754
Are you dumb?

48
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:06,755
I hosted!

49
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:07,723
It was wall-to-wall details!

50
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,691
I was on edge the whole time.

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,626
Well, it's gonna be you or Frank or
Charlie, 'cause Dennis and I cooked.

52
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:12,627
The food was mush.

53
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:13,595
The food was divine.

54
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:14,563
It was pheasant.

55
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,099
I never did the dishes before
and I'm not starting now.

56
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,067
I bankrolled; case closed.

57
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:20,769
Well, I had the hardest job
of anyone-- I traveled all the

58
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,538
way to this exotic merchant in
search of this rare fowl...

59
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,507
What the hell are you
talking about, Charlie?

60
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:28,443
You went to the corner gourmet grocery
store and you bought pheasant.

61
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,147
Okay. This is all, you know,
a little bit unorthodox, but it

62
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:36,051
is <i>clearly</i> about much more
than just the dishes.

63
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,019
Yeah, there's always levels.

64
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:39,487
Well, yeah, I mean, we're
complex people, you know?

65
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:44,226
Our rivers run deep, and... I
believe I can help you with this.

66
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:47,129
Let me stop you right there,
actually, Doc-- I can help <i>you.</i>

67
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:50,565
<i>You see, I have a background in
academic psych myself, from an</i>

68
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:54,669
<i>Ivy League college, no less,
not this, uh, LaSalle.</i>

69
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,138
<i>It sounds like a pasta dish.</i>

70
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:58,941
<i>It does, it does.</i>

71
00:02:59,008 --> 00:02:59,908
<i>But let's not be mean, Frank.</i>

72
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:03,345
<i>Some people don't have the
same access that we do.</i>

73
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:05,114
<i>Now, use me as a resource.</i>

74
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:06,448
<i>Think of me as a colleague.</i>

75
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:09,017
<i>Now, I was thinking we could
start with a few one-on-ones,</i>

76
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:11,353
<i>you know, move on to a couple of
mix-'em-ups, you know, and then</i>

77
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,654
<i>end with a big group dealio.</i>

78
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:13,655
<i>I'm going first, please?</i>

79
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:14,623
<i>Can I go first?</i>

80
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,226
<i>Uh, Mac, I'll be the one
to determine who goes first.</i>

81
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:18,360
<i>And it is</i> you.

82
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:19,962
Aah! Yes!

83
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:29,738
You seem very on edge.

84
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:31,706
Yeah, you're goddamn
right I'm on edge!

85
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,642
I hosted the shit out of that party!

86
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,610
And that's just not
setting the table, okay?

87
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,746
I made a playlist, I thought
of cool shit to talk about, I

88
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:42,951
provided security, I kept everybody safe!
Safe!

89
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,588
You know, sometimes I feel like...
I feel like they don't

90
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:50,959
even understand me and we're
not even that good of friends.

91
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:52,060
That's bullshit!

92
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,028
That's bullshit!

93
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,030
We're, like, the best friends
in the whole goddamn world!

94
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:57,332
Goddamn them for making
me think otherwise!

95
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,876
Are you okay?

96
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,411
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.

97
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:12,815
I was just thinking of something that
Charlie said that was really funny.

98
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,783
Mac, let me ask you a question.

99
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:15,750
Yeah.

100
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,021
Do you often feel strong
emotion felt in quick succession?

101
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:20,989
Oh, yeah. And not just my emotions.

102
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:24,392
I have had a slight fluctuation
with my weight recently.

103
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,696
I see. And how much
weight are we talking about?

104
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:32,534
I gained and lost 60
pounds in three months.

105
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,137
Wow, that's almost impossible.

106
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:37,639
Well, first of all, through
God, <i>all</i> things are possible, so

107
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:39,808
jot that down.

108
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:43,011
And yeah, yeah, I had a
difficult time there.

109
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,814
I had to buy all new clothes, and...
people used to cross the

110
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,382
street when I would walk by.

111
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,052
They'd be, like, "Whoa, look at
that monster coming towards us,

112
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,486
you know, barreling towards us."

113
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:54,622
Mac... you're not that guy anymore.

114
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,424
Don't you think I know that?

115
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:59,862
And I'm starting to think that I'll
never become that monster again.

116
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:03,431
Oh, so you preferred
being scary to people?

117
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:07,469
Yeah. Lady, I was as big as a
skyscraper, and now I'm as tiny

118
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:09,137
as a postage stamp.

119
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,539
Oh. I get it. Cute.

120
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:13,475
You leave this pen here and
people are supposed to think,

121
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,810
"Wait, that looks like a dick."

122
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:20,349
Mac, have you ever heard of
the term "body dysmorphia"?

123
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,316
Is that what I have?

124
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:23,285
Is that what's making me so thin?

125
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:26,221
No. Body dysmorphia is when
you see a distorted version of

126
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,656
yourself that no one perceives but you.

127
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:31,326
Oh, but Dennis perceives it,
too, because he's been giving me

128
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,627
size pills to make me bigger.

129
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:33,962
Dennis is, like, my best buddy.

130
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,032
Well, oftentimes, drugs don't
address the root of the problem.

131
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,334
Talking through the issues may
be the best way for you to

132
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:42,570
address your mood
swings and body issues.

133
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:44,439
Talking about it?

134
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:46,008
Talking about it!

135
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,976
No, that's good. That's good.

136
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,879
So if we talk about it, then
you think that I'll get most

137
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,076
bigger... from talking!

138
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,049
Oh, that's really good.

139
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:55,150
You know... thank you.

140
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:56,151
Thank you for this.

141
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,086
You know, when I first walked in
here, I was, like, "There's no

142
00:05:58,154 --> 00:05:59,221
way that this is gonna work,"

143
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,223
'cause I just do not get the
whole woman doctor thing, but

144
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,191
then when you started talking
about God, I realized that

145
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,159
you're one of the smart ones.

146
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,228
All right, let's do it,
let's talk about it.

147
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:08,530
Let's talk about God, and let's
talk about how you're gonna make

148
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:10,598
me more bigger.

149
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,734
Will you put the pen down?

150
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:14,502
Hey-o! Time's up!

151
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,670
Get out, slim. Let's go.

152
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,672
That door is supposed to be locked.

153
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,774
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taped the
knob-- I knew I'd be popping in

154
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:20,742
and out quite a bit.

155
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,743
Let's go. Ticktock, ticktock.

156
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:23,245
Time's up. Ticktock, tiny man.

157
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,212
Okay, let's not get bogged down.

158
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,181
You know, just time for headlines.

159
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,751
Okay. These guys need structure,
Doc, and that'll become clear to

160
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,686
you-- you just don't see it yet.

161
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:37,225
Now, you are gonna want to
strap in for this next one.

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,400
Charlie?

163
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:49,271
Um... why don't you share with
me how you feel the dinner went.

164
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,739
Fine, I'll do the dishes!

165
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,009
You're just gonna make
me do 'em anyway!

166
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

167
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,779
Why do you assume I'm gonna
make you do the dishes?

168
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,881
'Cause it's Charlie work, and
I'm gonna get stuck with it, so

169
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:00,849
I'll just do the dishes!

170
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,384
Goddamn it!

171
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:03,385
"Charlie work."

172
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:04,353
What's "Charlie work"?

173
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,954
Fill me in.

174
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:07,122
Oh, right.

175
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,290
You don't even know what Cha...?

176
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:12,361
Right. Okay, well, Charlie
work is, like, you know, like,

177
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:15,297
basement stuff, cleaning
urinals, uh, blood stuff, your

178
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,698
basic slimes, your sludges.

179
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:20,802
Anything dead, or decay, you know,
I'm on it, I'm dealing with it.

180
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,970
And you dislike it?

181
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,072
Well, no. I mean, at
its core, I love it.

182
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,874
You know, I love the dark, I
love slippery things, I love

183
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:26,841
being naked, uh, in the sewer.

184
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,843
Bleach smells good, uh, tastes
good, you know, but it's just,

185
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:31,213
like, I don't like being
told what to...

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,382
I'm sorry, I didn't get that last one.

187
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,517
I don't like being told what to do.

188
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,685
Everyone's always telling
me what to do all the time.

189
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:38,820
Got it, got it.

190
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,022
Kick me around.

191
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,990
I'm, like, probably the weirdest
guy in the universe, you know.

192
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:43,925
Probably even weirder
than someone from Saturn.

193
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:46,294
Why do you think you're weird?

194
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:47,462
I don't know.

195
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,596
I'm just... weird, I guess.

196
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,798
What did... what did Dee tell you?

197
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,768
I'm not at liberty to discuss other patients...
I mean, like, would it be

198
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:55,737
weird if you survived an abortion?

199
00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:57,672
You know, would it be weird if,
like, you shared a bed with a

200
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,641
man who may or may not be your father?

201
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,609
Again, I can't talk about...
You know what would be weird?

202
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:03,545
If you eat cat food to go to
sleep, and you have such a

203
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,514
fascination with cats that maybe
you glue cat hair on the back of

204
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,481
your neck every now and then?

205
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:09,418
That's new information that I haven't...
You know, I mean, 'cause, so,

206
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:10,252
you know, like, is it bad?

207
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,588
No. No. Being comfortable in
your own skin is never a bad thing.

208
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:14,556
Oh, my God, right.

209
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:16,525
Okay, so if I got, like, more
skin or something, then I

210
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:18,527
could, like, never do a bad
thing in my life, and maybe I

211
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:23,798
never have done a bad thing
'cause I have a lot of skin.

212
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,500
That's not what I'm saying.

213
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:29,471
What I'm saying is, given your...
nontraditional life

214
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,575
choices, you are
surprisingly well-adjusted.

215
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:35,777
Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm
well-adjusted, you know, because

216
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:41,483
of my lack of traditions, and
I'll adjust to that, and...

217
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:45,454
I feel like you're mirroring
my words, but you're not exactly

218
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,255
understanding them.

219
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:50,425
You're saying, like, do the things
you do, go even further with them.

220
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:52,394
You know, maybe get a ton of cat
hair, glue it all over your

221
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:55,730
body, you know, walk around like a cat
man in the night through the alleyways.

222
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:57,899
You know, and stop hiding the pigeon.

223
00:08:57,967 --> 00:08:59,033
The pigeon?

224
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:03,771
This one. You know, let him be who he
wants, let him... let him fly away. Go!

225
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:11,313
He's dead, I think.

226
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,050
So, you've had the... a dead pigeon
in your jacket this whole time?

227
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,786
He was alive at one point, you know.

228
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:21,556
I'm not crazy. It's just, I
think I might have hugged him a

229
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:24,050
little too hard, kind of
smothered him a bit, but, um,

230
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,088
hey, we'll make an adjustment,

231
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,403
uh, to it,
and we'll make a tradition out of it.

232
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,508
Okay...

233
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:02,279
Let's talk about... I
ain't talking about nothing!

234
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:04,230
This skull is Fort Knox.

235
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,684
Why don't you trust therapists?

236
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:10,421
I opened up to a therapist just once.

237
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:14,157
I was a kid.

238
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:15,325
I got into a fight.

239
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,961
The doctor asked me
question after question!

240
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:21,665
Got me so scrambled up.

241
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:26,437
Next thing you know, I was shanghaied
upstate to a nitwit school.

242
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,773
You know what a nitwit school is?

243
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,141
I assume you mean a school
for the mentally disabled.

244
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,645
Yeah. Not just for nuts in the head.

245
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:36,514
Bodies, too.

246
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:40,150
Back then, science was real crude.

247
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,119
They stuck us all together.

248
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,755
My roommate was a frog kid.

249
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,490
You ever see a frog kid?

250
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,091
Frog kid?

251
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,061
Yeah. The place was windowless.

252
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,665
There was a guard every ten feet.

253
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:58,736
All the rooms had drains in the
floors so they could hose us down.

254
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:02,139
How terrible!

255
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:06,811
Got my first kiss there.

256
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,649
Frank?

257
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:16,987
It was terrible!

258
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,823
But not her.

259
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,425
She was an angel.

260
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,393
Always smiling.

261
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:31,702
That's because she had no lips, but her
mouth was still very much in play.

262
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,370
Let's talk about the dishes.

263
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:34,638
Oh!

264
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:37,307
She died two weeks later.

265
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:41,479
She thought she was a space man
with a plastic bag for a helmet.

266
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:43,581
<i>Oh!</i>

267
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:44,748
<i>Aah!</i>

268
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,917
<i>Oh, you unzipped me.</i>

269
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,953
<i>It's all coming back.</i>

270
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,220
<i>It's all coming back.</i>

271
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:51,489
<i>I hate you!</i>

272
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:54,057
<i>It's all coming back, you understand?!</i>

273
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,192
<i>I don't like it!</i>

274
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,694
<i>I don't like to think about it.</i>

275
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,870
<i>Oh, it's-it's... With a
plastic bag for a helmet!</i>

276
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,004
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

277
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:10,207
<i>Oh, you unzipped me. Oh! Oh!</i>

278
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,683
<i>This is me saluting you.</i>

279
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,451
<i>I'm a big fan of your work.</i>

280
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,656
<i>How quickly you rattled their
cages, broke them all down.</i>

281
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,024
<i>It's not about breaking.</i>

282
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:28,291
<i>It's about helping them.</i>

283
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:31,729
<i>Hmm. It's interesting,
our thing, isn't it?</i>

284
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:35,900
<i>To be in someone's mind,
to have complete control.</i>

285
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,170
<i>It's like the thrill of being
near the executioner's switch,</i>

286
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:44,909
<i>knowing that at any moment, you
could throw it, but knowing you</i>

287
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,343
<i>never will.</i>

288
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,045
<i>But you could.</i>

289
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:54,018
<i>Never isn't the right word,
because I could, and I might.</i>

290
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,686
<i>I probably will.</i>

291
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,354
<i>Will you sit down, please?</i>

292
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:58,689
<i>Yeah, sure. Sorry.</i>

293
00:12:58,757 --> 00:12:59,957
<i>Did I make you nervous?</i>

294
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,358
<i>Not my intention.</i>

295
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:02,660
<i>Well...</i>

296
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:05,796
<i>So... who would you
like to discuss first?</i>

297
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:06,997
<i>How about you?</i>

298
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,668
<i>That's good, but we don't
really have time for jokes, so</i>

299
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:13,103
<i>let's jump right into it, shall we?</i>

300
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,573
<i>Now, I've long maintained
psychological dossiers on every</i>

301
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,841
<i>single one of those raving
lunatics in your waiting room</i>

302
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:19,009
<i>right now.</i>

303
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:23,447
<i>The top one, and the thickest,
by far, is Charlie's, of course.</i>

304
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,817
<i>But I'd rather start... with Mac.</i>

305
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:27,952
<i>Oh.</i>

306
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,119
<i>Start with a simple one.</i>

307
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:32,189
<i>Now, how did your session with him go?</i>

308
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:35,392
<i>Dennis, as I think you know,
I'm not at liberty to discuss</i>

309
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,194
<i>another patient.</i>

310
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:40,631
<i>Listen, why don't you think
of me more as a peer, you know,</i>

311
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,200
<i>in the academic sense, of course?</i>

312
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,502
<i>In terms of age, you're
decades older than me.</i>

313
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,770
<i>But why don't I start, okay?</i>

314
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,172
<i>Um, if you'll open up your
dossier there, you'll see there</i>

315
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,508
<i>on the first page is something
that you picked up on almost</i>

316
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:56,179
<i>immediately, which is his
reverse body dysmorphia.</i>

317
00:13:56,247 --> 00:14:00,017
<i>And this... a well-placed pen,
can have quite an effect on a</i>

318
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,151
<i>man like him.</i>

319
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,722
<i>This must have given
him quite the thrill.</i>

320
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:06,090
<i>I bet he tried to suck on this.</i>

321
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,290
<i>Did he?</i>

322
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,458
<i>Huh?</i>

323
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:09,960
<i>It's okay, Doc.</i>

324
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:11,228
<i>You can tell me.</i>

325
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:13,563
<i>He's always sucking on the
pens in our apartment.</i>

326
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:16,166
<i>I'm always having to hide them.</i>

327
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,736
<i>Well, I showed you mine.</i>

328
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:23,707
<i>Why are some of these
pages written in crayon?</i>

329
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,777
<i>My file on Dee was started
in the second grade.</i>

330
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,480
<i>Interesting.</i>

331
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,850
<i>Interesting?</i>

332
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:40,557
<i>Tell me about these size
pills you're giving Mac.</i>

333
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,527
<i>Well, now, that's more like it.</i>

334
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:45,863
<i>So they're Mexican ephedra.</i>

335
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,966
<i>Calling them size pills
was an eloquent solution.</i>

336
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:49,967
<i>The guy was gross.</i>

337
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:50,768
<i>It was disgusting.</i>

338
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,703
<i>He was fat as shit, he smelled
liked shit, he sounded like</i>

339
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:55,906
<i>shit, his groans, his
snores, the sleep apnea.</i>

340
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:56,740
<i>It was gross.</i>

341
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:57,474
<i>He was repulsive, really.</i>

342
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:01,344
<i>So he has no appetite because
you're drugging him, secretly.</i>

343
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:05,582
<i>Giving a man medicine for his
disease-- wherever did I get</i>

344
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,250
<i>that idea?</i>

345
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,990
<i>What are you writing?</i>

346
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:11,191
<i>Writing?</i>

347
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,125
<i>Oh, nothing.</i>

348
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,393
<i>Drawing.</i>

349
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:15,463
<i>Drawing conclusions.</i>

350
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,933
<i>And... drawing this.</i>

351
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,540
<i>You like it?</i>

352
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:29,977
<i>It's very generous.</i>

353
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:33,246
<i>Dee, I'm afraid I have a serious
issue to discuss with you.</i>

354
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:34,247
<i>Yeah.</i>

355
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:38,552
<i>I cannot help you if you
are lying in every session.</i>

356
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,521
<i>Lying?</i>

357
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,389
<i>Why would I be lying?</i>

358
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:43,357
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

359
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:45,158
<i>Why would you... where
are you getting this?</i>

360
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,595
<i>Were you or were you not...
Uh-huh.</i>

361
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:49,730
<i>...the first choice for the
female lead in The Notebook?</i>

362
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,332
<i>Yes.</i>

363
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,970
<i>Yes, I was and I had to,
unfortunately, pass because of</i>

364
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,605
<i>a scheduling conflict.</i>

365
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:58,606
<i>We...</i>

366
00:15:58,673 --> 00:15:59,773
<i>We went over this.</i>

367
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:03,110
<i>I graciously handed it to Rachel
McAdams and she did a fine job</i>

368
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,111
<i>with the film.</i>

369
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,646
<i>I'm secure enough to admit that.</i>

370
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,149
<i>I'm finding all this hard to believe.</i>

371
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,852
<i>Oh, what
do you want to hear, Doc, huh?</i>

372
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,022
<i>That I had cigarettes put
out on me when I was a kid?</i>

373
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,992
<i>That this isn't a surgery scar, huh?</i>

374
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,593
<i>That my father stabbed me? Huh?</i>

375
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,530
<i>Okay, let me interrupt you
for a second, okay, because I</i>

376
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:26,199
<i>think we have an example
happening right before our eyes.</i>

377
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:29,870
<i>You're speaking right now with
a Brooklyn accent and yet...</i>

378
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:30,871
<i>Boston.</i>

379
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:31,805
<i>It was a Boston accent.</i>

380
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:33,607
<i>The accent was clearly from Brooklyn.</i>

381
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,475
<i>This isn't a surgery scar.</i>

382
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:36,443
<i>No, you don't say scar.</i>

383
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,378
<i>That's clearly Brook... Yes, I did.</i>

384
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,312
<i>No.</i>

385
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,214
<i>Okay, the point is, Dee... >>
It's a really good... Hmm?</i>

386
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:43,918
<i>...I just met your father and
I think that little bit was from</i>

387
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,085
<i>Good Will Hunting.</i>

388
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:46,253
<i>Yeah, he's not my father.</i>

389
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,187
<i>That's a whole can of worms.</i>

390
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:48,155
<i>I don't want to go into it.</i>

391
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:50,024
<i>But it was from Good Will Hunting.</i>

392
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,958
<i>How-how did you enjoy it?</i>

393
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,860
<i>I'd rather discuss the father issue.</i>

394
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,595
<i>You know what, she really
wasn't that great, now that I</i>

395
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:55,395
<i>think about it.</i>

396
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:56,229
<i>Who?</i>

397
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:57,130
<i>Rachel McAdams.</i>

398
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:58,899
<i>Feel like I could've done a better job.</i>

399
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,868
<i>Do you think that I would've
done a better job, with that</i>

400
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,769
<i>Ryan Gosling?</i>

401
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:02,736
<i>I've never seen you act.</i>

402
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,638
<i>Oh, really?</i>

403
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:07,274
<i>Uh... ta-da!</i>

404
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:09,443
<i>I've been lying the whole time!</i>

405
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,911
<i>Oh!</i>

406
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,345
<i>So, good, you admitted it.</i>

407
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,114
<i>Uh-uh, that</i> was acting.

408
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:16,416
What I just... right there was acting.

409
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:18,318
I said I was lying, and
that wasn't even true.

410
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:19,186
That was acting.

411
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:20,487
All right, so uh!

412
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:21,655
You are...

413
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:23,090
I am so... I'm good.

414
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:26,660
I am so... How are you feeling
about all of what I'm doing?

415
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:27,795
Did you like that?

416
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,262
Did you think that was good?

417
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,064
Tell me I'm good.

418
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,131
Tell me it was good.

419
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:31,966
Tell me I'm good.

420
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,000
Tell me I'm good.

421
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:33,901
Tell me that was good.

422
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,702
Tell me I'm good.

423
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:35,535
Tell me I'm good.

424
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,137
Tell me I'm good... Tell me I'm good.

425
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:37,972
Tell me I'm good.

426
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,607
Tell me I'm good... Tell me I'm good.

427
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:40,407
Tell me I'm good.

428
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:41,241
You're good.

429
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:42,042
Thank you.

430
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,876
Was it that hard?

431
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:46,246
What is happening?

432
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:50,495
Let it out.

433
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:51,430
Let it out, Frank.

434
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:55,267
Dennis, there was another
twin in your mother's womb.

435
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:58,188
We were going to call him Donnie.

436
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:02,492
You and Deandra devoured him
before he could be born.

437
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,027
You gobbled him up.

438
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,329
That can't possibly be true.

439
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:06,930
Donnie!

440
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,698
You would've been the good one.

441
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:10,734
It would've been Bruce's
kid anyway, Frank.

442
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:11,701
Jesus Christ.

443
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:13,670
I can't take much more of this shit.

444
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:14,637
It's starting to irritate me.

445
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:18,175
Dennis, Dennis, you should do
some quadra-lift thrusters with me.

446
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:19,809
Oh, better yet, get up on my shoulders.

447
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:21,979
That's even better because then
I need more weight on my back.

448
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:23,947
Mac, if you want to get
big, take a size pill.

449
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,015
Take a size pill.

450
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,216
No, thank you.

451
00:18:26,284 --> 00:18:28,485
What do you mean, "No, thank you"?

452
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:29,452
Good for you.

453
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,554
Yeah, I want to do this
the right way, Dennis.

454
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:33,757
The therapist implied that
God wanted me to have bovine

455
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:36,393
hormones and I think she's
going to get them for me.

456
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,262
Dennis, can I give you some advice?

457
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:39,329
Absolutely not.

458
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:42,032
Look, hey, do what you want
to do in life, you know, and

459
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,166
there's nothing wrong with that.

460
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:44,301
Oh, what I want to do?

461
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,469
Mmm, well... that's what I want to do.

462
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:48,438
Oh, well, I applaud you for that.

463
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:49,339
Absolutely, you know.

464
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:50,173
Oh, good.

465
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,442
And now know that, of course,
I'll come back at you with

466
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,410
everything that I have.

467
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,078
What are you...?

468
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:57,680
Get him, Charlie.

469
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,616
Go ahead, get him.

470
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:02,485
Get him, get him, get him, get him.

471
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:03,520
Get him for Donnie.

472
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,354
Get him.

473
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:05,222
How's that? Huh?

474
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,323
You having a white Christmas?

475
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,125
You having a white
Christmas, you bitch?

476
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:09,393
This ends now, lady.

477
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
This ends now.

478
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:13,230
You got Frank all messed up, you
got Mac not taking his size

479
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:15,665
pills, you got Charlie thinking
that he's well-adjusted when

480
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,833
he's the craziest of all.

481
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,068
Stop calling me crazy!

482
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,036
I'm not crazy.

483
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:19,903
You're crazy, okay?

484
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:21,838
You've been eating pigeon
all day and loving it.

485
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:22,772
You all ate pigeon.

486
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,606
What?

487
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:24,408
What?

488
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,076
Yeah, I served you pigeon, okay?

489
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:28,011
I'm not going to spend my money
on a pheasant when I can get a

490
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,346
perfectly good street bird.

491
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,214
All right, you ate pigeon...

492
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:32,449
Oh, my God!

493
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,583
Jesus Christ, Charlie.

494
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:34,584
Screw it.

495
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:35,452
Tell him I'm not crazy.

496
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,154
You are... you know
what, I don't care.

497
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:38,855
I'm going to get my stomach pumped.

498
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,177
Lady, you got to finish this, okay?
Give us answers now.

499
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,762
Well, I think we've made
some great steps today.

500
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:47,833
Dishes!

501
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,200
- What?
- Dishes.

502
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:54,104
- There is much more at play
here than just... - Dishes!

503
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,974
So you want me to just tell you who...
Dishes.

504
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:57,774
Dishes.

505
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:01,544
On a severe dysfunctional...
Dishes, dishes,

506
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:09,718
dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes, dishes,
dishes, dishes... Okay, okay!

507
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,314
Dee, do the  dishes.

508
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:12,372
Boom!

509
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:15,209
Blah!

510
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:17,311
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

511
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:18,278
You're a good therapist.

512
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,246
She is pretty good.

513
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:20,347
That's good.

514
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:22,984
You goddamn dirty...
Oh, I got an idea.

515
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:24,877
I'll do the dishes, okay?

516
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:26,398
Oh, there's the dishes.

517
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,499
Guys like that?

518
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:28,434
Are you happy now?

519
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,335
Here's some dishes.

520
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,469
You screwed me, you bitch.

521
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:33,639
There's the dishes, all
really nice and clean.

522
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:34,640
Good idea.

523
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,185
Dee, do the dishes.

524
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,058
Here, I got it, I got it. Do I need help?

525
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:42,183
No, sit tight, please, have a beer.
I'll do the dishes.

526
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:45,021
I got it, please, help yourself
to the desert.

527
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,955
It's in the refrigerator.

528
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:51,244
You like this, huh?
Here's the dishes.
