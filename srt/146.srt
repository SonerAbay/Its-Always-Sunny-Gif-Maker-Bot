1
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,854
Okay, now put your arms back.

2
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,923
You're like a...
you're like a rocket ship, okay?

3
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:07,092
Now left.

4
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:09,594
Now right. Now left.
Now right. Now go lower.

5
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,696
- Oh, come on. Come...
- Can you guys go lower?

6
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,598
Dennis, is this really necessary?

7
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,866
Mac, you have
the tendon dexterity of a sow,

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,103
so yes, it's necessary.
Guys, we're about to embark

9
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:20,905
on the most important 24
hours of our lives here.

10
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,007
Okay, it's important
to stay limber and loose.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,409
Uh, yes. Very good, Charlie.

12
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,911
- Can we just start?
- No, we can't just start, okay?

13
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:28,779
Preparation is the key to victory.

14
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:30,415
- Oh.
- Yes, Charlie.

15
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:31,649
You're really nailing this today.

16
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,017
I got my eye on you. Okay.

17
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,353
Now, does everybody know
what they're supposed to do?

18
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,755
Yes. Dennis, I know exactly
what you told us to do.

19
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:39,357
I've memorized it. I know where to be

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,891
and when to be at all times.

21
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:42,293
Okay, good. Yeah.

22
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:43,761
Needy and desperate for approval,

23
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,430
but, uh, good. Charlie.

24
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,131
Now look at that. You see that?

25
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,567
With one little gesture,
he tells me everything I need to know.

26
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,736
That wordless display of
confidence earns my confidence.

27
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,371
Don't. I did it already.

28
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:54,605
You're so desperate.

29
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,941
- I thought it was cool.
- Okay, now, listen. Guys, guys.

30
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,310
We have exactly one
day to pull this off,

31
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:02,247
so everything needs to be
executed to absolute perfection.

32
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:06,284
And, gentlemen, if we do that,
well, the world is our oyster.

33
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,018
Don't say "oyster." Say "clam."

34
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:10,155
- The world's our clam?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:11,822
- I like clams better.
- You like clams? Well,

36
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,824
- that doesn't sound very good.
- They're both shellfish,

37
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:15,826
- so it's kind of the same, isn't it?
- Yeah. One's disgusting,

38
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,196
- and one's delicious.
- Yeah, okay.

39
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,165
- I personally prefer barnacles. You know what I mean?
- Oh.

40
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:21,466
- Yeah, there's some meat in there.
- I like abalone.

41
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:22,467
- Well, okay, guys.
- Abalone's interesting.

42
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,034
- I'm a clam person.
- Seagulls...

43
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:25,170
- Oh, mussels. What about mussels?
- All right, guys.

44
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,172
Let's not get into a whole thing.
We're getting derailed, okay? Uh...

45
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:28,506
We can spend the whole day talking

46
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,508
about which shell creatures
we do or don't prefer

47
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:31,842
or enjoy at any given moment.

48
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:33,110
That's not what we're doing here.

49
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,545
Okay, look, we put in the work.

50
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:37,548
Right? We're ready.
We've done our dry run.

51
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:38,983
And if we put our minds to it,

52
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,187
nothing, absolutely nothing
can stand in our way.

53
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:43,988
- World is our clam.
- Bring it in, boys. - DEE: Oh!

54
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,023
♪ Uh, Dee is in the house ♪

55
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:48,058
♪ Uh, Dee is in the house,
uh, Dee is in the house ♪

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,694
♪ Uh, Dee is in the house. ♪

57
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:50,861
- First things first, we got to ditch Dee.
- Oh, shit.

58
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:51,862
- Yeah, let's ditch her.
- Guys,

59
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:54,031
I am so excited to get started.

60
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,366
Get started on what?

61
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,668
Oh, my God. You forgot.

62
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:00,171
Oh, that makes it so much better.

63
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,506
Oh, guys.

64
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,041
From noon today until noon tomorrow,

65
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,710
it's Dee Day.

66
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,011
- What?
- Oh, my God.

67
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,145
- No. - I completely forgot.
- Oh, shit.

68
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,314
- No, I...
- No, wait, wait, wait.

69
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:11,015
I know, I know.
See, we did all your days,

70
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,350
and now it's my turn.

71
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,252
So that means, for the next 24 hours,

72
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:16,086
you got to do everything
I tell you to do,

73
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:17,422
and you got to listen to me.

74
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:19,757
And you can't complain,
otherwise you're gonna get

75
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:20,886
one of these.

76
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:23,428
And I tack another day on.

77
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:25,196
- Dee, please, please don't do this to us.
- Oh, you better

78
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,097
cram your insults in
now while you got...

79
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:28,766
oh, few more seconds left, guys.

80
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,000
You...

81
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,245
Dee's a bird!

82
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,038
- Dee Day begins in three...
- Dee's a bird! You're a bird!

83
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,406
- ...two... - You're a bird!
- I hate you, bird!

84
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,541
- You're a stupid...!
- ...one.

85
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,512
_

86
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,035
As we all know, you guys
just love to talk and talk about

87
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:08,105
why men this and why God that
and on and on and on and on.

88
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:10,775
And I-I can't even begin
to count the number

89
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,110
of pointless monologues I've
been forced to sit through.

90
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,179
But not today. Today, it's you

91
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:17,315
who will be forced to
sit and just listen.

92
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:18,983
And my first topic?

93
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,085
My feelings.

94
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:22,753
- That's fair. - Yeah, I'm into it.
- Thank you.

95
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,088
- I'm excited.
- Thought you would be.

96
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:25,823
Now, when I wake up
in the morning, I feel sad.

97
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:27,292
And I feel sad for a very long...

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,769
Today of all days,

99
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,328
and now I'm being forced
to listen to her feelings?

100
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:32,663
I won't do it. And who cares
about her feelings anyway?

101
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:34,064
Nobody, that's who.

102
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,667
What about my feelings?
Now, that's interesting, okay?

103
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,769
Plus, the plan.
We can't afford to waste a second,

104
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,705
and these pea-brains are
probably forgetting their parts

105
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,807
with every second that passes by.

106
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,209
Uh-oh.
I'm forgetting my part of the plan

107
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,811
with every second that goes by.

108
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:48,513
Dennis is gonna yell at me again.

109
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,015
Hey, why was Charlie
outshining me earlier?

110
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:52,350
I mean, what's that all about?

111
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,285
It's like he wants
something from Dennis.

112
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:55,620
But what?

113
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,822
Attention? Love?

114
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,924
Why'd he throw me that look?
Does he want to replace me?

115
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,093
Is that what's going on?
What the hell does he want?

116
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:04,695
I'm pretty sure Dennis has candy.

117
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,331
I heard a crinkle in his pocket

118
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,433
that sounded like the
wrapper of a candy.

119
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,167
I gave Mac a look to let him know

120
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,202
that I figured out Dennis has candy.

121
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:14,204
Hopefully, if we nail this plan,

122
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,106
he'll give us some candy.

123
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:18,175
I want that candy.

124
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,844
You know who eats raw shellfish?

125
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,546
Seagulls, that's who.

126
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:23,714
Clams you bake. Clams you fry.

127
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,517
Pop a rubber band around them,
stuff them full of bread,

128
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,553
boil them shits for an hour.

129
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:31,522
There's a million ways
you can prepare a clam.

130
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:34,058
"Make the world your clam."

131
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:36,193
Just sounds better.

132
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:37,662
And that, I believe, is the reason

133
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,497
for all of this toxic masculinity.

134
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,499
- Would you agree?
- Huh?

135
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,000
- Yes. - Yeah. Well...
- A-Absolutely.

136
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,535
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah. Everything... - Absolutely.

137
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,170
Everything you were saying,
we were totally listening.

138
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,505
- That's totally true.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,074
Okay, cool.
Um, I'm gonna go take a quick squirt

140
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:51,509
'cause that beer just
went right through me,

141
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,243
and then we'll move
on to the next thing.

142
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:54,579
- Thanks, Dee.
- Sounds fun. - All right, Dee.

143
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,880
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah, Dee, this is gonna be great.

144
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,181
- I'm looking forward to it.
- This is really cool.

145
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,516
- So excited. So excited.
- I'm enjoying this a lot.

146
00:04:58,616 --> 00:04:59,684
Goddamn bird!

147
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,085
- I'm gonna...
- Where's the scream pillow?

148
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:02,387
Yeah, yeah. No, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

149
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,221
Guys, wait.
We can still pull this thing off.

150
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:05,322
We can still pull this thing off.

151
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:06,657
I-I just came up with another plan.

152
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:08,092
It was actually based
on what Dee just did.

153
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:11,095
She just went to the bathroom.
See, everybody's got to take a dump

154
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,997
at least once in every 24-hour period.

155
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,500
This got me thinking, right?
So, at some point today,

156
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,902
each and every one of us will
have to take a shit, right?

157
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:20,638
We're gonna have to go find a bathroom,
and at that point,

158
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,207
you will go and execute
your part of the plan.

159
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:24,742
- Sounds good. That's good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:26,010
- See what I'm saying? All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

161
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:27,412
So, Charlie, now it is time

162
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:29,547
- for you to take your shit.
- Is there time?

163
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,081
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, great. Nice.

164
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,150
And then, Charlie, go poop,
and then we'll get started.

165
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,719
What? No, that's not
what he's talking about, Mac.

166
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,086
What he means is that it's time for me

167
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:37,422
to go to the school, break in

168
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:39,223
using my old janitor's key, right?

169
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:40,491
Go into the nurse's office,

170
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,926
'cause he's probably
still on his lunch break.

171
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,227
Make the call. Call the valet.

172
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:44,729
Let him know that his kid's "sick"

173
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,197
and needs to be
"picked up from school" ASAP.

174
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:48,566
My man. With that kind of focus,

175
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,200
we're gonna be able to
pull this thing off.

176
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,936
- Yes! - Way to go.
- Yeah! And then when he's there,

177
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:53,504
- that's when he poops.
- Wrong!

178
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,372
- Totally wrong. Just go, Charlie. Go.
- Okay.

179
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,941
A-And keep this kind
of good focus in mind

180
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,375
when it comes to what's
inside your pants,

181
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,844
'cause I want that, man.

182
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,746
Okay. Yeah. All right, great.

183
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,014
- I want what's in your pants.
- No, no.

184
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:05,082
All right.

185
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:07,251
Okay. Where's Charlie?

186
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:08,819
He had to take a shit.

187
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,455
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

188
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,490
- And I, too, have to take a shit now, as well.
- Oh, what?

189
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,691
No. What, now? No.

190
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,626
Well, make up your mind,
or I-I do the horn.

191
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,595
- Okay. It is a bit of an emergency.
- No, it isn't.

192
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,430
He... You can, you can hold it.
He's gonna hold it.

193
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:23,834
Knock, knock, knock.
Hey! How you doing, old Terry?

194
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,269
Old buddy, old pal!

195
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,805
Do I know you?

196
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,140
Ah, come on, it's me!
It's Charlie! Remember?

197
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:32,477
I used to be the janitor
here a few years back.

198
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,679
Yeah, well, I got fired
on account of a relationship

199
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,647
I was having with a Juggalo child,
you know.

200
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,382
That's not the point.
The point is though

201
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,017
I got my old job back.

202
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,352
I'm ready to have new
relationships with the children.

203
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,789
And in case you're wondering
how I got in the building,

204
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,491
that's how.

205
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,159
Oh.

206
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:50,495
Right.

207
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:51,962
And if memory serves,

208
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,031
you usually take your
lunch break about now.

209
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,166
So how about you pop on out,
eat some lunch,

210
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,668
and I'll clean up your office.

211
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,837
Oh, uh, I ate already.

212
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,105
Did you?

213
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,707
Lunch is at noon. It's 12:30.

214
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,341
Oh, yeah. Look at that there.

215
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,544
You know what happened though,
Terry, was I got a little

216
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,513
held up on account of it
being Dee Day and all.

217
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,848
- It's not D-Day.
- You know what?

218
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,683
Actually, Terry, I should tell you this.

219
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:15,853
Um, I saw some kids breaking
in to your car outside.

220
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:17,021
I ride a bike.

221
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:18,355
Yeah. That's what I meant.

222
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,190
They were breaking on
in to your bicycle.

223
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,527
Kicked it in half.
Filled it with horse manure.

224
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,029
- Kind of a prank, I guess.
- Yeah, I don't believe you.

225
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:27,464
Well, only one way to find out.
Better pop outside, take a peek.

226
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,036
My bike is fine.

227
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,571
One step ahead of me, aren't you, Terry?

228
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:35,005
Okay, you know what happened?

229
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:37,007
Dee Day just threw everything off, okay?

230
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,843
So I'm just gonna slide on in here.

231
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,377
Maybe I'm gonna make
a little phone call.

232
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:42,680
No big deal.
And I'm not gonna make a phone call.

233
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,682
I'll just have some candy, then.

234
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:48,418
And I'm not gonna have any candy
'cause candy's for the kids.

235
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,021
Terry, this has been
an unfortunate, uh...

236
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:53,390
Hey, can I use your phone
and pretend to be you?

237
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,692
No.

238
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,027
Okay. That's strike three
on my, uh, count.

239
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,863
Uh, I'm gonna fuck your bike up, Terry.

240
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,338
- What the hell is this?
- Charlie, you would not

241
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:10,474
- believe what we're doing.
- Oh, my God. What is that?

242
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:13,010
Ladies just doing
it for themselves. I'm just playing.

243
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,545
- I'm Martina Martinez.
- Oh, no.

244
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:16,681
You don't have to do the accent anymore,
Frank. You're offstage.

245
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:19,016
- Oh, my God. This is so racist, right?
- It's insanely racist.

246
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:21,752
We didn't want to do it, but you know,
Dee's humor is so lowbrow.

247
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:23,020
Oh, my God. What is she...?

248
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,689
Uh, she wants to do
a whole retrospective

249
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,056
of her stupid characters.

250
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,391
- Wrote a play about it.
- Her characters suck!

251
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:28,525
- I know!
- Her characters suck!

252
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:29,994
Charlie, thank God you're here.

253
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:31,395
- Go get into costume. We're up next.
- Dennis.

254
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:32,663
Oh, Dennis, uh, you're offstage,

255
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:33,864
so y-you don't have to
do the accent anymore.

256
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,265
That's why you suck
at everything, Maxie.

257
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,067
I say if you're gonna
do a racist stereotype,

258
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:39,369
you best do it right.
I mean, that's a bit much, but you know.

259
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:41,405
- Oh, uh, where are we with the phone call?
- Uh, no.

260
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,040
I wasn't able to make it.
I was not able to make the call, guys.

261
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,508
- What?!
- I'm sorry. Okay, look.

262
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,510
Here's what we'll do.
I'll-I'll go to the valet myself, okay?

263
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,212
I'll go to the restaurant.
I'll get the key.

264
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:49,914
I-I can make it work, Dennis, all right?
Don't get mad.

265
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,750
- Who's desperate now, Charlie?
- Shut up, Mac, you racist!

266
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,952
I'm not racist! She's racist!
She's the one that's racist!

267
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:56,320
- She's making us do it.
- Hey, turkeys! - Shh. Shh.

268
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,922
- What's the holdup in there?
- No, no, no, no. Goddamn it.

269
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:59,724
Look, uh, you stay here, Charlie.

270
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,559
Um, Mac, Frank, you go down there, okay?

271
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,461
Um,
you're not on again till the second act.

272
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,496
- I won't let you down, Dennis.
- Great. Go, go, go.

273
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,998
- Go.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

274
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,900
- Oh, man.
- Charlie. Charlie, go get into your costume.

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,736
- We got to learn a song.
- What? A song?

276
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,707
God.

277
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,042
The glue on these teeth is insane.

278
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,310
I would never be able to
get them off and on in time.

279
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,312
Ah, this makeup is making me sick.

280
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:25,049
- I'm... I feel awful.
- It's not the makeup, Frank.

281
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,685
It's the bag of clams you made
us stop before we came here.

282
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:28,793
The clam is fine.

283
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,220
If w-we got a bag of oysters,

284
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,256
those would've made us really sick.

285
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:33,624
Whatever, dude. Just focus, all right?

286
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,159
The councilwoman's gonna
be here any second.

287
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,161
Yeah, well, what do we got to do now?

288
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,829
Charlie screwed up the
whole thing with the valet.

289
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:40,497
Now how are we gonna get her keys?

290
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,166
- All right, well, I got a plan.
- What?

291
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,501
Now, when the valet
gets into the next car,

292
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:45,836
I want you to go to your car,

293
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,537
and I want you to ram him, all right?

294
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,674
Nothing crazy, but
it's got to be believable, all right?

295
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,475
Then, I'll step in as the valet.

296
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,143
I'll get the councilwoman's keys.

297
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,880
I'll go get a copy made.
I'll be back here ASAP.

298
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,848
I have, I have a suggestion.
I mean, if you want...

299
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:59,650
if you want it to be
really believable...

300
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,352
the car accident...
then I think you should do it.

301
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:06,691
I mean, I'm not saying out
loud why you should be the one

302
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:11,028
to have the car accident,
but I think it would play much better.

303
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:12,296
I do appreciate that you're working

304
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:13,831
on your prejudices, Frank.
I, too, am trying

305
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,565
to become a better man and...
but I just...

306
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,934
I-I-I really think that, unfortunately,

307
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,703
- it is a better plan.
- It's a good plan.

308
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:20,805
So, uh, I'm just gonna
go ahead and do that.

309
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,172
Oh! Oh!

310
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,841
Okay. Okay, he's coming. Oh, good.

311
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,043
- You go get the keys. I'm gonna go do the acc...
- Okay.

312
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,046
- Are you okay?
- I'm-I'm... I'm just so sick.

313
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,696
This makeup is making me...

314
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,317
Okay.

315
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:43,994
Hello there. I'm the valet.

316
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:45,207
I'll take your car.

317
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,497
- Oh, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

318
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:50,234
I'm-I'm... I'm fine.
I'm aces. It's just...

319
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,037
It's just that I got a
little skin thing going on.

320
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,505
But I-I... I may get sick,
but it won't be clams.

321
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:58,342
It won't be the clams,
because if it was clams...

322
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,178
...clams and I was sick,
it would be all over the pavement.

323
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:02,880
Uh, uh, I'm sorry,
but is there someone else

324
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,381
- that can take my car from me?
- No. No.

325
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,383
- He's gone. He had a car accident.
- An accident?

326
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:07,985
- Oh, my God. Oh, geez.
- Yeah.

327
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,054
- Oh. Oh.
- Yeah, there it is.

328
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,688
- That was it. Yeah.
- God. Um...

329
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,226
- It's not the clams!
- Oh! Uh, yeah.

330
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,395
I'm telling you, it can't be the clams!

331
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,731
It don't make no sense! No, don't go.

332
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,303

cool with this, 'cause, like,

that's where society's headed,
but I'm just... I'm not there.

366
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,531
- I'm not saying it's not right.
- I'm not ready. I'm not ready.

367
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm saying I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.

368
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,501
What did you eat?
Why am I getting a weird taste...

369
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,603
I had cheese. I thought...
Well, I wanted...

370
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,038
Well, now you know how it feels.

371
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,673
Oh, I don't want to taste your cheese.
It's weird...

372
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:10,908
Well, I didn't want to taste
your cheese, either.

373
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,179
- Hey. How'd it go with the valet?
- We, uh, we struck out.

374
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,314
- You what?! - No good...
- Well, how are we gonna get

375
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:18,382
in the woman's apartment
without her key?

376
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:19,583
We got to get in that apartment.

377
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:21,018
We got to set that woman's clocks back.

378
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,686
- What's going on with him?
- Clams.

379
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,354
- Where'd you get clams?
- Did you eat bad clams, Frank?

380
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,523
- No, don't.
- Hey, guys. Ticktock back there!

381
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,858
All right,
just go finish the goddamn show.

382
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,593
- Yeah, by the way, she made us kiss.
- Yeah.

383
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,361
- She made us kiss.
- I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that.

384
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,429
All right, let's just get out there.

385
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,864
I don't want to be doing this all week.

386
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:36,233
- Hey, you guys really did kiss?
- Yeah, but don't get excited.

387
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,667
- That's not fair.
- But we didn't like it.

388
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,069
- Just go.
- Dennis, you should come out with us.

389
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:40,370
- No, no, no.
- Get out! Just go and finish the show.

390
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,073
- Finish the show, all right?
- I'm not kissing you.

391
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:44,231
Okay.

392
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,411
So, in this scene,
Martina enters Tammy's massage parlor

393
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,413
looking for a full-body rubdown.

394
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:51,415
- What?!
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

395
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,017
And like all great plays,

396
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:55,552
this one is going to
have a happy ending.

397
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:59,023
Yeah, that was clams.

398
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:05,495
Oh, nothing like a day of bird-watching.

399
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,697
So peaceful. So relaxing.

400
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,699
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Huh? Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

401
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,035
- Really calming.
- And, yeah, it's, uh...

402
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,736
- It's great.
- Birds are m-majestical.

403
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:14,171
Ooh, fun bird fact.

404
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:16,706
The ostrich's eyes are
bigger than its brain.

405
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,043
- Huh.
- Do you have any thoughts on that?

406
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:20,710
- That's... cool.
- Good.

407
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:23,247
- Great bird. - It's a good bird.
- Ostriches are good birds.

408
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:25,682
Well, unfortunately,
I have to take another piss.

409
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,051
- I'll be back.
- Okay. - Okay.

410
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,452
See ya, Dee. We're just gonna look at...

411
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:29,753
look for some more birds that we love.

412
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,121
- Yeah, we'll keep on, uh...
- Yeah, just gonna...

413
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:34,024
Oh, my God, I want to scream "bird,"
I want to scream "bird."

414
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:35,692
- I want to scream, "Bird! Bird!"
- That would be so good.

415
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,427
- Do you want me to do it for you, Dennis?
- No.

416
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,263
Don't do it.
She's probably hiding behind a tree.

417
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:40,864
Yeah. What's going on with you?

418
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:42,566
Why are you so off your game today?

419
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,568
Well, I... Charlie
has been outshining me all day,

420
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,803
and I want to shine for you,
Dennis, so I'm just...

421
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,472
I haven't been outshining you.
I was just throwing you looks

422
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,075
because I wanted the candy,
but I was gonna share it with you.

423
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:53,710
- What candy?
- Dennis has candy in his pocket.

424
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,327
Okay, guys, can we get back
to talking about the plan?

425
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:57,147
- You have candy?
- Look, w-we're getting off track here.

426
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:58,582
- Dennis has candy?
- I heard it crinkle.

427
00:14:58,682 --> 00:14:59,950
- Yeah, I want that candy, man.
- Yes, I have candy.

428
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,651
All right? Of course I have candy.

429
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,187
I keep candy in my pocket sometimes

430
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:04,721
so that I can get Charlie's focus.

431
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:05,922
It was working like a charm, man.

432
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:07,857
I was zoned in on
everything you were saying.

433
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,960
Yes, I know it was working;
the whole goddamn thing was working

434
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,262
till Dee came through with
this Dee Day bullshit.

435
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,364
Are we gonna get the candy,
or are you gonna keep it

436
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:16,466
- in your pocket all day?
- I'll have some candy. - Here's the candy.

437
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,168
- Yeah! Yes, I knew it.
- Oh, oh, oh! I want...

438
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:19,169
All right, all right.

439
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,338
- Wow.
- Children. Children.

440
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:23,673
- Good candy, good candy.
- This is good candy.

441
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:24,841
I don't need the candy anymore anyway,

442
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,010
'cause I have a backup plan.

443
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,711
We don't need the
councilwoman's keys anymore

444
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:29,813
to get into her house,
because we have me. All right?

445
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,481
So I'll peel off. I'll go seduce her.

446
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,183
She'll invite me into her house,

447
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,685
where I'll bang her as fast
as I possibly can, and then,

448
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,954
while she's cleaning up afterwards,
I'll set all of her clocks back,

449
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,224
causing her to sleep late
and miss the boat, okay?

450
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:41,691
So when Dee comes back, just tell her

451
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,028
- I had to go take my shit.
- Nice, man. All right.

452
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,529
- Watch out!
- Hey.

453
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:47,831
- Hey.
- Where you rushing off to?

454
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,866
- Oh, I-I got to take a shit.
- Do ya?

455
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,535
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'll let you do that.

456
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,170
- Okay.
- But real quick first.

457
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,804
I wanted to do something with you.

458
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:57,641
- I really have to shit, Dee.
- Yeah, this'll be fast.

459
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:59,543
- What is that?
- Oh, these are makeup wipes.

460
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,378
So that you can remove your makeup.

461
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,380
Makeup?

462
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,015
I'm not wearing any makeup.

463
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,683
Then it won't be an issue.

464
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,154
I mean, I'm wearing
a little bit of concealer.

465
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:11,888
Is that what you're talking
about having me remove?

466
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,223
Well, I'm talking
about the concealer, yes.

467
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,824
But I'm talking about
the rest of the makeup,

468
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,660
the tape you have behind
your jaw and your eyes.

469
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:17,727
I'm talking about the hair paint.

470
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:19,029
I'm talking about all of it.

471
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,570
What a nice restaurant this is,

472
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,206
filled with attractive,
professional-looking people.

473
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:31,508
You know what it is?
It's the kind of place

474
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,844
where you wouldn't want to
stick out like a sore thumb.

475
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:36,546
How are you liking it, Dennis?

476
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,349
Yes, very nice.

477
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,850
- Yeah?
- Yes.

478
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,553
Would you like to go introduce
yourself to some ladies?

479
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:46,223
No, uh, I-I'm okay. Uh, no.

480
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,425
Okay. I'll go round some
up and bring them to you.

481
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,659
- No.
- Yep.

482
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,561
Hey, don't mind her, dude.

483
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:52,696
Y-You look great.

484
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:55,732
Holy shit. That's her.

485
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,567
- Who?
- The councilwoman.

486
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,902
- She's right there.
- Who? Right there?

487
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:00,570
- Right there. That's her.
- Right there? Oh, shit.

488
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,872
- Oh, my God, this is incredible. What are the odds?
- That's her, yeah.

489
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,541
Dee has no idea how good this is for us.

490
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,543
- Dennis, go do your thing.
- This is great.

491
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,545
No, I-I...

492
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,214
- I can't. No.
- Buddy,

493
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:12,015
makeup or not, you are the Golden God.

494
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,583
It's all about what's in here.

495
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh. Is your pec deflated?

496
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,554
Sh-She took his pads out.

497
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,123
- Yeah, he had...
- Oh, your pec pads.

498
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,325
- He had some pads.
- No.

499
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:24,128
Well, either way, man, you can do it.
You're our only hope.

500
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,362
- I can do this.
- Yes. - Yeah.

501
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,963
- Yeah, it's worth a shot.
- Yeah!

502
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,465
- That's the attitude. - Come on, man.
- You're looking good.

503
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,267
You got it. You got this. You got this.

504
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,236
- You got this. You got this.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

505
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:34,604
- He ain't got this.
- That's what his soul looks like.

506
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:46,983
Hi.

507
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:49,018
Did I frighten you?

508
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,687
Sorry.

509
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:53,757
Uh, I'm not, I'm not, uh... I'm Dennis.

510
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,762
Do you like hard candy?

511
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:01,398
I have candies. Oh, you know what?

512
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,933
Actually, I don't. Scratch that. I...

513
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:07,337
I threw all the hard candies
at those idiot children.

514
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,206
Uh...

515
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:11,040
Oysters or clams?

516
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,843
- Excuse me?
- Oysters, obviously.

517
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:16,446
You know?

518
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,682
- Mm.
- Plus, like, they-they...

519
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,284
You can, you can get sick off clams.

520
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,286
Like, I got real sick off
clams when I was, like...

521
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,021
Anything can make you throw up

522
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,557
if you're, if you're, uh...
if it's gone bad.

523
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,526
You know, my dad was,
like, throwing up off...

524
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,361
He's not really my dad, but you know.

525
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,363
Yeah.

526
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:35,463
But anyway, it's oysters for me.

527
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,123
Um...

528
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,535
Hey, uh, you know what? I just realized.

529
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,237
We don't have a lot of time, so let's...

530
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,472
We should get this over with.
Can I get your house key?

531
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:43,673
- What?
- We don't,

532
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,475
uh, have to have sex like this.

533
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:48,044
I can, I can...
I can put another man's face on.

534
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:50,380
If you give me your house key,
I can go to your house

535
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,681
and put on some of your makeup...

536
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,517
- Get away from me.
- Well, hold on a second.

537
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,420
Um, uh, we... I'm supposed to
be taking a shit right now.

538
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,222
- And so... Yeah.
- Dennis.

539
00:18:58,322 --> 00:18:59,856
What are you doing to this woman?

540
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,525
Uh, it was my turn to take a shit,

541
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,027
and then I was gonna do it with her.

542
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,729
I am so sorry about him. Okay?

543
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,197
This man is clearly a monster,

544
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,665
and he will be punished accordingly.

545
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,166
G-Go wait for me over there, monster.

546
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,335
We'll find another woman.

547
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:13,837
It's Dee Day.

548
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:18,408
Just so you know, you look...

549
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:21,211
a lot better now, but you looked fine.

550
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,513
I just don't look good when
I haven't got enough sleep.

551
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:25,749
And I got a little nap in,
so, you know, I'm back.

552
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:27,317
- Huh.
- Anyway,

553
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:29,419
I bet you the city
council's voted already.

554
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,488
- Dying to figure out which way they voted.
- Oh, dude.

555
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,490
It doesn't matter.
Like, the bird bitch ruined everything.

556
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,825
- We had a plan. We had...
- Shh. Keep your voice down.

557
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,927
We may have lost this one,
but the most important thing

558
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,829
is that we don't get another Dee Day.

559
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:42,732
Oh, man. That's, like,
the 20th piss I took today.

560
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,200
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, hey, it's important

561
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,769
- to stay hydrated.
- Yeah.

562
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,871
Knock it off. Looks like
you guys are gonna make it.

563
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:50,740
And I have to say,
I am very impressed that you were able

564
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,843
to focus on anything other than
yourselves for one entire day.

565
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:55,845
- Well, Dee, it's been a real pleasure.
- Uh, we haven't

566
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,914
- made it yet, so... - We've enjoyed it.
- It's been really great.

567
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,384
And Dee Day ends officially in

568
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:03,219
three, two, one.

569
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,390
All right, let me have it.
Pile it on me.

570
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:08,358
- News. - Pile it on me.
- TV. TV. Yeah, put the...

571
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,026
- Channel 7. Channel 7.
- Put the news on. Put the news on.

572
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,361
- What are you doing?
- What channel? What channel?

573
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:12,762
- S-Seven? Seven?
- Yeah, it might be.

574
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,764
In a stunning upset,

575
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:17,801
local ordinance LC-103 passed today.

576
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,469
The controversial proposal

577
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:22,872
actually legalizes public urination.

578
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,608
- It passed! It passed!
- It passed! It passed!

579
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,709
It passed!

580
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:27,377
Oh!

581
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,778
- It passed anyway.
- Nice!

582
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:29,979
What passed?

583
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,715
Dee, we have been working for weeks

584
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,049
on a very intricate plan

585
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,451
to ensure the passage of that ordinance.

586
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,320
Yeah. All we had to do was
stop one city councilwoman

587
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:37,921
- from voting, that was it.
- Yeah, yeah. So we had

588
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,756
this ingenious plan to,
uh, get ahold of her keys,

589
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,525
sneak into her house and, uh,
turn all of her clocks back,

590
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,593
- mess with her phones a little bit or whatever...
- It was a good plan.

591
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:45,662
...so that she would sleep too late,
she would miss the vote,

592
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,673
and the ordinance would pass,
and it passed!

593
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,300
We knew that she would be
the one dissenting vote.

594
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,435
- So we had to stop her.
- Yeah.

595
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:52,869
- How?
- Oh, well, it's a group...

596
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,504
- Uh, well, yeah.
- There it is.

597
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:56,139
It's all men and she was the one lady.

598
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,707
- Men are free once again...
- We are free!

599
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:00,009
...to relieve themselves
where God intended.

600
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:01,311
You guys are idiots!

601
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,179
That's the most ludicrous
thing I've ever even heard.

602
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,181
Why didn't you just go
and slash her tires, like,

603
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,016
five minutes before she had
to leave for the meeting?

604
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:08,785
- Oh. Oh.
- What? Oh, yeah, just do that.

605
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,354
- Okay, yeah, just do that.
- Yeah, sure.

606
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,155
Dee, you know what?
You don't get it. Okay?

607
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,358
Women will never understand
what it's like to be a man.

608
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,060
Like, we just, like,
we need to piss in public, okay?

609
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,397
We need to hatch plans
that actually work.

610
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,699
Dee, your plan would not have worked.

611
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:25,502
Oh, yeah? My plan did work, jackass.

612
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,737
I got close enough to the
councilwoman in the restaurant

613
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,739
to steal her wallet, got her address,

614
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,541
and then replaced the
wallet without her seeing.

615
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,142
And then, in the middle of the night

616
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:35,311
when I told you guys
I was going to "take a shit"

617
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,313
like you were doing all goddamn day,

618
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:39,683
I snuck over and I slashed her tires.

619
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,318
You did? Why?

620
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:44,187
Did you see how many times I peed today?

621
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,589
I have a teeny, tiny, little bladder.

622
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:47,824
I want to be able to pee
on the street if I have to.

623
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:49,726
- Oh! You? - Ugh! Gross.
- In front of us?

624
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:51,361
- Just out there in the public?
- A woman? - Squat?

625
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:52,696
- Dee, you nasty.
- Nasty.

626
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:55,064
- Dee, you n...
- She's so nasty.

627
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,200
No, you know what?
You guys are just pissed

628
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,403
- because I outsmarted you.
- Oh, you outsmarted us?

629
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,738
- You're embarrassed.
- Dee, you spent the entirety of Dee Day

630
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,607
coming up with a plan
that eventually led

631
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:06,042
to us getting exactly
what we want, so...

632
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:07,677
- We scored.
- You're a stupid bird.

633
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:09,379
Don't even bother trying
to explain it to her.

634
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,014
Her tiny bird brain will never get it.

635
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,449
Birds don't understand plans.

636
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:13,550
What about this one? Dee's a bird.

637
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:15,852
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

638
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:17,353
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh.

639
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,423
You should all probably
check your phones.

640
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:21,157
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

641
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,060
Just 'cause I pushed the
cuckoo clock ahead an hour.

642
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:27,263
No. Shut up.

643
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,232
Here's the problem, guys.

644
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:33,202
You just insulted me on Dee Day.

645
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:35,204
- No. - No, no, no, no. God.
- Oh, no, wait...

646
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,873
You know what that earns you?

647
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,341
Another day of Dee.

648
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:39,876
- Oh, no!
- No, no, no, no, no!
