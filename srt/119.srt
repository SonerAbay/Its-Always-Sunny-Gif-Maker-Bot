1
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,377
Oh, where am I? Oh.

2
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:21,279
Oh.

3
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:22,980
Where am I?

4
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,483
Oy, I made it home.

5
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,385
Oh, God.

6
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:29,053
Oh. Oh.

7
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:30,788
Ah.

8
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,890
I don't know.
Where am I supposed to be?

9
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,859
Oh, shit, look.

10
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,794
Fuck. Okay.

11
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:40,665
Get up.

12
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,333
Oh, I drank too much.

13
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:45,303
Ooh, got to piss.
Got to piss. Got to pee.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,071
Where's the toilet?
Where's the toilet?

15
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,639
Ah, there it is.

16
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,975
Oh!

17
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:02,820
Ah, Frank.

18
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,956
Pull yourself together,
get to the bar.

00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:26,677
Eh, eh. Eh.

21
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,980
Mm, mm. Mm.

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,082
Still got it.

23
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:39,703
All righty, here we go. See what
we're getting into today.

24
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:41,557
It's only a backup.
You're gonna be fine.

25
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,692
If everybody sticks to the tasks
that I've carefully tailored

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,761
for each of you,
then you're gonna be great.

27
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,062
- Everything's gonna work out.
<i>-  Oh, shit!</i>

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,697
Frank, do you know
what's happening?

29
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,566
<i>Mm, play it cool, play it cool.</i>

30
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,067
Ah, Dennis, I know
what's happening.

31
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:53,969
- Ah!
- My God. -So what?

32
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:56,705
Well, if we were just asking if
everybody knows what's going on,

33
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:58,674
I just want to say that I do.
I wasn't asking.

34
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:00,209
We're not. He didn't.
That's not what's going on.

35
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,910
He didn't ask that.
That's not the thing.

36
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:03,679
I wasn't. All
right, you know what?

37
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:06,048
Let's just... let's go
over the blueprint, okay?

38
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:08,250
Yeah, the blueprint. I want everybody to
map out their positions. Specifically...

39
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,785
<i>All right, here's
your chance to catch up.</i>

40
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,020
<i>Look at the blueprint.</i>
<i>Listen to the vain one.</i>

41
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:14,123
<i>He knows the deal.</i>
<i>What's his name again?</i>

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,592
<i>Is it Damon? No. Delroy.</i>

43
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,562
<i>No. DeMarcus. Why can't I think</i>
<i>of his name today?</i>

44
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,832
<i>Shoot! I think he just</i>
<i>explained the plan!</i>

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,701
So I think we're good.

46
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,070
Yeah. Frank, you ready to run us
all through it again?

47
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,972
<i>Shit. Deflect! Deflect!</i>

48
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,074
Shut up, bird!

49
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:34,910
Don't ask him
to run us back through it.

50
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,478
He knows the plan.
All right, good.

51
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:38,046
So we're good.
Let's-let's do it.

52
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,615
Yeah. Frank.
Let's do it.

53
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,016
<i>Nice save, Frankie.</i>

54
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:42,518
Like, your timing is...

55
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,119
You're so funny every time.

56
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,487
Frank, what? Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,356
Where you going, man?

58
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,691
You got to stay back here on the
walkie in case of an emergency.

59
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,426
Right, yeah, emergency.

60
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,395
Right, okay, and you
have your walkie, right?

61
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,830
<i>No.</i>

62
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:56,632
Yes. Great.
All right.

63
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,167
All right, let's do it.

64
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:00,669
We'll be in touch.

65
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,805
Ah, shit!

66
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:04,907
Got to get home.
Got to get that walkie.

67
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:06,375
Starving.

68
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,377
Oh, what's that?

69
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:10,712
Pondy. Aha!

70
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,347
"Let's party."

71
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:15,784
Ha! Sorry, Pondy. Can't.

72
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,488
Old tits. He's saying I'm old.

73
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:21,523
Goddamn it, Pondy's the coolest.

74
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,293
L... O... M?

75
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,228
Yeah, "M." Stupid phone!

76
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,263
L... O... L.

77
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,169
Ah, shit! Probably Asians.

78
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,371
Oh, walkie, walkie, walkie,
walkie. Where?

79
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,040
Where the hell
did I put that thing?

80
00:03:38,107 --> 00:03:40,142
Where the hell is it? Ah, shit.

81
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,711
I'll get... There it is.
Okay, got it. I'm here.

82
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,780
Keep the line clear, you idiot. Over.

83
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,148
Roger that.

84
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:48,183
Stop talking! Over.

85
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,452
Well, well, well.

86
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,955
Goddamn it!

87
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:54,790
<i>I hate this slimy bastard.</i>

88
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,658
Where's the rent, Frank?

89
00:03:56,726 --> 00:04:00,295
In my pocket where it's gonna
stay until you fix the plumbing.

90
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,264
You're playing games
with me, Frank.

91
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:03,966
I don't like games.

92
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,634
You know what I like?

93
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,402
This sandwich.

94
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,004
It's snake meat.

95
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,472
Snake meat?

96
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,207
Huh. Is that what
you people eat?

97
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,476
Yeah, snake meat.

98
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,546
I hope you choke on that,
and you die, you piece of shit.

99
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:20,015
You slime ball bastard!

100
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,851
<i>Oh. Oh, shit!</i>

101
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,353
<i>He is choking.</i>

102
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,388
You son of a bitch!

103
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,923
Frank?

104
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:30,092
You're dying, you bastard.

105
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,094
Look at me.
You're dying.

106
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,962
Give me that goddamn thing!

107
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,031
Snake meat, huh? Hmm.

108
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,233
Mmm, mmm. Mmm!

109
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,303
Oh, went down the wrong pipe.

110
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:42,905
Now I'm choking.

111
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,909
Light's going out.

112
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't want to die looking
at you, you sack of shit!

113
00:04:51,748 --> 00:04:53,649
Yet! Ooh, shit.

114
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:55,584
I'm checking out.

115
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:59,988
Somebody
throw me in the trash.

116
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,139
<i>Where am I?</i>

117
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,574
<i>Where am I?! Oh!</i>

118
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:22,177
<i>Am I dead? Huh?</i>

119
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,046
<i>Am I in hell?!</i>

120
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:27,683
<i>No.</i>

121
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,052
<i>I died and went to heaven.</i>

122
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,454
<i>Oh, come to Papa.</i>
<i>Let me have 'em.</i>

123
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:34,856
Rest up now.
You're in the hospital.

124
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:36,191
Everything's okay.

125
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:38,593
Mr. Reynolds,
you're a very lucky man.

126
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,295
If it weren't
for that choking fit,

127
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,031
we would have never been able
to run tests, and...

128
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,167
We found something.
You have a very serious disease,

129
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,735
but fortunately,
we caught it just in time...

130
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,370
There's a malignant tumor
on your front lobe...

131
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:51,106
<i>Oh, look at those Winnebagos.</i>

132
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,275
<i>Shaboya roll call!</i>

133
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,844
<i>I would like to take a ride</i>
<i>down the Grand Canyon</i>

134
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,245
<i>in those honeys.</i>

135
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,716
Which sadly means,
we might have to remove it.

136
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,351
- Huh?
- Frank!

137
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:04,786
Frank, come in. Over.
Shit, I got to go.

138
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,355
Sir, sir. You shouldn't be
running anywhere.

139
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:08,323
Your condition may be terminal.
Out of my way!

140
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,559
Wait, please, sir,
whatever you do, don't...

141
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,785
Frank, Frank, come in. Over.

142
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,032
I'm on my way.

143
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,734
Aw, shit. I need a ride.

144
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,036
I'll bet Pondy will pick me up.

145
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,039
Party mobile's here!

146
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,407
Thanks for the ride, Pondy!

147
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,975
Hop in, Frank.

148
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:29,511
Aw, goddamn it,
Pondy's the coolest.

149
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,581
It's official, Frank.
I divorced that cheatin' bitch.

150
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:34,449
Yeah.
I mean, I cheated on her, too.

151
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,284
But who's keeping score, right?

152
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,088
Anywho, I got a nest egg to blow
so that whore can't touch it.

153
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,923
Let's rage!

154
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,959
Hey. Here. Take an aspirin.

155
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,794
<i>That ain't aspirin.</i>

156
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,863
It ain't aspirin.

157
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,832
Does Frankenstein want
to come out and play?

158
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,567
I'm sorry, Pondy.
No drugs for me today.

159
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,370
I need to keep my wits about me.
Lame!

160
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,198
- More for me.
- Yo, Frank!

161
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:59,708
We're outside the bakery on 6th
Street. Where the hell are you?

162
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:02,077
Pondy, I need the car. Solo.

163
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:03,945
Roger dodger.

164
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,581
I'll just drop myself off
at the roller rink, you know?

165
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,583
Get some strange. Hop in, baby.

166
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,686
<i>Pondy is the coolest.</i>

167
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:14,717
♪ Rock you like a hurricane... ♪

168
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:23,179
Oh, look.
Dumb bird got a boot on her car.

169
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,934
You're right! You're right, I'm
wrong, okay?!

170
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:27,421
Get in the car.
God. Where the hell have you been?

171
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,823
Don't blame him.
He's not the one

172
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,324
who got a goddamn boot
on his car.

173
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,726
Whose car is this, anyway?
Ponderosa's.

174
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:35,396
Pondero... Aw, we're all over the place, man!
What?

175
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,898
What are we doing in this car? No, no, no,
no, no. We're good, we're good, okay?

176
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,486
Except why aren't
we moving yet, Frank?

177
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:42,036
All right.

178
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:43,571
Okay. All right. We're good.
Let's huddle up, you guys.

179
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:44,972
Let's review the plan.
<i>Okay, listen.</i>

180
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,440
<i>Pay attention.</i>
So, Frank,

181
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,075
you're on guard dog duty.

182
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,063
Dee, Charlie, and I are
gonna distract the guard.

183
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,746
Mac is tossing the rug over
the barbed wire and sneaking in.

184
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:54,281
Yeah?
<i>I'm still lost.</i>

185
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,116
Uh, one problem.
We're gonna need

186
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,552
- a new rug because I threw it clean over.
- What?

187
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,588
- Oh. Goddamn it!
- Oh, Jesus, dude!

188
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:03,057
How'd this happen? All you had
to do was drape it on the barbed wire

189
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,125
and-and climb over the fence.
I'm too strong.

190
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,394
I'm sorry, Dennis.
"Too strong." Okay, well, you know what,

191
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,422
don't apologize to me.
Apologize to everybody else

192
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,931
that you let down. All right, we
don't have time for apologies.

193
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,499
What's Plan B here?
Does anyone know?

194
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,435
There is no goddamn
Plan B. I don't know.

195
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:16,770
All right, Mac, you got to find
some other way over that fence.

196
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:19,440
We'll go... we'll go distract the guard.
I-I... Yeah, yeah. Let's get

197
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,475
a look at the schedule, maybe? Just
got to figure out Let's go. Come on.

198
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,977
what's going on. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, that's a good idea.

199
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,312
Hey, Frank?

200
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,615
Do you think
that Dennis hates me?

201
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,717
What? I just want him to think
that I'm cool, you know?

202
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,452
And I just feel like...
Is this a little bit lame?

203
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,454
I just feel like I can talk
to you about this kind of stuff.

204
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:34,989
Yeah? Oh, yeah, you
can tell me anything.

205
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,024
Really? Oh, well,

206
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,826
honestly, I just feel like...

207
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>Oh, God, this one creeps me out.</i>

208
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,796
<i>I hate being alone with him.</i>

209
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:45,032
<i>If he touches me, I swear</i>
<i>to God I'm gonna freak out.</i>

210
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,735
...you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah. Totally, totally.

211
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,870
Yeah, okay. Well, look,
if you could just casually,

212
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:52,506
off the cuff, mention
that I can bench-press...

213
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,308
<i>What is that, fudge?</i> ...I
think that he'll respect me.

214
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:55,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude,
what are you doing? Mmm.

215
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:57,745
Those are dog treats laced
with sleeping pills.

216
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,280
Those are for the guard dog.

217
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,848
<i>Tasty.</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep eating it.</i>

218
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,883
Maybe I could just hop
the fence, you know? I mean...

219
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,519
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I know</i>
<i>where there's another rug.</i>

220
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,888
I know where I can get a
rug real quick. What?

221
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:09,523
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, wait, we'll go...

222
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,791
Are you sure you can drive,
dude?

223
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,860
Out of my way, creep.
Aah!

224
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,831
Franklin, thank you for coming.

225
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:20,501
Yeah, I got no time for
swapping loads. I'm in a jam.

226
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:23,137
<i>Whoa, Jews!</i>
What is this?

227
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:25,739
We're sitting shiva,
for my Aunt Joyce.

228
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,474
Come, meet my family.

229
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:30,577
<i>That dog stuff is kicking in.</i>

230
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:31,812
Lisa.

231
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,683
<i>Ooh, hoo. Shabooya roll call.</i>

232
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,685
<i>Aw, shit. There's the rug.</i>

233
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:39,553
<i>Under the buffet table.</i>

234
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,889
Mom, Dad,

235
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,858
this is my part-time
lover, Frank Reynolds.

236
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:46,794
<i>I am starting to feel woozy.</i>

237
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,595
<i>Say something smart.</i>

238
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:51,332
Uh, uh, excuse me,

239
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,701
I'm full of dog poison.

240
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,315
That's not good.
That's not good, Frankie.

241
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,117
What's happening?
What's happening?

242
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,052
What's happening?

243
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,297
Come on. Come on. Frankie.

244
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,503
Hello, Frank.
Artie.

245
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,306
Better go get that rug out
from under that table, Frank.

246
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:34,575
Got to get the-the rug.
I'm getting a rug.

247
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:36,844
What? There are drugs
in the medicine cabinet.

248
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,046
There's drugs
in the medicine cabinet!

249
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:41,382
Uppers, uppers, uppers, uppers.

250
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,285
Jackpot!

251
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:50,457
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

252
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,926
Ooh. Crush it.

253
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:56,230
Crush it, Frankie.
What are you gonna do?

254
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:58,832
Oh, slowin' down.

255
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,534
Need uppers.

256
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,983
It's Frankenstein! Ha!

257
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,654
Frank? Are you okay?
Rug, rug, rug, rug.

258
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,656
Get out of the way, Jew. Out of my way.
What's happening?

259
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,826
Back off. Frank!

260
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,194
What's going on?

261
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:28,562
Rug!
Frank!

262
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,667
Car. Come on. Come on.

263
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,903
Don't get killed,
don't get killed.

264
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,672
Watch the car, watch the car.

265
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,040
Get in the car.

266
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:46,046
Get out of here!

267
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,515
Heya, kid. Balloon.

268
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,085
Food! Got to get a hot dog.

269
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:52,719
Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.

270
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:55,189
Ow, hot! Hot!

271
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,590
Need booze.

272
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:58,625
Now flush it out.
Now flush it out.

273
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,094
Booze, booze, booze!

274
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,933
Got to flush them out.

275
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,470
I'm coming.
Oh, sick. Oh, sick.

276
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:11,472
Get out of here!

277
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,207
Ah, that's better.

278
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,741
Got to modulate, Frankie.

279
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:24,184
I'm coming, Pondy.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

280
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,819
Don't worry about it, Pondy!

281
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,621
I'm coming! Where is he?

282
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,289
Pondy? Where is he?!
Where is he?!

283
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:32,593
Oh. Keep that engine running,
Frankie!

284
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:38,899
Screwed up, Frank.
What did you do?

285
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,968
I got handsy
with some pretty young thing.

286
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,936
She looked 18 to me.
I don't know.

287
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:45,239
I'm out of control!
Oh, shit.

288
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,810
Pop the glove compartment,
Frank.

289
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:56,316
Someone's dying today, baby.

290
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,885
No, Pondy!

291
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:02,589
Give me that gun! You
got too much to live for!

292
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,458
You're right, Frank.
You're right.

293
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:06,807
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

294
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,662
Come here!

295
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:12,132
I'm coming, Pondy!

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,067
- Eat shit! Daddy!
- Ah.

297
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:16,270
Oh, he's getting his ass kicked!
Get out of my face, old man,

298
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,238
before I kick your ass
and throw you in that trunk.

299
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:20,026
<i>Now think of
something tough to say.</i>

300
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,657
Nice nips, cupcake.

301
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,214
<i> What's happening?</i>

302
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:34,753
<i>Oh, shit,</i>
<i>that bald bitch knocked me out.</i>

303
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,216
<i>I'm in the trunk, aren't I?</i>

304
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,418
<i>How long have I been in here?</i>

305
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,287
<i>Ah! Still got the gun!</i>

306
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,898
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

307
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,300
<i>Oh, shit. Where am I?</i>

308
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,804
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
<i>I'm at an impound.</i>

309
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,406
<i>Pondy's car must have</i>
<i>got towed here.</i>

310
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,010
<i>Oh, my head, is...</i>

311
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,379
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

312
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,414
<i>Oh, is that the gang?</i>

313
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,949
<i>Why are they dressed like cops?</i>

314
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,018
Hey! What the hell
are you guys doing?

315
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,419
Frank?
Frank!

316
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,988
He's in there.
Frank! What?!

317
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,726
Awesome! He did it!
You did it, man!

318
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,995
Okay, okay, now go get Dennis' car!
Yeah, come on.

319
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,930
That... Get Dennis' car?

320
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,933
Hey, your name is Dennis!

321
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,434
What the hell are
you talking about?

322
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,436
Dude, get my car before
the guard comes back!

323
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,871
Go!
Go!

324
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,439
Go!
Okay, I'm on it. I'm on it.

325
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,874
On it.

326
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,543
- Goddamn!
- Oh!

327
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,977
Big spill.

328
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,379
Oh, are you okay, man?
Are you all right?

329
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,080
You all right, Frank?!
You all right?

330
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,049
Charlie, you there? Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,551
I know. Your glasses are right in
front of you. Just-just... Where?

332
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,452
Hurry! Yeah,
go, go, go, go!

333
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,222
Faster, Frank! Faster!

334
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,690
Where?
They're right there!

335
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,026
Right there!

336
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,598
Aw, shit!

337
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,268
Run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run!

338
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,305
Run, run, run, run, Frank!
Run, Frank!

339
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,074
Eat glass, you mangy mutt.

340
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,618
<i>Come on, think of
something cool to say.</i>

341
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,086
Anybody need a ride?

342
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,155
Come on!

343
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,223
That's right.
Frankie, number one.

344
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,125
<i>Nice, Frankie!</i>
<i>You came through!</i>

345
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,595
<i>Aw, crap. This one's gonna sit</i>
<i>in the front.</i>

346
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,363
<i>I hope he doesn't try</i>
<i>to touch me.</i>

347
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,699
Don't touch me!
Oh, shit, dude, I'm sorry.

348
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,300
<i>Think of something.</i>

349
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,636
<i>Think of something good.</i>

350
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,671
Dee's a bird!

351
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,050
She is a bird! She is a bird!
That's nice!

352
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,420
It's only a bird.

353
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,487
You getting in
there deep, Frank?

354
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,557
Oh, yeah.

355
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,626
What a day, man.

356
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,294
Oh, what a day.

357
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,730
Yeah, it sure was, Charlie.
I'll tell you, though.

358
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,065
Great work, bud.
You killed it, really.

359
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,600
Ah, thanks, Charlie.

360
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,402
When you got a good plan,
you stick to it.

361
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,571
- Piece of cake.
- Yeah.

362
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,474
All right, well...
I guess we should go to sleep.

363
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,776
We've got a big day tomorrow.
We do?

364
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,779
Yeah! With...

365
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,349
You're just messing with me,
aren't you?

366
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,118
Oh, you know exactly what
we're doing tomorrow, don't you?

367
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,519
Of course I do.

368
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,355
We got the thing
with the thing. Uh, the thing.

369
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,557
We... yeah, we probably
should go to sleep.

370
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,494
Yeah. All right, well.
Hmm.

371
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,796
Could go to sleep, or, uh...

372
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,166
we could play one quick game
of night crawlers.

373
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,201
Oh. Aah!
You down for that?

374
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,137
I knew you would be.

375
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,506
All right, let me get the
blanket, let me get the blanket.

376
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,207
Okay.

377
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,310
Darkness falls.

378
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:57,182
And magic stirs.

379
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,905
As we become... the creatures
of the night...

380
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:12,322
