1
00:00:01,405 --> 00:00:03,472
You were disrespectful to me.

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,541
That's the past.

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,708
God, get a life.

4
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:08,011
This is my life, bitch.

5
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:10,713
You bitch!

6
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,649
Aw, you slut.

7
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:16,986
Ah, hold still,
Charlie-- you're flickering.

8
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,222
Sorry, it's... I'm trying to
get you good images, but I keep getting

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,190
shocked a little bit.

10
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:22,926
Well, don't let
that affect your work.

11
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:23,927
No, I'm really trying not to.

12
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:27,897
It's just that, you know, I have to run
the wires from the other building...

13
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:31,400
Building and, you know, there's
asbestos in the ducts, which...

14
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:34,737
Good for breathing, so I'm tired.

15
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,673
Why are you watching this crap?

16
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,640
Come on, turn the TV off.

17
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,576
Let's go out, let's do
something-- I'm bored.

18
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,543
Hey, let's go dancing, huh?

19
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,510
I want to do something.

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,478
Dancing?

21
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:44,246
We're watching <i>Real Housewives.</i>

22
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:46,182
<i>You know, there's nothing
real about this shit, Frank.</i>

23
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:46,983
<i>You know that, come on.</i>

24
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:48,918
<i>Real women don't even look like that.</i>

25
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:49,886
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

26
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:52,956
<i>That is what real women look like.</i>

27
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:54,023
<i>Dee, are you sick?</i>

28
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:54,991
<i>No, I feel great.</i>

29
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,259
<i>Oh, I haven't had a chance
to shower for a few days.</i>

30
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:58,227
<i>I've been gaming like a loon.</i>

31
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:59,195
<i>You've been what?</i>

32
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:01,130
<i>Gaming-- I've been playing
this online video game.</i>

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:02,065
<i>It is awesome.</i>

34
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:04,200
<i>Charlie, speaking of which, you
want to come play my avatar for</i>

35
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,135
<i>a little bit while I run some errands?</i>

36
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:07,303
<i>I don't want my crops to die.</i>

37
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,672
<i>Nah, I'm kind of busy working
for the guys at the ele...</i>

38
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,807
<i>Shit!</i>

39
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:11,975
<i>Yes, he's working for us.</i>

40
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:13,209
<i>He will do nothing of the sort.</i>

41
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:14,276
<i>We're going dancing. Come on!</i>

42
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,613
<i>What if I give you three bucks?</i>

43
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,780
<i>Hey, you're our employee.</i>

44
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:18,748
<i>You do what we say.</i>

45
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:19,716
<i>I pay your rent.</i>

46
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:20,683
<i>Do not drop those wires!</i>

47
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:22,819
<i>Hey, Charlie, to live is to dance.
Let's go.</i>

48
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,887
<i>Charlie, what if I gave you five bucks?</i>

49
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:25,855
<i>You owe me five bucks!</i>

50
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,191
<i>Ah, shit! Screw it!</i>

51
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,359
<i>Son of a bitch! Shit!</i>

52
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:31,728
<i>All right, I'll tell you what.</i>

53
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:33,562
<i>I'm gonna go with Dee, okay?</i>

54
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,798
<i>But I'm getting sick of
this shit, I really am.</i>

55
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:38,134
<i>You treat me like a dumb-dumb
and a grunt, and I have</i>

56
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,336
<i>potential, you know?</i>

57
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:44,007
<i>I can go places, I can do things.</i>

58
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:45,141
<i>Who knows?</i>

59
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:50,446
<i>I might even rule the world one day.</i>

60
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:52,073
<i>Rule the world, huh?</i>

61
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:53,850
<i>Yeah, if that happens, I'll blow myself.</i>

62
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:15,928
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by

63
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,338
Okay, so it's called
<i>TechPocalypse,</i> right?

64
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:24,307
And we're post-apocalypse, and
we have to rebuild civilization.

65
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:26,569
This is me, ZingingCutie23.

66
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:28,854
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!

67
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:29,822
ZingingCutie 23.

68
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,024
Are you pretending that
you're 23 years old?

69
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,159
- No.
- It seems like it.

70
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,420
No, I... It's... I... It's a
random number that I picked.

71
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,472
It's a random number?

72
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,674
It's a number to put at the end of that.
You know what?

73
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,659
Just watch over my tribe, and
make sure nobody, you know,

74
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,727
takes it over, and I'll
give you your money, okay?

75
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:43,862
Okay. Okay. Wait.

76
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,829
Hold on a second. What is that?

77
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:45,997
That's you.

78
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:46,965
You're one of my subjects.

79
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,167
That's me.

80
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,301
Why am I in the game?

81
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,269
Is that Mac?

82
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,437
Of course that's Mac.

83
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,404
You guys are all here.

84
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,405
See, Mac's my handmaiden.

85
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,606
How do you do?

86
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,574
How do you do?

87
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,709
And Dennis is a midget blacksmith.

88
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,878
Frank is a mutant half-donkey.

89
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,147
And you're my jester.

90
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,316
Why am I eating out of a trough?

91
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,284
Made sense.

92
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,251
Are you kidding me?

93
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,219
So let me get this straight.

94
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,188
You've been playing this game
for, like, a week straight just

95
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,156
so you feel like you lord over all of us?
Is that what this is?

96
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,092
Charlie, do you want
your five bucks or not?

97
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,059
I want my five dollars.

98
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,060
It's just pathetic, Dee.

99
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,027
Okay, well, maybe it is.

100
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,995
Maybe it isn't.

101
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,198
I really do need the money, though.

102
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,165
Yeah, well, then get to work.

103
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,133
Can you give me an advance?

104
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,101
No, not in advance.

105
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,302
We'll see how well you do.

106
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,269
All right, I got this.

107
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,106
I got this.

108
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,548
Yeah.

109
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,718
See, this is what I'm
talking about, guys, huh?

110
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,053
I mean, playing online video
games and watching stupid

111
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,423
reality shows-- that's not real life.

112
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,391
It's keeping people from
experiencing real life.

113
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,559
Yeah?

114
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,527
This is real.

115
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,662
It's real, but it feels weird as shit.

116
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,797
There's nobody else in the bar dancing.

117
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,933
We're setting the tone, Frank.

118
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,136
Yeah, we will lead, and
others will follow.

119
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,303
I'm stopping.

120
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,271
Oh, come on, don't stop.

121
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,106
Look, all right, let's go do
some shots, and that will get

122
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,808
you guys fired up, and we'll
come back out, and we'll do some

123
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:04,776
more of this or whatever.

124
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,779
You know, you can do the move, and...
well, come on, come on, come on, come on.

125
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,714
Hey, uh, bartender, three
shots of whiskey, come on.

126
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,715
Hey, I know you guys.

127
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,851
You're the donkey man and
the princess, right?

128
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,020
We don't know what you're talking about.

129
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,021
Take a hike, Bozo.

130
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,189
Geek.

131
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,157
Check it out. Look at this.

132
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,124
This is... this is you, right?

133
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,092
This-this is Frank and-and Mac
from ZingingCutie's tribe?

134
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,394
What the hell is this?

135
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,564
This is Dee's online video game, and
she's created characters for all of us.

136
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,532
She's humiliating us virtually.

137
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,599
Who cares? It's a video game.

138
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,634
What do you mean, who cares?

139
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,834
This is starting to piss me off.

140
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,970
Stop getting invested in fake realities.

141
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,138
Let's live real life!

142
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,274
Well, Dennis, my anger feels very real.

143
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,275
Are you feeling it?

144
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,442
Are you feeling it?

145
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,410
Yeah, well, it's not real.

146
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,378
It's not.

147
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,379
I-I-I... I'm angry.

148
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,147
Okay, it's not real, and you
know what it also isn't?

149
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,081
It also isn't epic, okay?

150
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:43,915
And you know what is epic?

151
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,750
Doing these shots, going
out there and dancing.

152
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,951
Come on, do it, do the shots.

153
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:47,919
I'll do the shots.

154
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,887
I'll just do the shots.

155
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,088
How about that?

156
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,256
Mm-hmm.

157
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,798
Oh, somebody got a smart phone.

158
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,966
Okay, you know, I tell you what, Carl.

159
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:02,934
Let's settle for a C trade.

160
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:03,868
We'll call it a day on that.

161
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,070
I got to run.

162
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,206
ZingingCutie44 is back, so I'm out.

163
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,173
Changed your name.

164
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,342
What the hell are you doing, Charlie?

165
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,511
I told you to just feed my crops.

166
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,479
I did, I fed your crops, and
then I gathered some rocks, and

167
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,615
I built a little wall around your tribe.

168
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,551
Then I used the leftover rocks to dam
the river so that you could fish.

169
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,653
Now you're doing well in the game.

170
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,654
You sucked at it, all right?

171
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,556
All you did was spend your money
on stuff you don't need, just

172
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,524
like in real life.

173
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,558
I don't do that in real life.

174
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,526
Yes, you do.

175
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,460
What did you get at the store?

176
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,496
I bought a smart phone so that
I can play the game on the go.

177
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,398
What's going on with the fingernails?

178
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,467
Well, I had those done like Flo-Jo.

179
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,435
Why?! It's craziness.

180
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,571
I just thought it would be funny.
I... Dee, this is your problem.

181
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,373
I could take this money, I
could feed myself for a month.

182
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,342
I would buy milk, I would buy
flour, I'd buy vitamins, I'd

183
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,278
boil them down to little energy balls
to sustain me, but whatever. Forget it.

184
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,648
Enjoy your game, enjoy all your new
followers, and you're welcome.

185
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,616
Oh, shit!

186
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,751
Charlie, you got me 31 new followers?

187
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,885
Yeah.

188
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,853
That's amazing!

189
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,955
Hey, do you want to maybe team up?

190
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,124
No, 'cause I don't want to be a slave.

191
00:05:59,191 --> 00:05:59,924
Come on, Charlie, please.

192
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:00,892
I need you.

193
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,028
It's, like, when I'm doing good in
the game, I'm doing good in life.

194
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,864
Oh, I want to make fun of you
for saying that, but I kind of

195
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,831
know what you mean.

196
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,799
It's like I'm thriving.

197
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,767
You are thriving.

198
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,535
Yeah, I did feel that, and I...
You felt that?

199
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,437
I did, I felt that, you know,
and I never get to thrive.

200
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,239
I want to be the guy
who thrives for once.

201
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,073
Right? Me, neither.

202
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,809
All right, I'll tell you what-- make
me your king, and let's get rocking.

203
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,678
Ew, no. I don't want to do
that 'cause we'd have to be

204
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,580
married, and that would be awful.

205
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,581
Oh, okay, I'll see you later.

206
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,448
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

207
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,349
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

208
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,318
I'll make you my king; just
accept my request to consummate.

209
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,486
Consummate? What is that?

210
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,654
Have sex.

211
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,022
Oh. So, um, we should have sex then?

212
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,157
In the game.

213
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,493
Yeah, in the game, sure, yeah.

214
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,727
Yeah.

215
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,895
Either way.

216
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:40,666
Uh, so, push enter hard, or one,
like, slow push, and you do your

217
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,268
thing, or a little circular action?

218
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,570
Just push the button, Charlie.

219
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,639
Just push the button.

220
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,345
That was good, right?

221
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,680
Was it?

222
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,549
I think.

223
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,984
You see me, Frank, you see me coming?

224
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,453
I see you, I see you.

225
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,521
Oh, here comes another guy.

226
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,488
I'm gonna fight him.

227
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,389
Mac attack!

228
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,725
Fight!

229
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,693
I lost again!

230
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,594
Goddamn it, how do I keep losing?

231
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,395
I'm huge.

232
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,063
Stop fighting every guy in the game.

233
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,832
The fighting is the best part.

234
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,767
It's the only reason I'm playing.

235
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,836
Oh, my God, will you guys please shut up?

236
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,204
I'm hungover as shit.

237
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,572
We're playing <i>TechPocalypse.</i>

238
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:27,045
<i>Mac is a soiled fool, and I am a
gorgeous girl with big cans and</i>

239
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:30,181
<i>I'm banging all the fishermen
in sight for fish and I'm also</i>

240
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,785
<i>being catty with all the women in the
game, like I'm a Real Housewife.</i>

241
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,787
<i>Look, Dennis, I-I'm six-foot- ten.</i>

242
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,656
<i>I have always wanted to be six- foot-ten.</i>

243
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,592
<i>Hey, look, Mac, you're five-
foot-nine, and Frank, you're a</i>

244
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,027
<i>man-- an ugly, old man!</i>

245
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,231
<i>You're not understanding this,
Dennis, but I think I have</i>

246
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,933
<i>something that could help you
wrap your head around it.</i>

247
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,574
<i>I've never had my hair cut in a bedroom.</i>

248
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,843
<i>Well, one thing I've learned
from cutting hair all these</i>

249
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,945
<i>years, Danielle, is you don't
have to go to a high-end salon</i>

250
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,783
<i>to get a high-end salon-quality cut.</i>

251
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,751
<i>Little spritz?</i>

252
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,486
<i>Why are we watching Dennis' sex tape?</i>

253
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,520
<i>Shh.</i>

254
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,488
<i>It's cold.</i>

255
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,321
<i>I know.</i>

256
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,357
<i>Well, we'll make it hot in a
minute, don't worry about that.</i>

257
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,028
<i>Well, don't... Well,
it's always-- there's</i>

258
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,830
<i>always so much, so much preamble.</i>

259
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,798
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

260
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,766
<i>Okay.</i>

261
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,567
<i>Oh, oh, um, all right.</i>

262
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,535
<i>All right.</i>

263
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,503
<i>Whoa.</i>

264
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,006
<i>Now, Dennis, how does this make you feel?</i>

265
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:28,973
<i>Powerful.</i>

266
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:35,781
<i>Yes, of course, but how does
it affect you sexually?</i>

267
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,882
<i>I'm very aroused right now.</i>

268
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:37,849
<i>I, too, am aroused.</i>

269
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,817
<i>I'm starting to swell up.</i>

270
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:39,785
<i>Yeah.</i>

271
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,588
<i>See, now all three of us are aroused,
and there's not a woman in the room.</i>

272
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,625
<i>See, this is no different
than sports or video games.</i>

273
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,192
<i>It's all a virtual experience.</i>

274
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,696
<i>No, no, no, bullshit, this was
real, okay, this happened, I</i>

275
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,697
<i>did this.</i>

276
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,667
<i>All right, I drew this woman in,
I styled her hair, I entered her</i>

277
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,536
<i>with almost no resistance.</i>

278
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,737
<i>I did these things.</i>

279
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,806
<i>You say it's real, but
what even is reality?</i>

280
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,606
<i>Yeah, who knows?</i>

281
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,475
<i>We don't even know if we're in this room.</i>

282
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,944
<i>We could be in a turtle's
dream in outer space.</i>

283
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:06,978
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

284
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,114
<i>I'm gonna go out into the real world
again today and have real experiences.</i>

285
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,851
<i>I'm gonna draw those
people in to me, okay?</i>

286
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,819
<i>A turtle's dream.</i>

287
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,987
<i>That's crazy, lunacy.</i>

288
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,061
So, tell me something, Queen
of Thrones, how about we stop

289
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,731
being enemies, we start
becoming friends here, huh?

290
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:33,801
Charlie, I just got a new nose and I'm
flying to Miami to get my lips inflated.

291
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:34,902
Can you hang on one second?

292
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,803
What, Dee, what are you buying?

293
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:36,705
How are you paying for that?

294
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:37,505
We have plenty of money.

295
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:38,340
I know we have money.

296
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,974
We have money because I...
All right, you know what?

297
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,677
Yes, fine, buy your lips, buy your
noses, buy whatever you're gonna buy.

298
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:44,512
All right, don't interrupt me
when I'm running our tribe,

299
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,348
okay, 'cause that's kind of a big deal.

300
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,181
I know, I'm sorry.

301
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,983
All right, so don't interrupt.

302
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:49,951
Okay.

303
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,487
Do me a favor, refill my
bowl of energy balls, okay?

304
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:53,488
Please make yourself useful.

305
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:57,225
Sorry about that, Queen of Thrones,
let me step into my office here.

306
00:09:57,293 --> 00:10:01,363
Hey, bitch!

307
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,331
Frank, you are SweetPeaches69?

308
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,467
How did you get so many followers?

309
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:06,768
What can I say?

310
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:09,638
Some girls are more popular than others.

311
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,273
Are you wearing a mink coat?

312
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,440
What, this old thing?

313
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,876
Guy gave it to me for going down on him.

314
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:16,944
I've been getting a lot of gifts lately.

315
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,848
I just got sent a whole box
of peaches-- real ones.

316
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,951
I'm eating like a goddamn islander.

317
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,888
I'm living a pretty
classy life these days.

318
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,757
Ooh, you should come to my party.

319
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:31,626
I'm gonna meet a lot of
my online friends there.

320
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:35,797
It's gonna be a very classy
affair, but you can come anyway.

321
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,201
Well, look, we can sit here, we
can talk cheesesteaks all day

322
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,170
long, but maybe you and I could
get together at my bar, settle

323
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,070
this thing once and for all.

324
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:43,905
Charlie, we got to talk.

325
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:44,872
Whoa.

326
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,808
We're going to a party-- a real
one-- Frank's throwing it.

327
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,776
Yes, I know what's going on.

328
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:49,611
I know everything that's happening.

329
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,780
Do you know he has a bunch of followers?

330
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,582
Do you know that he's parading around
in a mink coat, and he humiliated me?

331
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,950
I'm a queen, okay?

332
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:59,387
I should be the one wearing mink and
I should be throwing digs at him.

333
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,221
You know what I mean?

334
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,023
I should have a lot more followers.

335
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,725
You want mink, Dee, you want a mink coat?

336
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,660
You want a nice, real mink coat,
not a virtual one like Frank?

337
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:06,661
Don't dick around with this.

338
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:07,462
Are you serious?

339
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,296
I am dead serious.

340
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,164
I trade with a guy online;
he has a clothing store.

341
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,133
I'm sure I could give him some
crops, maybe a follower or two,

342
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,167
and he'll give you a mink coat.

343
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,001
For me?

344
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,803
Would you like that?

345
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,637
I would love that.

346
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,271
You, you would like that, wouldn't you?

347
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,173
You know how that's not gonna happen?

348
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,174
What?

349
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:24,078
It's not gonna happen if I'm
not playing the goddamn game!

350
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,848
Because when I'm not playing the
game, people are attacking our

351
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:30,117
tribe, okay, and that's a lot of
pressure, that's a lot of stress.

352
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:30,952
It's too much for you.

353
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,488
And we could lose everything, we
could lose everything that we

354
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,122
have worked for-- everything!

355
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,090
I wasn't thinking.

356
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:37,826
No, you're not really the
thinking kind, though.

357
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:40,695
I'm kind of the thinking one in the
relationship, so... Right, thank you.

358
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,397
Be pretty, you know, talk to me right.

359
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:43,365
Yeah.

360
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,932
Get my energy balls.

361
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:49,671
Unbelievable.

362
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,673
Hey, Charlie, we need to talk, dude.

363
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:56,544
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the soiled fool.

364
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:57,412
Frank told you about that?

365
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,313
Uh, no, everyone's talking about
it online; it's hilarious.

366
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:01,048
You destroyed your computer,
you bashed it to bits.

367
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:04,018
I'm assuming it got you in the eye--
is that what's going on there?

368
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,887
It bashed me back a little bit.

369
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,689
Yeah, you should win those
fights, you shouldn't lose...

370
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,924
I did win, I did win, it just
got a couple of good shots in.

371
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:10,759
It did, yeah.

372
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,494
Hey, Charlie, hey, listen, I
want to tell you something.

373
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:14,262
Um, Dee... Yeah?

374
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:17,766
You're not going to offer our guest any?

375
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,734
Of course I-- of course,
that's what I was doing.

376
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:20,702
Yeah.

377
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,670
Hey, Mac, hey, did you, did you
want an energy ball or two?

378
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:23,638
Yeah.

379
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,540
Go ahead, have as many as
you want-- is that enough?

380
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:26,574
That's-- yeah, that's good.

381
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:27,409
There you go, okay.

382
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:28,309
Okay, you need to fuel up.

383
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:29,110
Have a bunch of balls.

384
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:29,944
Yeah, I do, thank you.

385
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:30,745
Okay, thank you.

386
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:31,579
Okay-- don't touch.

387
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:32,380
No, now I know.

388
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:33,381
Right, yeah.

389
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:34,181
I didn't mean that.

390
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,917
And stop groveling, just...
Let me know if you need...

391
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:40,221
You're not pretty when you do that, so...
Wow, you, like, totally

392
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,023
psychologically, like, annihilated her.

393
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,990
Yeah.

394
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,393
You're good at building,
I'm good at destroying.

395
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,929
We should totally team up.

396
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:49,130
Wait, you know what?

397
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:50,097
Can you do me a favor?

398
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:53,034
Can you watch her for a little while while
I go meet a girl that I met online?

399
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:53,868
A real girl?

400
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:54,669
Yeah, a real girl.

401
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:55,637
She's probably fat, right?

402
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:56,438
Probably very fat, yeah.

403
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,239
If she's got any fat
friends, I'm, I'm in.

404
00:12:58,307 --> 00:12:59,974
If she has any fat friends,
I'll let you know.

405
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:00,775
Or ugly.

406
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:01,609
Yeah, or ugly.

407
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,645
If they're sick, that's fine, too.

408
00:13:03,712 --> 00:13:06,581
Yeah, or ugly or sick or, or male or
female or whatever it is that you like.

409
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:07,415
That's not the point.

410
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,317
Like, the point is, you
know how women get.

411
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:12,086
You know, she catches wind that I'm
meeting a girl, she's going to go...

412
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:12,887
Oh, totally, totally.

413
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:13,721
I hate women.

414
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,624
Yeah, I-I know that you feel
that way, but do what I'm asking

415
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,461
and then I can help you
out with the game.

416
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:20,428
Okay, do what?

417
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:21,295
Watch Dee.

418
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:24,999
Oh, okay, yeah.

419
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,668
Hello, hi.

420
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:27,635
Anyone?

421
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:30,071
Come on, hello, hi.

422
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,038
God, it's unbelievable.

423
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:33,007
Does anybody want to experience this?

424
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,108
Anyone want to experience me?

425
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:35,242
For real?

426
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,713
Oasis Sensory Deprivation.

427
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,950
Enter a new dimension.

428
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:45,219
Change your perception.

429
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:49,991
Experience a new reality.

430
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:53,695
Experience a new reality.

431
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:58,566
Stop getting invested in fake realities!

432
00:13:58,634 --> 00:13:59,534
I'm six foot, ten.

433
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:00,535
You're five foot, nine.

434
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,638
What even is reality?

435
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:04,739
This is real.

436
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:06,774
How do you do?

437
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:09,477
We could be in a turtle's
dream in outer space.

438
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,614
What is real?

439
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:14,582
Is this real? Am I?

440
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,350
Who are you?

441
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:18,219
Oh, I'm you.

442
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,787
Huh.

443
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:21,422
That's an amazing accent.

444
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,558
I like yours as well.

445
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:27,962
I think I know what reality
is, but maybe I don't.

446
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,932
Everything in life is becoming
more and more virtual.

447
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,034
Aw, don't be such a wanker.

448
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:35,269
Life is all in your mind.

449
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:38,105
If you believe it to be
real, then it's real.

450
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,308
I'm so confused, British Dennis.

451
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,677
You create your own reality.

452
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:46,614
I've known beggars to be kings
and kings to be beggars, all

453
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:47,949
because they believed it so.

454
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,618
It's your choice.

455
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,621
It's my choice.

456
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:56,090
It's your universe.

457
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,359
It's my universe.

458
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:01,111
And you are God.

459
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:04,925
I... am... God.

460
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,609
Oh... oh... oh, no... okay.

461
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:17,478
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

462
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,272
Charlie?

463
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:32,607
Hey.

464
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,208
Julie, right?

465
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:35,710
The Queen of Thrones!

466
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,679
The second most powerful
player in the game.

467
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:40,681
And you are the Mighty Rat Slayer.

468
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:41,649
'Tis I, 'tis I!

469
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:42,650
It's nice to meet you!

470
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:45,720
Yeah, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I
haven't had a chance to tidy myself.

471
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,689
You know, when you're playing the
game, you get caught up and...

472
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:49,957
Have a seat! Have a seat!

473
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,927
Wow, this is... It's cool to meet
someone from the game, you know?

474
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,928
I brought you something.

475
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,929
You did?

476
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:55,897
It's nothing, really.

477
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:59,266
It's just, um... the best
cheesecake in Philadelphia.

478
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,436
You dog!

479
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,504
Uh, I'll be the judge of that, all right?

480
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:04,872
You little rascal, you.

481
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,007
Uh, I don't normally meet
people from the game, but you

482
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,443
seem like such a nice guy.

483
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,279
Thanks, yeah, yeah, you know...
This is embarrassing, but I got

484
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,881
you something too, you know?

485
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,016
I don't want... I don't want to
make you feel weird but here.

486
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,251
Oh, how thoughtful.

487
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,753
I wonder what it is.

488
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,754
It's not much.

489
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:20,721
Just a box of spiders.

490
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:21,856
What the hell?

491
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:23,925
Well, while we've been sitting
here, my followers have

492
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,662
burned your land, they've raped your
people, and they've destroyed your tribe.

493
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,364
You thought you could make a
move on me, Queen of Thrones?

494
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,365
Well, you were wrong.

495
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,366
What?

496
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:34,401
I just wanted to have lunch with you.

497
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,369
Oh, right.

498
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:39,507
Oh, let's have lunch because we're
hungry and we want to eat food.

499
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:40,475
Bullshit!

500
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,477
You think I'd give up all this for lunch?

501
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,444
You stupid, fat pig.

502
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,912
I'm not fat.

503
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,881
No, you're not fat, but you were...
you were supposed to be.

504
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,850
My friend Mac said you would be fat.

505
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:49,851
Whatever.

506
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,018
You're a dick.

507
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:53,354
And your breath smells like dog food.

508
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,925
Whatever, you bitch!

509
00:16:57,993 --> 00:16:59,293
I got the power now!

510
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:03,330
I'm doing good in the game,
so I'm doing good in life!

511
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,537
Oh, look who's here.

512
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,506
Well, it's nice that you came.

513
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:12,573
A little overdressed.

514
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,809
You said that this was a
classy affair, Frank.

515
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,111
It was a classy affair
until you showed up.

516
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,715
You bitch!

517
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,718
Where are your 101 Dalmatians tonight?

518
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,687
He's better at the zings than you!

519
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,656
All right, Dee, give me your
phone, give me your headset-- I

520
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:29,657
got to get back online ASAP.

521
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:31,626
I just made some big things happen.

522
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:32,627
Big things, baby!

523
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,594
Boom!

524
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:34,595
No.

525
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,564
She's not with you anymore, bro.

526
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:37,565
Hold on. Shut up.

527
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,534
Wh-Why is the soiled fool talking to me?

528
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,536
I don't need you anymore, Charlie.

529
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,503
I'd like a divorce.

530
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:44,772
Ooh! Juicy!

531
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,241
Wait, what are you talking about?

532
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:49,343
I know you were gonna leave me
for the Queen of Thrones, so

533
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,478
I've slept with Mac to humiliate you.

534
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:54,448
She's humiliated you and
herself by sleeping with me.

535
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:55,449
I'm good at the game now.

536
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,418
Oh, my God, Dee, you stupid idiot.

537
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:59,386
Do you... do you have
a brain in your head?

538
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,556
I was tricking that girl, so
that I could destroy her tribe.

539
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,591
We're the most powerful tribe
in the whole game now!

540
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:04,559
What are you doing?!

541
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,628
Uh... you know, I-I guess
maybe I hadn't really thought

542
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:08,629
the whole thing through.

543
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:09,764
No, you didn't think!

544
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:12,533
Because you don't think!

545
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,703
You're just a stupid
kept housewife, okay?

546
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:16,704
Zing it, girl!

547
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,506
Frank, shut the hell up!

548
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,576
How dare you all conspire against me?

549
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,577
How dare you?!

550
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,545
You know what, I want everyone out.

551
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,547
Everyone get out of my apartment, okay?

552
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,515
No, not you, not you, and not you.

553
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:30,117
The three of you, sit!

554
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:34,288
Get out!

555
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,591
Okay, I think we can all agree
that this game is the most

556
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,559
important thing that ever
happened to us, right?

557
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,629
Absolutely, yeah... It's very important...
That's the truth.

558
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:43,598
It's a hugely important thing!

559
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,433
So because I'm a nice guy, you
know, 'cause I'm a cool dude,

560
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,036
I'll let you live, all right?

561
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:52,006
But, Mac and Frank, you got to give
me your shares of Paddy's Pub.

562
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,007
Done!

563
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:54,008
What?

564
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:54,976
Yes!

565
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,978
And, Dee, you're gonna have to
do all the Charlie-work in the

566
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,981
bar from here until-- oh, I don't
know-- how's eternity sound?

567
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:04,251
Stop... This
game has gone on long enough.

568
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,252
Uh, shit.

569
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,253
Are you doing an accent?

570
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,222
Yeah, I was doing a British acc...
It was a British accent.

571
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,223
That was British?!

572
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,191
Yeah, I had it so good in my
head-- uh, I was doing a really

573
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,192
good British accent.

574
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,196
Doesn't matter. Anyway... Charlie,
you think you have all the power?

575
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:17,932
Well, you don't.

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,202
You see, the only thing
bigger than a king is a god.

577
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,537
You think you're a god?

578
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,539
I'm the one who's thriving, Dennis.

579
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,141
I mean, look at me.

580
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,144
You look like you're
covered in Hawaiian Punch.

581
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,145
Yeah?

582
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,146
Yeah.

583
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,114
Eh.

584
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,816
I am the god of my own universe, Charlie.

585
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:40,988
I decide my own reality, and I've
decided all of your realities as well.

586
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:45,492
So, you see, I unplugged it.

587
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,861
You... unplugged reality?

588
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,963
I don't understand what he's saying.

589
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:49,964
Me neither.

590
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:52,700
I just... I deleted all of
your characters from the game.

591
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:53,701
What?

592
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,669
I erased all your... people.

593
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,670
H-How did you do that?

594
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,671
Well, it was easy.

595
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,639
You guys all have the same
password, "paddyspub."

596
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:00,607
Oh, that's my password for everything.

597
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:01,608
Mine, too.

598
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:02,609
Why would you do that though?

599
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,578
Why would you delete our characters?

600
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:06,781
Because the goddamn game
was irritating to me.

601
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:08,783
I thought it was really stupid,
and it really is just, you know,

602
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,385
sort of that simple, so I
ended the game, you know.

603
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,352
That's the end.

604
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,322
Doesn't have to be a whole big
thing every single time, you know.

605
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,323
That's life.

606
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,325
That's just sort of how-how shit goes.

607
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,797
Sometimes things just sort of... end.
