00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,838
[ frank ] dennis,
stop acting like a child.
I don't want to hear it, dad.

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,174
Deandra, move the pool table
so you and your brother
can lay some grout.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,377
I am not laying grout.

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,379
You guys are
being babies.
Babies.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,714
We're being babies, mac?
Why don't you go work
for your dad all day?

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,851
- my dad's a meth dealer.
- [ mock crying ]
oh, oh, no!

7
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:22,921
My daddy's in prison!
My daddy used to give
hot shots to prostitutes.

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,991
<i>- [ dennis ] feel sorry for me!
- I got the grout.</i>

9
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,093
- dad, you're not
even listening to us.
- are you really leaving?

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,229
- yes!
- later, bitches.

11
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,731
- yeah, have a good life now.
- all right, look.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,102
I know what you're doin'.
I can play this game. Mac and me
and charlie can run the bar.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,171
Great. Terrific. Good idea.
Great. We got
better things to do.

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,006
Please. What are
you two gonna do?

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,642
Dee and I have a little
something we like
to call "goals."

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,045
Weird, right?
We have aspirations
outside of this bar.

17
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,914
We got big dreams, mac.
We're gonna go follow 'em.

18
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,983
You guys have nothing
without this bar.

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,786
Don't worry about us, mac.
We'll be just fine.

20
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,420
<i>[ dennis ]
so what are your dreams?
[ dee ] hmm?</i>

21
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,224
Your goals.
What are your aspirations?
Were you serious about that?

22
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,293
Yeah! What are you doing?

23
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,729
Signing us up for
unemployment benefits.
Unemployment? No.

24
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,299
Dee, that's for deadbeats.
Come on. We got
a golden opportunity here.

25
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,369
You know? We can do
anything we want if
we put our minds to it.

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,373
Well, I guess I could
use this time to get
my acting career off the ground.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,441
And I fully support you.
You do?

28
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,079
Absolute-- the old dennis would
have said, "dee, your sad little
acting ship sailed a decade ago.

29
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,884
It's pathetic." but the new
dennis says that it's not my
place to kill your pipe dreams.

30
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,953
- you should go for it.
- really?

31
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,623
Yes! Come on. This is america!
We're gonna go for it!
We're gonna work hard!

32
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,993
We're gonna reach for the
stars! We're gonna become more
successful than our parents.

33
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,295
- we can shove it
in their faces.
- make 'em eat shit!

34
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,798
[ laptop chimes ]
oh, look, we qualified.

35
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,567
Really? How much?
400 a week.

36
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,604
400-- that's more
than we made at the bar.
I know.

37
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,142
Okay, new plan.

38
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,210
We're gonna go
on unemployment.
Yeah.

39
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,513
- that's what it's
there for, right?
- in the meantime...

40
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,384
We will focus
and work hard and keep
our nose to the grindstone.

41
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,453
<i>Right?</i>

42
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,455
Absolutely.

43
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,126
[ charlie ]
ready?
[ mac ] yeah.

44
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,096
One, two, three.

45
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,098
[ straining ]

46
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,803
Goddamn it!
Wha-- why can you
not lift your end?

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,139
-I don't know, dude. Let me
figure out what is happening.
-are you lifting with your back?

48
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,775
Of course
I'm lifting with my back.
I think your end is lighter.

49
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,844
The balls have
rolled down to this end.

50
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,946
No! You got to snap
your back up and lift.

51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,350
I'm jerking my back up!
What do you want from me?
Hey, what's the ruckus?

52
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,719
I'm trying to conduct important
business back there.

53
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,822
We finished with the tile.
Now we're trying to move
the pool table back.

54
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,858
All right, all right, all right.
Have you done the urinal?

55
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,495
Because the urinal,
you flush it, and it sprays
all over the place.

56
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,298
Yeah, I know.
Look, bro. You gotta stop
bossing us around, okay?

57
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,300
I mean, look at charlie.
You're breaking his spirit.

58
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,902
Look at me.
I'm broken, dude.
Look, I'm--

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,805
You guys need a father figure.
And I'm trying to be
that father figure,

60
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,874
And someday you're
gonna thank me for it.

61
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,478
And that's all there is to it.
Trust me.
Trust me on that one.

62
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,014
You're gonna
thank me for it.
[ door closes ]

63
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,551
I don't want a father figure.

64
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,721
 [ both singing
with boom box ]
 oh, baby, you 

65
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,958
 you got what I need 

66
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,527
 but you say
he's just a friend 

67
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,596
 but you say
he's just a friend 

68
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,465
 oh, baby, you-- 
come down
just a little bit.

69
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,901
He's not hitting it
that high, you know?

70
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,437
 oh, baby, you-- 
now you should split
the difference.

71
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,539
You got to split
the difference.
Yeah, split the difference.

72
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,208
What the hell is this?

73
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,779
Oh, living the dream, bro.
Living the dream.
 [ turns off ]

74
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,048
I thought you two
were out looking for
careers or something.

75
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,518
We are. We're just getting
a little bit of assistance
to help us out over the hump.

76
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,121
And this unemployment thing
is so great, because we've
made really big plans.

77
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,657
[ laughs ]
I'm gonna be a veterinarian.
Yeah.

78
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,027
And I am gonna move to new york,
and I'm gonna be on broadway.
Mm-hmm.

79
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,297
What?
It's 1:00 in the afternoon,
and you're piss-ass drunk.

80
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,335
Well, it's a slow process,
man. It takes a little time.
But we trust the system.

81
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,437
Is that a new watch,
dude?
It is. It's awesome.

82
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,106
And I got
a jesus chain.
It's good. Look at it.

83
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,642
All right, look, guys.
We want you to come back
to the bar, okay?

84
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,678
Why in the hell
would we do that?
You're not even listening to me.

85
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,880
Did you see my jesus chain?
I'm busting my ass
in that bar,

86
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,083
And you guys are
sitting on the stoop
getting drunk all day long?

87
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,752
[ mock crying ]
what, this again?
What, this again?

88
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,788
I have to work!
Cry for me.
Cry for me.

89
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,458
I don't know how
to take advantage
of government programs.

90
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,762
Unemployment runs out.
And once it does, you guys are
gonna be back out on your asses.

91
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,932
Once it runs out,
we're gonna go on welfare, dude.
Yup.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,267
Welfare?
Mm-hmm.

93
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,337
You guys can't
go on welfare.
Oh, really?

94
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,007
It's reserved for people
who need it, you know?

95
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,809
Like poor people
who need some help thr--

to continue--
 oh, baby, you 

97
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,350
It's not for overprivileged
pieces of shit who want to waste
millions of dollars in tax--

98
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,020
You want to play this game?
We gonna play this game now?

99
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,456
 but you say
he's just a friend 
goddamn you!

100
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,026
<i> oh, baby, you 
goddamn it!</i>

101
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,428
 got what I need 

102
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,798
Charlie, sign here,
here and here.

103
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:37,336
So, you're giving me
all your money.

104
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:42,641
Charlie, for the 500th time,
I'm not giving it to you.
It's not yours.

105
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,512
I'm just setting up
a temporary account
in your name.

106
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,381
What my wife can't find,
she can't get.

107
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,852
Right. This is good.
This is shady, frank.
I like this kind of stuff.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,189
But you will be handsomely
rewarded if you just keep
your hands off this money.

109
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,925
Right, right.
So what's the vig?

110
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,929
The vig?
Yeah, man.

111
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,232
You know, what's--
what's the vig on
this action here?

112
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,735
Do you even know
what "vig" means?

113
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,505
Hey-ohh!
What's up, bitches?

114
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,009
- get your gloves. I got a lot
of grout work for you to do.
- forget the grout.

115
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,678
I have been doing
a little research that will
change our lives forever.

116
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,182
Turns out there's
a little program called
work for welfare...

117
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,019
In which businesses
hire potential
welfare recipients,

118
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,855
The government
subsidizes their wage,

119
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,891
And the I.R.S. Affords
thousands of dollars
in tax relief.

120
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,328
Oh, I don't know
what you're saying.

121
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,198
Dude, is that a question?
I don't understand.
What's going on?

122
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,067
Don't you get it?
We will never need
dennis and dee again.

123
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:47,539
We hire a couple people,
pay them nothing, and get them
to do all of our work for us!

124
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,842
- we just pay them nothing?
- we pay them nothing!

125
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,944
That's incredible.
It's incredible!

126
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,781
- what do you think, frank?
- well, if we're gonna do
something like this,

127
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,650
We got to make sure
we don't abuse anybody.
No. Oh, my god!

128
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,221
I know what it's like
to grow up poor. We got to
treat people with respect.

129
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,224
Respect is the name of the game.
Respect is number one!

130
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,393
It's the name
of almost every game.
Absolutely.

131
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,230
Because we understand
the plight of the worker.
The plight!

132
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,066
Respect.
Respect the plight.

133
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,635
What do you think, frank?

134
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,039
I'm good.
Go get us some slaves.

135

[ phone ringing ]

136
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,347
No, dude.
That's not what I'm saying.

137
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,650
All I'm saying is that "slaves"
is not a racist term.
Shh!

138
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,953
Look, dude, I'm-- okay, look.
I'm saying over the history
of time, right?

139
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,190
There have been slaves
of many different races.
There's been jewish slaves.

140
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,592
I mean, uh, italian, uh--
I recognize that,
charlie.

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,696
But in this country, we have
to understand that it is
a sensitive issue, okay?

142
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,066
I understand that.
What about that one?
He seems strong.

143
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,468
Look at those
massive thighs.
Yeah, those are good thighs.

144
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,771
But you're gonna have
a problem with work ethic.
That's what I'm talking about.

145
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,940
You can't be saying
things like that.
No, dude.

146
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,610
I'm not saying that because he's
black. He's asleep in his chair.
That's true.

147
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,679
[ sighs ]
what about that one?
Don't just do that.

148
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,916
Why not?
I knew you were gonna do that.
Why are you going to him?

149
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,152
[ mutters ]
that's like reverse
affirmative action, dude.

150
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,456
You don't want to do that.
You could cheat yourself
out of a good slave here.

151
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,926
Well, how do you know he's
not gonna be a good slave?
Come on.

152
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,096
You know what? This is so
complicated and confusing.
I don't even understand.

153
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,133
Let's look at this guy.
We got to talk to someone.
Let's just talk to someone.

154
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,937
Hello. Hi.

155
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,439
We are here to sign up for
the work for welfare program.

156
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,176
My associate and I were just out
on the floor. We're looking for
a suitable candidate.

157
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,046
But the problem is it's
really tough to tell just
by eyeballing these people.

158
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,049
So we were wondering, like,
do you have, like, a face book?
Yeah.

159
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,219
Or anything that we can go over,
like their physical stats
and some kind of numbers--

160
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,221
Excuse me?
Like weight, power--

161
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,025
Something to just
"expediate" the whole process.
It doesn't work that way.

162
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:51,230
Why don't you read up on some
of the program's stipulations?

163
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,866
Ooh, that's big.
The face book?

164
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,569
<i>No. Rules and regulations.
It's, uh, sort of
a legal document.</i>

165
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,739
Now, is there any way
around this?
Ohh, you're right.

166
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,975
None whatsoever.
Okay.

167
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,044
All right, well--
thank you
for your time.

168
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,546
We got this,
so we'll read it.
Have a good one.

169
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,648
I'm not reading that.
No, I'm not
reading this either.

170
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,351
We'll get frank to do it.
Maybe get a slave
to do it.

171
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,420
Look what the cat
dragged in.
Oh, come on.

172
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,891
Oh, well, look here.
I see you've decided
to steal our welfare idea.

173
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,161
I can't say I'm surprised.
We're not stealing
your idea, okay?

174
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,697
Let's all recognize that this
is a little awkward situation...

175
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,765
Between friends
at the welfare store.

176
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,368
Let's go our separate ways,
okay?
You guys can't get welfare!

177
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,403
Uh, yeah. We can.
No, you can't!

178
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,472
They don't give it to
any jackass that walks in here.

179
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,541
It's reserved for people
who need it.
That's true.

180
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,177
Drug addicts, mentally disabled,
people with dependents--
that sort of thing.

181
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,780
Mac, we've got it covered, okay?
Dee, your bicycle helmet.

182
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,086
Later, boners.

183
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,588
[ sighs ]
that is an awesome helmet.

184
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,590
What--
go! Out!

185
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,559
Hello.

186
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,096
Hi. Um, I'm
a recovering crackhead.

187
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,598
This is my retarded sister
that I take care of.

188
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,934
I'd like some welfare,
please.

189
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,070
You're a recovering
crack addict?

190
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,639
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,477
And she's mentally retarded?

192
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,579
Oh, most definitely.

193
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,281
You have the proper
medical paperwork?

194
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,951
Medical paperwork?

195
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,988
We're gonna need
a physician's report to confirm
your sister's mental illness,

196
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:27,726
And your blood work
to confirm your...
Crack addiction.

197
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,799
Well, can't you see
how retarded she is?

198
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,868
[ grunting ]

199
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,877
[ sighs ]
lose the helmet, sis. We can't
prove that you're retarded.

200
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,379
I want that welfare, dennis.
I know you do.
So do I.

201
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,482
No, you don't understand.
I got a taste of my dream.
I can't go back.

202
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,786
I got to get to broadway,
and welfare's the key.
What do you want to do?

203
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:58,490
Oh, they want to play rough?
We can play rough.
Let's go buy some crack.

204
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,317
Okay, thank you.
We're all set. Friday, 3:00.
Full blood work.

205
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:09,419
Okay. We'll just
smoke a little bit.
A little bit.

206
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,488
Just enough to get
into our system.

207
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:14,124
Then we'll go to the doctor,
we'll get all of our paperwork,
and we'll get full benefits.

208
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,793
Then we'll collect
for just a little while
until we get settled.

209
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:19,463
Then I'll take the mcats.
And I'll move to new york.
Perfect.

210
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,998
[ gasps ]
oh, my god!

211
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:23,233
Oh, jesus!
Ooh, wow, you scared us.

212
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,837
Oh, not 'cause you're black.
No, we're not racist.
No. God, no.

213
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:29,206
It's just that
the neighborhood is scary.
If you were another ethnicity--

214
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,241
You really did pop up.
But it's a nice neighborhood.

215
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,310
No, the trees are--
it's the nature of this--

216
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,245
Roll your window down.

217
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,247
Okay.

218
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:42,586
What you need?
Uh, one, please.

219
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,755
One what?

220
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:47,758
Uh, one rock of crack.
One crack--

221
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:50,761
A crack rock.
Is that enough?
Is one crack rock enough?

222
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:54,064
See, I don't--
how much would you recommend
for a first-time user?

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,002
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

224
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,071
Two for the price of one.

225
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,440
Really?
Oh, that sounds good.

226
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:06,009
Oh. Well, that's
very nice of you.
How much?

227
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,912
Uh, $200?

228
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:13,750
Okay. Uh-huh.
Sounds reasonable.
Great.

229
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,954
Okay. Let's see here, uh--

230
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:23,260
That should be about 200.
Thanks for being so kind.
Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:27,064
And patient.

232
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,100
Pick it up down there.

233
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:33,971
Wait. Where?
Wh-which--

234
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:36,073
This one.
It's got to be that guy.

235
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,141
Don't say "this one."

236
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,880
Now, maria, after you're
done in the bathroom
you come look for me,

237
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,316
Because I got some boots
to be shined, all right?

238
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,252
Tony, go chase that leak
down in the basement,
all right?

239
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,689
Okay, boss.
Okay.
[ exhales ]

240
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:55,993
Mac, I got to hand it to you.
This is brilliant.

241
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,562
That's how I roll.
Charles?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

242
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,099
I'm gonna get nice and drunk,
play some video games
until my eyes bleed.

243
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,569
Amen to that, brother.
Me too.
I want to play charlie.

244
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:13,010
Uhh, don't you have, like,
some stuff that you need to do?
Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,212
No.
Yeah, managerial stuff.

246
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,447
Managerial stuff!
No, I got that
all cleared up.

247
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:20,283
And then I thought after
we played a video game--
uh-huh.

248
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:24,321
The three of us go outside,
throw the pigskin around,
play some two-hand touch.

249
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,357
Ooh, ooh.
Hey, that's not gonna--
that's not gonna work out.

250
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:30,260
- I'll teach you how to play.
- I already know how to play.

251
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,462
Not properly though.

252
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,865
Kind of properly.
Right. Uh, oh, charlie.

253
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,868
You know what?
We got to get into
the bathroom to show maria--

254
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:39,936
The mixing!
Charlie has this thing--
the scrubbing.

255
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:42,639
Scrubbing!
Charlie has this scrubbing thing
with the brillo.

256
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:45,342
I have a brillo.
He has a method,
and we gotta show her.

257
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,312
And make sure she's got it down.
All right.
I'll get myself a beer.

258
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:51,181
Yeah!
Yeah, get a beer.
We'll work it out over here.

259
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,283
Well, this is a development
I did not expect.

260
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,385
It's like he's really
trying to become our father.

261
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,888
I know how to play
football, charlie.
I know you do, bro.

262
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:01,491
I know you do.
Do you want me to leave?

263
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,862
Huh? No, you're good. Just--
actually, make sure you really
work that sponge in there.

264
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,031
Because otherwise,
that stain,
like, it'll--

265
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:10,834
It's not gonna get clean
if you don't.
Yeah. It's gonna get worse.

266
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:13,637
- what are we gonna do? We gotta
ditch him or something.
- tell you what.

267
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:16,940
How about you and me,
we go out on the town?
You know what I mean?

268
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:20,677
We celebrate this whole--
[ whispers ]
slave situation.

269
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,714
I'd love to, charlie.
I really would.
But we don't have any money.

270
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,249
<i>- what are we gonna do?
- oh, I got money.</i>

271
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,919
- what?
- yeah, I got a whole bunch
of money, bro.

272
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:31,021
Frank's been hiding
all of his money in my account.

273
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,891
And why was I not made
aware of this before?

274
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,295
Uh, it's got something
to do with the vig.

275
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,732
What's a vig?
Well, you know how gangsters,
they talk about a vig?

276
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,434
Yeah?
And it means--

277
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:47,004
Yeah.
Oh, a vig!
A vig.

278
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:49,239
Yeah. Well, you
should have a vig.
I should have a vig, right?

279
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:52,542
And frank didn't give me one.
Oh, that's bullshit!
You deserve a vig.

280
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,379
I do.
I'm a good guy, right?

We're good people.
All right, here's the plan.
We're gonna slip out of here.

283
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:03,086
We're gonna hit an a.T.M.
We'll take out just
a little bit of cash.

00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:05,188
Just a little.
Just enough.
He won't even notice it.

285
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:08,625
Just enough to have
a quiet night out.

We missed our
doctor's appointment.

00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:47,931
Well, only by an hour.
If we hurry,
maybe they'll still see us.

299
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,336
It was yesterday.
We missed our appointment
by an hour and a day.

300
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:54,604
We slept through a whole day?

301
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:58,408
- I feel awful.
- I feel like I'm gonna die!

like this anymore, deandra.
- mm-mmm. Me either.

303
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:05,782
Okay, listen.
Maybe if I make
a phone call right now,

304
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,452
We'll be able to make
another appointment.

305
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,589
- you think he'll see us
on such short notice?
- we have gotta try.

306
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:16,093
Hey, man. Thanks for seeing us
on such short notice.
That's what I do, baby.

That guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

309
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:28,438
No, these are old,
and I need to get
new head shots.

310
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:31,108
Because you can't have an--
an agent without head shots.

311
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:35,379
Dennis, when you become
a veterinarian, will you
buy me some new head shots?

Please? Dennis?

Yeah, I'll buy you stuff.

I'll buy you lots of things.

318
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,831
I'm definitely gonna buy
a bunch of crack.

- good. Real good.

00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:28,398
It's good on our end here.
We're putting a couple things
together lately.

do you have any money?

Please?
Oh, um--

of money. Wait!

That's enough whining,
for crying out loud!

335
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,230
I think it might be broken.
I told you not to act like
such a nancy boy out there.

336
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:04,735
Something was bound to happen.
I didn't think
it was full contact.

337
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:07,871
Well, how do you expect
to become a better player
if nobody pushes you?

338
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:10,173
Maria, go get us
some ice and three beers.

339
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:12,743
I don't drink.
Me neither.

340
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,547
You don't drink? Jesus christ!
You two are a couple of downers,
huh?

341
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:21,551
You work hard, you don't drink--
how'd you end up on welfare?

342
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,620
Well, it's a vicious cycle,

Hi. I'd like to speak with you
about some recent activity
on your new account.

348
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:42,806
Some recent activity
on my new account?

349
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:45,275
We got a big problem here,
buddy.
All right. Try it again.

350
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,344
I've tried it three times.
It's just not working.

351
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:50,414
The services have
already been rendered.
We gotta pay these girls.

He cut us off.
Is there a problem?

353
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,751
No. Not a problem here.
No problem.

354
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,953
I'm calling hector.
No, no.
Don't call hector.

355
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,389
- I'm calling wallace.
- we shouldn't be calling
hector or wallace...

Or any other large pimp.
No.

Charlie and I are gonna handle
this situation just like
we handle every situation.

We are gonna--

359
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,804
Well, you know,
we'll just go back
to work for a little while.

360
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:16,907
Just for a little while
until we have enough money
to buy some more crack.

361
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,376
Then we'll go on welfare,
and I'll go be a star.

362
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:22,279
Then I can be a veterinarian
of some kind.

363
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,281
Maybe we should
think about rehab.

364
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:26,383
We should hit rehab
as soon as possible.
Pretty soon.

that we could have your jobs.

our hookers, okay?
So you can't have 'em.

-but we need money to buy crack.
-oh, I'm sorry.

they could have our jobs?

Why don't we go on inside where
it's nice and warm and we can
