1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,481
<i>Let us gather. Please, gather for me.</i>

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:03,869
- Please.
- We're gathered.

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,737
Okay, so, now that you've gathered,

4
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,873
I know that a lot has been on your minds

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,208
these last couple weeks
since I've been back.

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,895
Burning questions about
my personal life, yeah.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,763
I was gone. Now I'm back.

8
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,698
That's been confusing for you.
It's been overwhelming.

9
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,767
The whole thing has been
overwhelming for you.

10
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:21,770
And you've danced around
the topic for a while now

11
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,905
out of respect for my privacy.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,706
And I-I really do appreciate that,

13
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,775
but I would like for you all
to know that I am ready now,

14
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,761
and I think it's time to
open it up to questions.

15
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:34,790
Now, don't hold back, guys.
You can ask me anything.

16
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,801
Really. All those questions
that you've got for me

17
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,805
about what's going on,
go ahead and ask them to me now.

18
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,026
You want to ask me

19
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,094
if I'm gonna stay or if I'm gonna go.

20
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:49,965
- I don't care. Do you care?
- I mean, it doesn't really...

21
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,868
I may go back. Yeah.

22
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,771
- Okay.
- Hmm.

23
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,774
So, you guys want to ask me
questions about my family.

24
00:00:58,793 --> 00:00:59,975
- I don't.
- Yeah. Hey, listen,

25
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,447
sometimes it's best to raise
a family from a distance.

26
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,455
And that's what I've decided to do, okay?

27
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,689
And I'm not the first man
in history to ever do it.

28
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:07,866
- All right, dude.
- Okay. - Good, good, good.

29
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,201
Okay, so, if we're gonna sit here,

30
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,737
and you guys are gonna insist
on asking me personal questions,

31
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,071
then be serious.

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,873
All right? L-Look, look,

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,768
so, if all of you are done
with your stupid questions,

34
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:19,482
okay, then I have a question to ask.

35
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:21,162
I want to know, where is it?

36
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:23,733
- Where's what?
- Where's what? Where's what?

37
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:24,899
Where's my car, man?

38
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:26,835
Where's my Range Rover?

39
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,971
I'm sure you guys, like,
stashed it somewhere safely,

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,482
you know, in my absence.
And that's cool. I get it.

41
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,041
But now I want it back,
so where-where is it?

42
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:35,060
We didn't move you car.
It's right where you left it.

43
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,866
Goddamn it.

44
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,803
_

45
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,131
I got to tell you, guys,
that Range Rover,

46
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,000
that was... that was like a part of me.

47
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,803
You know, I considered it
part of my identity, really.

48
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,205
So it's-it's almost like
a piece of me is gone now.

49
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,741
I mean, you guys wouldn't really understand

50
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:23,892
'cause you've never owned a vehicle.

51
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,827
- We own vehicles.
- Yeah? Name one.

52
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:28,697
Well, we had those matching
Mongoose bikes back in the day.

53
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,964
Yeah. And I felt like a piece of me was gone

54
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,100
- when they got stolen.
- Oh, that's right.

55
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,101
- So it's not like I can't relate.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,769
Dude, I wonder
if they have bikes around here.

57
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,037
- Something like that.
- They don't have bikes.

58
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,774
- What are...?
- She's a beaut, right?

59
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,908
How can I help?

60
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,727
Yeah, no, she's cool. She's cool.

61
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,797
Sort of lacks the original's,
uh, masculinity and beefiness,

62
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,064
you know, but there's a grace to it

63
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,933
that I-I think I could probably work with.

64
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,870
That being said,
do you guys have any '93 models?

65
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,139
We don't keep anything
before 2015 on the lot.

66
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,007
Oh. Well, that sucks.

67
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,760
Uh, well, I'll take...
I'll take this one, then.

68
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:59,161
Uh, it's-it's great,

69
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,896
and I'm gonna drive it
straight out of the showroom.

70
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,097
So go ahead and open up those big doors

71
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,766
or however the hell you
get these cars in there.

72
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,902
- Open those up.
- Well, sir, we need to talk financing first.

73
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,971
- Come on.
- Yes, yes. Um, oh, yeah.

74
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,906
Here-Here's my guy here.
You're gonna want to talk to him

75
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,841
- about financing.
- You never bought me a Range Rover.

76
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,794
All I got were shit cars,
which you guys crashed,

77
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,995
and you certainly never reimbursed me.

78
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,797
Yeah, yeah, quit your squawking, Dee.

79
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,732
Hey, uh, Frank,
this guy needs to talk financing.

80
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:21,934
- This is the one I'm gonna get here.
- Ooh.

81
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,068
Very nice. Here you go, Dennis.

82
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,204
- Yeah, all right.
- That's for you.

83
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,871
- There you go.
- Yeah.

84
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,891
- Uh, what is this, Frank?
- That's $473.

85
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,094
That's the Kelley Blue
Book value of your car.

86
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,828
- Hmm.
- Okay.

87
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:34,963
Yeah, that-that's not gonna be

88
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,965
nearly enough to pay-pay
for the down payment

89
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,767
on this, on this car here, so...

90
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,044
- No?
- Uh, is it?

91
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:40,845
Uh, no.

92
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:41,903
Come on, man. What are you doing here?

93
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,105
Why did you do this?

94
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:45,107
I came here to buy myself a Range Rover.

95
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:47,142
In fact, that's the one I'd like.

96
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,994
- It's a beauty. Look at that.
- Hmm. Yeah.

97
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,996
And-and I'm gonna pay full price,

98
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,797
so take it out of there, please.

99
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,998
- Thank you very much. Yeah.
- Fantastic.

100
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,200
That's right. It feels so good.

101
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,870
I haven't bought myself a new car in ages.

102
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,871
- I just need to see a driver's license.
- Okay, yeah.

103
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,072
I got it. Right here. Absolutely.

104
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,693
There you are.

105
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,760
Uh, sir, I'm afraid I can't sell you

106
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,162
- this vehicle, either.
- Why not?

107
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:10,065
- Your driver's license is expired.
- Since when?

108
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,836
1984.

109
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,939
- Whoo!
- Yeah, man.

110
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:26,293
Dork.

111
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,670
Jump this manhole.

112
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,071
Nice.

113
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:35,861
Oh, still got the skid.

114
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,209
- Oh!
- Radical.

115
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,895
Bro, bro, I feel like a carefree, young kid

116
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,030
on a bike again, man.
World at my fingertips.

117
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,166
Yeah! Me, too.

118
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:45,167
Why did we stop riding these things

119
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,102
- in the first place?
- You don't remember?

120
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,837
Dude, Shawn Dumont and their buddies,

121
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:49,971
they stole our bikes.

122
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,806
Shawn Dumont. That's right.

123
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,974
- What an asshole.
- Yeah.

124
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,192
Do you remember what he said to us

125
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,860
when we went back to get them?

126
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:57,729
"What are you gonna do about it?"

127
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,932
What are you gonna do about it.
And what can you say to that?

128
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:00,999
That's, like, the perfect line.

129
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,067
Yeah! Well, you just got to walk away,

130
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,001
'cause it's the end of the conversation.

131
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,802
It ends all conversations.

132
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:06,672
You know, I'm starting
to think that Dennis was right.

133
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,874
It's like what you ride is your identity.

134
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,026
It-It's like who you are. It's like, this,
this feels like who I am.

135
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,028
And so Shawn Dumont didn't
just steal our bikes.

136
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,898
- He stole our identity.
- Cool bikes.

137
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:17,900
Oh.

138
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,834
Hey, thanks, man. Uh...

139
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,703
your bike's really cool, too.

140
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:22,904
I know it is.

141
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,773
You guys look like you're 40.

142
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:26,842
- Well, we are 40.
- Do you have

143
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,861
the same bike as your boyfriend? Gay!

144
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,130
Oh, well, well, I am gay,
but he's not my boyfriend,

145
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,932
- 'cause I could do much better than him.
- Really?

146
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,867
- Then why don't you, Mac?
- It's difficult out there.

147
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:36,869
You guys will understand when you get older.

148
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,870
Oh, don't push your agenda on them.

149
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,739
I'm not pushing an agenda.
I'm just saying statistically

150
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,007
- at least one of them...
- You guys suck.

151
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,060
- Ah, that's...
- That's... Yeah.

152
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:46,828
Well, look, we don't mean to bug you.

153
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,829
We'll-we'll be on our way.

154
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:49,097
Yeah, we don't want any trouble.

155
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,899
- So, uh, Mac, find a hole.
- Oh, okay.

156
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:52,768
- Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Sorry. Go, go, go.

157
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,269
Go. Go. Go, Charlie, go!

158
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,792
Hey-ho. Look alive.

159
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:01,993
Snuck up on you there, huh?

160
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,128
Yeah, she's quiet. She's quiet.

161
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,065
But that's a virtue. Stealth.
You know what I mean?

162
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,801
Yeah. You know, personally,
I never saw myself

163
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,136
in an economy car, but I got to tell you,

164
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,138
it's got its advantages. Yeah.

165
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,873
Yeah, so, I've been gone for a while.

166
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,759
I'm sure you noticed.

167
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,828
But now I'm back on the scene, you know?
Doing my rounds.

168
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:23,765
See where the housewives are posted up.
Have a good time.

169
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,903
You know, do me a favor,
keep it out front for me,

170
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:27,085
because I don't think I'm gonna... Oh.

171
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,039
Probably doesn't speak English.

172
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,107
Hey-ho.

173
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,192
What up, ding-dong?

174
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,194
Whoa, what is this? W-What am I seeing?

175
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,930
Oh, what, you like my new beast?

176
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,265
- How are you in this car?
- Well, it's Frank's car.

177
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,201
But, uh, until he gets his license back,

178
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,869
it's mine. I'm gonna drive it.

179
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,271
I just got to drop him off
where he needs to go.

180
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,072
Just dropped him off at driver's ed.

181
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,207
And I got to tell you, Dennis.

182
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,059
I get why you want to be a Range Rover man.

183
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,061
You know,
it's kind of like you're up on a throne,

184
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,197
a-and you-you're looking down
on all the minions, you know?

185
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,850
- Very powerful. Yeah. Oh.
- Right. Right. Right.

186
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,936
- Thank you. You just, uh, keep it out front.
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:02,720
Don't bother. He doesn't speak English.

188
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,072
Of course, ma'am.

189
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,141
- Thank you.
- No, I mean, he didn't spe... He doesn't, um...

190
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:08,092
- Huh?
- I'm-I'm saying he doesn't, I'm saying he...

191
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,028
- What were you saying?
- He doesn't always speak English.

192
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,971
Sometimes he's...
I come here a lot, so, yeah.

193
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,834
Uh, anyway, you want to hear
something that's really cool?

194
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,168
- All right.
- I drove all the way here

195
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,104
and barely used an ounce of gas.

196
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,108
Now, that is both economically
and environmentally responsible.

197
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,726
- So...
- Excuse me.

198
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,061
Is that the 2018?

199
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,863
Oh, it most certainly is.

200
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,666
I was just telling my friend Brenda here

201
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,999
that she needs to upgrade.

202
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,003
- She is still driving a 2013.
- All right.

203
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,264
Oh.

204
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:38,206
Are you loving it? I mean, just loving it?

205
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:40,958
I tell you what, I am loving it.
And Brenda, you got to upgrade,

206
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,827
you stupid bitch. Okay?
Don't be a dumb idiot.

207
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,967
- Oh, you are fun.
- Eh.

208
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,835
- Would you like to join us for lunch?
- Oh, yes.

209
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,970
Uh, you know, ladies,

210
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,171
you know,
while we're on the subject of cars,

211
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,107
um, I actually drove here
in a Prius today...

212
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,241
Oh, so you don't have a Range Rover.

213
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,993
Uh, well, no.

214
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,995
- I just said I have a Prius...
- No? Okay.

215
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,571
Then why are we talking to you?

216
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:06,768
- Come on.
- Oh, my gosh.

217
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,031
So when you come to a four-way stop,

218
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,898
who has the right of way?

219
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,900
Okay, what you want to do is,

220
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,770
you want to lurch into the intersection.

221
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,104
It's like, kind of like a game of chicken.

222
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,840
You lurch, and then you lurch,
you lurch some more,

223
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,793
and whoever doesn't flinch gets to go first.

224
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,862
Mr. Reynolds,
if you would just look at the book.

225
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,131
Well, e-excuse me, in all due respect,

226
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,068
but this book does not have the
real rules of the road in here.

227
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:42,871
There's nothing in this
book about the Asians.

228
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,206
You can't be PC

229
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,142
on the road and expect to live.

230
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,810
You will die.

231
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,162
You go to a four-way stop,

232
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,165
and you think the rules of
the road are going to apply

233
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:57,101
to an 80-year-old Asian woman,
you're going to get blasted.

234
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,037
Right. Well, we are out of time

235
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,838
for today. I urge you all

236
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,092
to study what's in the book and
not listen to this man here.

237
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,996
Bruh, that shit was hilarious.

238
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,799
You're gonna fail so hard, man.

239
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,801
I can't afford to fail. I ca...

240
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,136
- You mind if I cheat off you?
- Yeah, maybe.

241
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,871
- Yeah.
- What's in it for me?

242
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:17,872
I'll buy you a case of beer.

243
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,874
Nah, I never get carded.

244
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,208
Cigs? Weed? Blow?

245
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,093
Nah, I'm in high school, man.
I can get all that shit.

246
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,962
- How about porno? Yeah.
- Porno?

247
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,163
Dude, I've got a phone.

248
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,031
I've been looking at porno
since I was, like, ten.

249
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,833
No, I'm talking about the real thing.

250
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,768
- The real shit?
- Yeah, the real deal.

251
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,170
- All right.
- Yeah?

252
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,789
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

253
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:38,669
Hey, man.

254
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:39,861
- Whoa.
- How's it going?

255
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,729
Wha-What are you doing?

256
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:44,666
Oh. I'm John. Aren't you my Uber?

257
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,135
Am-am I your Uber? No, I...

258
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,004
Oh, okay. Okay.

259
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,873
Yeah, I think I see
what's happening here.

260
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,075
Yeah, no, no, I'm-I'm not your Uber,
I'm not your ride.

261
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:55,760
- Oh, God.
- So, yeah.

262
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,230
Yeah, so why don't you...
um, why don't you get out?

263
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,899
Yeah, sorry, man. Nice car, by the way.

264
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,034
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, no, it is a...

265
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,036
It is a nice car, isn't it? Yeah.

266
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,905
Yeah, nothing to be ashamed of.

267
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,368
Not at all. It's very sensible.

268
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,842
I Uber 'cause I drive this old piece of shit

269
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,993
that gets no mileage, so...

270
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,659
Ah. Yeah.

271
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,997
- Hey, John, was it?
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,733
That's a strong economy name.

273
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,069
You know, it says so much,
yet it says so little.

274
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:23,804
- Hmm.
- Yeah, you got a good economy face on you, too.

275
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,139
- What?
- Eh.

276
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,942
Hey, man, I got to get going.

277
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,759
I have some friends from my
fantasy league coming over,

278
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,895
- so I should find my ride.
- Hey, I like sports, too.

279
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,831
Yeah, I do, but I've never

280
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,900
really engaged with the
fantasy element of it.

281
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,034
- No? Oh, it's the best.
- No.

282
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,237
And daily fantasy makes every game matter.

283
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,239
- Huh.
- You get way more bang for your buck.

284
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,841
Ah. Well, that's economical.

285
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,727
I... You know what? That makes total sense.

286
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:48,796
I think I'm, I think
I'm starting to understand now.

287
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,932
It always seemed foolish to me before,

288
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,266
but this economy car has got me thinking

289
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:55,136
I could enjoy economy activities.

290
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:57,873
You know what, John. Cancel your ride.

291
00:10:58,966 --> 00:10:59,907
I'll drive you to your fantasy.

292
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,092
Thanks, man.

293
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,028
- Yeah.
- Huh.

294
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:07,429
Aw, dude, when was the last time
we bought baseball cards, man?

295
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:08,900
I don't know, but it's fun, dude,

296
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,769
and it's also, like,
a great investment, right?

297
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,103
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got a Chuck Knoblauch!

298
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,518
- That's, like, pre-yips, man.
- Pre-yips?

299
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:15,774
- Yeah.
- That could be worth a fortune!

300
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,792
Yeah, it's gonna be worth a lot, man.
He was good.

301
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,794
- Goddamn.
- See, this is what I feel like we missed out on.

302
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,996
Like-like our whole lives
could've been different

303
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:22,797
if those bikes weren't stolen, you know?

304
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,999
Yeah, I know.

305
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,936
Wait. Where's your bike?

306
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,938
Ah, shit.

307
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:34,759
Yeah, bro, I don't know if I'm down

308
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,027
for whatever you got planned out here.

309
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,828
- I mean...
- No, no. Here you go.

310
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,030
- What the hell is...?
- This is, this is it.

311
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,032
This is it. This is it.
This is where I kept it.

312
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,167
Check this out. Huh?

313
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,970
Check this out.<i> Trésor.</i>

314
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,172
- Check this out. Yeah.
<i>- Trésor?</i>

315
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,240
Look at this. Look at that.

316
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,926
<i>Skank.</i> Hold on to that.

317
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,796
- Look at this.<i> Score.</i>
- Okay, but...

318
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,865
- Look at it. This is...
- Brah, I-I thought, I thought

319
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,132
you was gonna get me laid, all right?

320
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,801
- That would have been lit.
- Huh? Well, this is just...

321
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,803
- This shit's just weird as hell.
- Well, no...

322
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,004
- I mean, the plastic bags? Come on, man.
- Well, the...

323
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,807
Look, my-my boy Dennis
is tight with the girls.

324
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,826
He's gonna get you laid,
but you got to help me pass that test.

325
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,096
Here, check this out. Look at that. Ooh!

326
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,897
- Oh, yeah. Hey, hey. No, no.
- Huh? That's nice. Wait, wait.

327
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,165
Hold that up.
I want to get it for my Instagram story.

328
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,034
Yeah, that was good. That was good.
Here you go, here you go.

329
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,103
- Check this out. Ho!
- Oh!

330
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,838
This shit's weird as hell, man.

331
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:21,973
Yeah.

332
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:27,332
I mean, sure, it feels a little fast.

333
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,729
And at first I thought it was
'cause I had the newest model,

334
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:29,998
but that's not it.

335
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,800
They recognize me for who I really am.

336
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,068
You know, my true identity.

337
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,003
They, uh, invited me

338
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:36,871
to Turks and Caicos for Karen's birthday

339
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:38,402
on a private jet.

340
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,093
That's when I was like,
"Okay, well, which one is it?

341
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,162
Turks or Caicos?
'Cause I'm not invited back on Caicos."

342
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,135
Why aren't you laughing?

343
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,972
No. Well, you probably don't speak English.

344
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,907
I speak English. It's just not funny.

345
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:58,993
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

346
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,862
Deandra, that massage was everything.

347
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:02,864
- Was it?
- Ah. We deserve it.

348
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,799
- Mm.
- At least I do.

349
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,068
I just wish my second husband
came with a dimmer switch.

350
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:09,203
I forgot how much energy
men in their 20s have.

351
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,888
Oh.

352
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:13,808
Karen upgraded.
Her first husband was, like, 70.

353
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,126
- Mm.
- Now she's got a boy toy

354
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,161
with five percent body fat. Yum.

355
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,080
Karen, you dog.

356
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,965
But his brain is the size of a pea,

357
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,767
- so conversations are like pulling teeth.
- Hmm.

358
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,102
You don't have to worry about these things

359
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,970
- 'cause you've never been married.
- That's true.

360
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,206
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

361
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,127
Oh, Karen, you bitch.

362
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:36,931
You dumb idiot. You stupid savage.

363
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,201
You're not the alpha here,
you crusty-ass fool.

364
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,805
Oh, I'm gonna cuck you so hard.

365
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,941
Your boy toy... he's mine.

366
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,027
I will destroy you.

367
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,897
I am a 2018 Range Rover woman.

368
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,899
I am a golden goddess.

369
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,901
Who are you, idiot?

370
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,103
Savage!

371
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,204
Idiot!

372
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,708
Yo, yo, Den dog, we're here. Hey.

373
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:05,773
Hey, Frankie.

374
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:06,194
- Hey, how you doing?
- What's up? Hey.

375
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,929
- Hey, thanks for inviting us.
- Yeah.

376
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,998
Hey, uh, listen, everybody,
this is my friend Frank

377
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,000
- and his, uh... friend. His-his, uh...
- Hey.

378
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,001
- ...young friend.
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,202
- Thanks for inviting us. Yeah.
- Make yourself at home.

380
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,872
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. Uh,

381
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,073
what do you think, guys?
It's pretty great, right?

382
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,742
John's got a pretty nice setup.

383
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:21,959
You know, he's got great Wi-Fi, too,

384
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,762
which is great for playing fantasy sports.

385
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,029
We're-we're doing a little
fantasy baseball right now.

386
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,898
Is this the dude you're talking about?

387
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,833
Uh, yeah. Mm, yeah.

388
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,167
Don't embarrass me, man.

389
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,836
- I'm not embarrassing you.
- Dennis.

390
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:32,870
- This place is weak, bro.
- Oh.

391
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,105
- Bro.
- It's not... no, not weak.

392
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:36,774
Who is...? Yeah. Not weak, guy.

393
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,192
You know, these guys,
they-they totally get it.

394
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:39,927
You know what I mean? Hey, look.

395
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,195
They work hard,
but they play hard, you know.

396
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,197
They play fantasy hard, too.

397
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:45,200
- Yeah. I really want to show you this lineup I...
- Dennis?

398
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,201
At least hit on the one chick that's here.

399
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,238
Oh. Uh, no.
That's-that's Tara, and I think, uh...

400
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:53,207
I think John's got a little
bit of a thing for her, so...

401
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,892
You lose your mojo?

402
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,385
I didn't lose my mojo.

403
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,029
- I still got my...
- Yeah, you got it.

404
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,697
- You got the moves?
- I got my mojo.

405
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,965
- I said you-you...
- What are you doing?

406
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,562
Uh, Insta story.

407
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:03,663
- Kids.
- Cool.

408
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,170
- What is it?
- It's video, bro.

409
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:09,040
Uh, okay. What do I do?
Like, should I do, like, a thing, or...?

410
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,141
Oh, this dude sucks.

411
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,194
What are you doing, man?
I don't suck. Dude, I'll suck you.

412
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,129
- You'll suck me?
- No, that's...

413
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,998
- That's not what I meant.
- Oh, that's perfect, man.

414
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,800
What are you,
what are you gonna do with that, dude?

415
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:20,068
- Don't put that out in the world.
- Go, go, go, go.

416
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,202
- Go hit on the girl, will you?
- Yeah.

417
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,937
- I'll show you what sucks, huh?
- Let's go. Let's see it.

418
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,805
- I'll hit on Tara, man. You'll see.
- I want to watch. Let's go.

419
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,940
- Who is this guy?
- Come on.

420
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,041
- Come watch this. Watch this.
- All right. All right.

421
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:29,827
Yo.

422
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,829
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

423
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,965
Um, oh, cooking.
You... What is that, chili? Cool.

424
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,901
- Yeah.
- Did you make enough for everybody?

425
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,103
- Yeah, you want some?
- Oh, no. It makes me... makes me fart.

426
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:42,907
I don't want to,
I don't want to fart right now.

427
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:46,194
Um... I noticed you were wearing a hat,

428
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:47,995
and that's... that's pretty cool.

429
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,997
Like, I don't see a lot of,
like, girls wearing hats,

430
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,800
you know, and I'm wearing a hat,
too, you know.

431
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,267
It's like, it's like we're...

432
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:54,659
It's like we're hat twins.

433
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:57,071
You know what I mean? Yeah.

434
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,273
And I-I have a twin.

435
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,075
I mean, I am a twin. Like, I'm part...

436
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,827
I'm one part of a twin. Uh...

437
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,029
I have a twin sister,
is what I'm trying to say.

438
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,764
Mm.

439
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,801
Yeah, she farts a shit ton, man.

440
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,172
Yeah. I-I don't have that.

441
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,173
Like, everything makes her...

442
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,992
everything makes her fart.

443
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,794
- I'm gonna get back in there.
- Yeah.

444
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:20,862
- Yeah.
- The Minnesota Twins.

445
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:23,798
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, they're a team.

446
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,497
Mm.

447
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:29,938
It was pretty cool.

448
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,773
We're gonna hit the road. Uh...

449
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:32,674
- Are you guys gonna take off?
- Yeah, we're gonna

450
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:33,741
- take off.
- Be good though, bro.

451
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,026
- Word. Word.
- See you, man.

452
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,827
Look, just pedal faster.

453
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,896
I'm going as fast as I can, bro.
You tacked on

454
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,765
- a little too much mass, I think.
- Don't blame this on me, dude.

455
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,166
- Are you doing the leg routine I gave you?
- I'm so tired

456
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,968
- of doing your routines, man.
- Are you drinking the Fight Milk?

457
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,169
It makes me so sick!

458
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,038
- There it is!
- Oh, shit! That<i> is</i> it!

459
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,239
- Hey!
- Hey, punks!

460
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,775
That's our bike.

461
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,993
Well, it's ours now.

462
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:53,794
What are you gonna do about it?

463
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,262
- Listen, you little piece of shit. I'm gonna...
- Yo, whoa!

464
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:57,264
Hey! The hell is this?

465
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,067
What are you doing? You yelling at my kid?

466
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,801
- Uh, thank you for coming out, sir.
- You all right?

467
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:04,431
Uh, I believe that your son
and his friends stole a bike.

468
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,835
I'm sorry, Stephen stole your son's bike?

469
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,209
- Uh, no. He stole our bike.
- Let me talk to my son.

470
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,761
- Let's see if we can get down to it, okay?
- Okay. Okay. Thank you.

471
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,030
- Dude, do you know who that is?
- No.

472
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,964
That's Shawn Dumont,
who stole our bike in seventh grade.

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,921
- That's him.
- That's Shawn Dumont?

474
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:16,968
- Holy shit, you're right.
- I know. He got fat as shit, man.

475
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,169
I almost didn't recognize him.

476
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,970
Y-You know what, dude, I don't even care.

477
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,040
I just want to get my bike and let's just go

478
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,241
- and have fun.
- Let's just get back to it. All right.

479
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,793
Let's not get tripped up by that.

480
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,062
Okay, good news. He didn't steal it.

481
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,864
- What? Uh, yeah, he did. It's-it's right there.
- Yeah.

482
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,198
I'm looking at it. You want to take a look?

483
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:33,134
No, no. He says he didn't steal it.

484
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,136
And, you know, he didn't steal it.

485
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,937
- Okay?
- Well, no, that is definitely our bike,

486
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,841
- a-and we want it back, okay?
- Yeah, we want it back.

487
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,195
What are you gonna do about it?

488
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,934
Uh... uh...

489
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,203
- Nothing, yeah.
- Nothing.

490
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,205
- Yeah. That's what I thought.
- Damn it.

491
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,207
- Dude, it's the perfect line, dude.
There's no coming back... - Yeah.

492
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,125
- ...from that.
- It's just like, when you say it,

493
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,827
it just ends the whole thing.

494
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,961
Damn it.

495
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,853
I can't believe this happened again.

496
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:04,227
Son of a bitch.

497
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:16,260
- Dee!
- Hey.

498
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:18,997
What a nice surprise.
I wasn't expecting you. You know,

499
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,866
- I was just telling Brenda about my new bed linens.
- Oh.

500
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,735
Egyptian cotton.

501
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:25,069
1,000 thread count. You got to see them.

502
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,738
Oh, I-I've seen them.

503
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,940
I've seen them real up close and personal.

504
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,742
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

505
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,028
This spinster spun a web that
swallowed your boy toy up whole.

506
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,829
I am a goddess.

507
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,964
Okay, I'm having a hard time
following what you're...

508
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,701
I am a golden goddess, you idiot.

509
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,703
Savage idiots!

510
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,906
And I banged your man.

511
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:49,727
Aidan!

512
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,995
Where the hell were you?

513
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,863
The test was this morning!

514
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,066
- I failed<i> so</i> hard!
- Dude,

515
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,135
my mom saw the Instagram
with all the porn and shit.

516
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,137
She said no phone privileges and no license.

517
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,672
I'm-I'm grounded, bro.

518
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,608
Aw! Moms are so not lit.

519
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,960
Hey, but, yo, I did get laid last night.

520
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,161
- That's lit.
- Yeah.

521
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,962
Get out!
- Who's the alpha now,

522
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:11,765
- huh, Karen?
- Get off my property, bitch!

523
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,767
How could you have done this to me?

524
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,970
- Frank?
- Deandra, what the hell are you doing here?

525
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,105
Oh, my God. You're the creepy old man

526
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:20,107
from Aidan's Instagram stories.

527
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,792
Aidan and I are study buddies.

528
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,797
Your husband's taking driver's ed?
Well, I tell you what,

529
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,798
I showed him how to drive stick last night.

530
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,666
Aidan's my son!

531
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:30,801
What's that?

532
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,136
What's up, Dee?

533
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,938
- Oh...
- Brenda,

534
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,940
- call the police. Now.
- No, no. - All right.

535
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,675
- Um... Oh, my God.
- B-Bye-bye. Let's go.

536
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,959
- Get out of here. Keys?
- That's right. Go.

537
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,828
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes, dude.

538
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,624
Shawn Dumont is an asshole.

539
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,438
He stole our bikes and
he stole our identities.

540
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,700
I can't believe he's getting away
with this, man.

541
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,701
You know what?
We got to do what we should've done

542
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,510
- 30 years ago.
- Yes. Yes.

543
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,705
- You're right.
- You ready?

544
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:51,906
Yeah. Shawn Dumont. That prick.

545
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:54,708
- Son of a bitch.
- That goddamn prick.

546
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,993
Yo, I'm gonna steal my dad's vape pen.

547
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,702
I know where he hides that shit.

548
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:58,930
Hey, you.

549
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,061
- Dennis.
- Oh, boy.

550
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,931
It has been a long-ass day.
It is definitely beer o'clock.

551
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,933
- What's up?
- There is always Coors

552
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,735
- in the garage fridge, bro.
- Oh.

553
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:38,738
Clutch!

554
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,172
What's up?

555
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:54,001
Jonathan!

556
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,106
What's up?

557
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,041
What is this?

558
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:01,726
What am I seeing?

559
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,928
This is that gas guzzler I was mentioning.

560
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,729
- Oh.
- I don't know.

561
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,640
I think I'm gonna donate
it to the fire department

562
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:08,733
- or something.
- C-Can...

563
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,133
can I...

564
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,869
c-can I purchase it from...

565
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,137
I will purchase it from you.

566
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,940
The Blue Book value,
I'll-I'll give you double.

567
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:17,974
Deal.

568
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,962
- Be gone from me now.
- What?

569
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,964
Be gone from me, you soy boy beta cuck.

570
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,766
The transaction is complete.

571
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:27,685
Dennis, I don't understand.

572
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,770
