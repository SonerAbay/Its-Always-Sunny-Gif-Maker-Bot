What'd you put in there?

12
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:24,507
Oh, man, we just put a bunch of
stuff in here that we thought

13
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:26,710
would be valuable one day,
like, uh, let's see, we got a

Gregg Jeffries baseball card.

It wasn't valuable then.

Uh, we got a Korn CD.

18
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,683
Uh, we got a copy of Cider
House Rules on laser disc.

19
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,251
Don't know why we thought
that would be valuable.

20
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,186
That's a collector's item.

21
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:37,721
That's gonna be very... Be
very careful with that.

22
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,689
Oh, my God, you guys, this is
a letter to my future self.

23
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:40,557
What?!

24
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,959
Yeah. "Dear future Dee,
How's Hollywood?

Congrats on all of your success.

Stay grounded.

27
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:48,231
Enclosed is a check for
one million dollars.

Be sure to give it to Dr.
Larry Myers as a thank you for all of

29
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:51,968
his inspiration."

30
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:52,969
Is this stupid?

31
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:53,803
This is just stupid.

32
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,938
Who's Dr. Larry Myers?

33
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,239
Nobody. Doesn't matter.

34
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:57,907
Just my high school drama teacher.

35
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,775
This is just... it's dumb.

36
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:01,111
Like, why would we put such
stupid stuff in here, and also

37
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,546
we bur-buried it, and then we
opened it ten years later?

38
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,548
What, are you supposed to just,
oh, bury it, open right up, and

39
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:07,650
not give yourself any time to
fulfill any kind of dreams or...

40
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:08,518
The whole thing's dumb.

41
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:09,753
Like, Cider House Rules?

42
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,488
Okay.

43
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:12,422
Hormones.

44
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:13,830
She's all worked out.

45
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,230
It's the fattening.

46
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,242
What else is in there?

47
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,029
Uh, oh!

48
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:19,729
Old pictures! Old pictures!

49
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:20,730
Pictures!

50
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:21,731
Holy shit, look at that!

51
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,732
Look!

52
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,867
The gang.

53
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:24,901
Whew.

54
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,002
Who's this jag-off?

55
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,770
Look.

56
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,171
Oh, that's Schmidty!

57
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,005
Schmidty!

58
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:30,607
He was the fourth member of our crew.

59
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,275
There was another member of the gang?

60
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:32,942
Oh, yeah, dude.

61
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,643
I miss him, dude.

62
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:35,545
Why did we ditch him in the first place?
I can't remember.

63
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:36,146
I don't know.

64
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,747
Eh, he wasn't a good fit.

65
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,315
Remember? You know?

66
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:40,717
Kind of got on our nerves.

67
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:41,684
He didn't get on my nerves.

68
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,794
No, he never got on my nerves.
I actually really loved that guy.

69
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:44,641
You know what, I remember now.

70
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,291
Charlie soured on him, and then
he, like, gave us an ultimatum.

71
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:48,925
You remember?

72
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:51,828
And then we all turned on th guy pretty quickly...
I mean, we all agreed he was

73
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,697
out of the... You pushed him out
of a moving car and yelled

74
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:56,099
"You're out of the gang!"

75
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,201
Now, in hindsight, that
does seem a little rash.

76
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:00,336
Yeah, it was a bit of a snap decision.

77
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:03,106
Why don't you call this Schmidty guy
up and see what he's up to now?

78
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,108
You know, I do feel like
we owe the guy an apology.

79
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:07,110
Yeah. You know what, I'd
love to see Schmidty.

80
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:07,777
I would, too.

81
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,913
Yeah, but that's a bad
snap decision, you know?

82
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,614
Like, there's a reason
he didn't work out.

83
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,683
We got a good thing going
on now without him.

84
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,652
We don't need a new
member of the gang.

85
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,586
Don't get Schmidty.

86
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:17,620
Don't get Schmidty.

87
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:32,408
 

88
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,390
I'm really *** to meet this guy.

89
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,326
Oh, he was the coolest.
Seriously.

90
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,489
Oh...

91
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,649
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,834
Mrs. Schmidt, it's it's Dennis.

93
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,514
And Mac. You remember us, right?

94
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,529
We're looking for Schmidty. He around?

95
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,814
He's dead.

96
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:12,331
Oh, gosh, that is too bad.
We're sorry for your loss.

97
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,771
Hiyah!

98
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,252
What's up bitches?

99
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:17,700
That's Schmidty?

100
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,799
Hey, we thought that you were dead.

101
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,437
- He made me say it.
- I made you say it. listen to you, mom.

102
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,564
You seen that shit?

103
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:27,669
He jumped down a whole
flight of stairs.

104
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,471
I didn't see you down there, Chuckles.

105
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,539
How you been, little man?

106
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:31,773
Not that little, you know?

107
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,641
Regular size.

108
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,076
Maybe he, but...
Not anymore.

109
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:35,977
Put on a few LB's since
I saw you last, huh?

110
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:36,511
No. Same weight.

111
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,379
Same weight I always been.

112
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,414
Yeah, no, he put on a lot of weight.

113
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:40,449
No, you tacked on weight.

114
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,317
I tacked on mass, muscle mass.

115
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:43,785
Who's this old son of a bitch?

116
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:44,286
I'm Frank.

117
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:44,786
Frank?

118
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:45,287
Frank.

119
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:45,854
I'm Schmidty.

120
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:46,688
Nice to... put her there.

121
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:47,556
No!

122
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:49,424
Don't kiss him.

123
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:52,094
Hey, uh, so what brings
you dicks here, huh?

124
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:56,898
Oh, well, Schmidty, um, honestly, we
came around here because we, um...

125
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,233
Go ahead.

126
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,202
...want to say we're
sorry, Schmidty.

127
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:02,871
Yeah, yeah, we... Can
you take this, Mac?

128
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:03,772
Yeah, man, I got this.

129
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,141
Hey, man, we just want to say
we're sorry for icing you out in

130
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,809
the past, and we'd
like your forgiveness.

131
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:08,910
Yeah.

132
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,346
Get on your knees and ask.

133
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:12,080
Excuse me?

134
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:13,682
Get down on your knees and ask.

135
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,318
Show some humility, for Christ's sake.

136
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:16,985
Really?

137
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:18,220
Yeah.

138
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:18,854
Ah, man.

139
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,855
Whatever it takes, Schmidty.

140
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:20,722
Wow, you're really doing it.

141
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,423
I'm kidding.

142
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,090
Ah!

143
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:23,525
Oh, oh, he's joking!

144
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:24,192
Oh, man!

145
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,963
Come on, guys, have some dignity,
some respect for yourselves.

146
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,630
You forgive us?

147
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:29,364
Absolutely.

148
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:30,065
Classy, Schmidty.

149
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,066
Very classy.

150
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,239
Dr. Myers?

151
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:38,073
Yes?

152
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,341
Hi.

153
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,876
Dee Reynolds.

154
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,410
I was in the school musical.

155
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:43,245
Frankenstein.

156
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:44,679
Yes, of course!

157
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:45,280
Deandra Reynolds!

158
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:46,081
Yeah!

159
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,249
Sit, darling, sit.

160
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:49,117
Thank you.

161
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:54,890
Listen, I came to talk to you about high school.
I... Oh, uh...

162
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:59,528
I was drinking a lot back then, so
if I did anything inappropriate...

163
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:00,762
Oh, no, no, no.

164
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,363
Not at all.

165
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,731
In fact, the opposite.

166
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,567
You were, like, the most
inspiring teacher I had.

167
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:08,635
In fact, I-I wrote you this check
ten years ago.

168
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,631
In hopes that I can one day give it
to you, as a thank you.

169
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:15,203
May you rot in hell,

170
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:16,982
- you retched beast!
- Oh...

171
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,636
- Um, I'm confused...
- Frankenstein.

172
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,601
That's what the villagers screamed at you,
just before you

173
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,551
threw yourself at the funeral pier.
Aah.

174
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:31,696
You were such a hideous
delight in that show.

175
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:33,468
Thank you.
Yes, okay.

176
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,021
So you're saying "don't give up",

177
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:39,044
- I shouldn't give up on my dream.
- No my dear, you must give up. You must.

178
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,268
It's far too late for you.

179
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:44,020
But it's not too late to teach.

180
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,876
Come speak to the kids, inspire them.

181
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:52,180
It's an opportunity to share
your unique experiences.

182
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:52,948
Uh-huh.

183
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:58,086
The question is: Will you seize it?

184
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,856
Mm...
No, thank you.

185
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:01,890
Five...
What?

186
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,025
...four, three...
No, I just never wanted to be teaching.

187
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:05,026
two, one...
No offense.

188
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:05,660
What are you doing?

189
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:06,661
Okay, yes.

190
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,029
And there you have it!

191
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:09,731
A teacher is born.

192
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:11,885
Well...

193
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,151
Man, this is unbelievable, huh?

194
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,638
Working at a bar, running a bar?

195
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:18,540
This has got to be, like, the
greatest job ever, right?

196
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,175
It is, man, this is what we do.

197
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,676
Yeah, lot of dicking around, huh?

198
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:24,412
Hey, um, you're still, uh,
living with your mom, huh?

199
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,747
That sounds kind of lame.

200
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,950
Yeah, well, I mean, it's
the MS that's really lame.

201
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:29,551
You know?

202
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:30,385
Oh, your mom has...?

203
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:31,319
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:32,120
She's doing all right, though.

205
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,589
I moved in with her to take care
of her and stuff like that.

206
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:37,726
It's good to really get to know her
before, you know, uh, she moves on.

207
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:39,828
Oh... Kind of a downer,
that story, though.

208
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:40,528
Kind of a downer.

209
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:41,196
What about you, man?

210
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,631
What's your living
situation like these days?

211
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:43,265
What do you do?

212
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:44,032
What are you up to?

213
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,733
Uh, it's pretty sweet.

214
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,233
I am.

215
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:46,234
I'm his living situation.

216
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:47,135
Oh, yeah?

217
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:48,436
Yeah, we share a bed.

218
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:49,337
Well, not every night.

219
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:49,938
That's hilarious.

220
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:51,606
You know, Charlie and
I used to be roomies.

221
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:52,107
Yeah.

222
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:53,308
Yeah, yeah, you remember that?

223
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:55,477
Hey, you remember how you used
to try to get me to play all

224
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:59,047
those-those lame games, you know, those
weird things you'd want to do at night?

225
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,315
Like, uh, Night Crawlers.

226
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:02,302
- I play Night Crawlers all the time.
- You do?

227
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,603
Frank enjoys this game very much.

228
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,528
Correct me if I'm wrong, but to make
Night Crawlers a little bit better

229
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:08,810
you should use blankets, right?

230
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,312
You take a piece of dirt.

231
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,565
Exactly, you can use it as a force field,
or as a roaming base.

232
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:16,064
Yeah, it's kind of a good idea
cause, you know,

233
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:19,221
- it's an imagination based game.
- It's still imagination based.

234
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,256
Oh, I have an idea.

235
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:25,955
Dennis, remember you and Mac were
laughing when I did the butt dance?

236
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,184
They love that when I do it.

237
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,864
Guys, watch me, watch me, will you?

238
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:30,375
Oh, yeah!

239
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,147
5, 6, 7, 8...

240
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,310
* butt, butt, butt *

241
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,905
Oh, Charlie, no...

242
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,750
- Where is this coming from?
- This is embarrassing.

243
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:44,787
- Guys, be excited!
- Charlie, lemme see.

244
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,805
You're not having fun doing this,

245
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,552
so we're not having fun watching it, buddy.

246
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,077
Watch, it's like this, it's like

247
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,845
I don't know, something like

248
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,325
* butt, butt, butt *

249
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,895
* butt, butt, butt *

250
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:59,102
* butt! *

251
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:00,475
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

252
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:01,643
Hyah!

253
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,080
Butt dance 2.0.

254
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,481
Butt dance 2.0.

255
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:07,615
Beautiful, man.

256
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:08,717
Schmitdy, know what you got?

257
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,219
You know what you got that Charlie
doesn't really quite have?

258
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:11,886
You have that "it" factor.

259
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:12,587
You know what I'm saying?

260
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:13,288
It's charisma.

261
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:13,989
It's, like, you got it.

262
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:14,990
Hey, you guys!

263
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,926
Uh, can I talk to you in the back
office for a second real quick?

264
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:19,627
I can't believe this dude.

265
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,363
He has not changed in years, man.

266
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,264
Look, you guys need to make
a decision right now, okay?

267
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:26,234
It is either him, or it is me.

268
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:27,235
Him.

269
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:27,969
Yeah.

270
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,104
I was going to say him, too.

271
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:29,838
Yeah, him, him.

272
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,406
Yeah, you know, it's always been him.

273
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:34,175
I don't know why I
didn't see that before.

274
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,264
I'm out of the gang?

275
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,053
Him.

276
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:45,666
Him.

277
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,657
Hello, everybody.

278
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:53,624
Hi, there.

279
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:56,961
My name is Dee Reynolds, and not
only am I a professional actress

280
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,531
and comedienne, uh, but I also
used to go to school here.

281
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,266
What have you acted in?

282
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,968
A lot of... a lot.

283
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,603
I've acted in a lot of things.

284
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,739
You-you may not have seen
all of them or any of them.

285
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,575
You know, it's not time for questions.

286
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:11,781
I'll let you know when
it's time for questions, though, ok?

287
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:12,699
And the phone goes away.

288
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,675
And the phone goes into your pocket
or into your backpack,

289
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,301
but not out, in your fingers,
because I'm talking.

290
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:18,452
No, I'm a'ight.

291
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,451
Yeah, said the turkey.

292
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,719
Uh-oh.

293
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:23,187
Oh, no.

294
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:24,188
Who's she?

295
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:24,989
Who's she?

296
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:26,824
She's somebody that'll
zing you back, right?

297
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:27,658
I'll zing you.

298
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:30,394
I'll zap you, I'll zing you,
so just know that about me.

299
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:36,100
You know, I know that, uh, you guys
are 18 and you're seniors, and so...

300
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,269
Okay, what is it that they're doing?

301
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,203
What is this that they're doing?

302
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,671
Oh, they're doing
their coughing thing.

303
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:41,439
Yeah, I hear that.

304
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,573
All right, kids, settle down.

305
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:46,410
You can, uh, read, pull out
your phones, whatever.

306
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:47,845
They do love their phones.

307
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:48,779
What...? That's it?

308
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:52,550
You're just going to sit in the corner
and hem away at your sock all day?

309
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:54,418
No, where...
where is the teacher that I knew?

310
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,169
Where is that inspirational man?

311
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:01,959
My enthusiasm in those days was
fueled entirely by the alcohol.

312
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:03,794
Dee, hey!

313
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:05,196
Come here, come here.

314
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,265
Charlie, what are you...
what are you doing?

315
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,232
Got kicked out of the gang.

316
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,933
What are you up to?

317
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:09,667
You want to hang out?

318
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:10,668
No, Charlie.

319
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,569
I don't want to hang out.

320
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:12,336
I-I have a job.

321
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,906
I'm a teacher now, so I got to get
back to inspiring some students.

322
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:15,640
Oh, that's pretty sweet.

323
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,174
You want to toss some
inspiration my way, you know,

324
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,210
'cause the guys think Schmidty's
all that and, like, I'm no good?

325
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,045
Okay, Charlie, how about this?

326
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,347
You are really good at cleaning
shit out of toilets and-and

327
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,549
taking trash and throwing it
into dumpsters, so why don't you

328
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:28,119
get a new job somewhere else
doing those kinds of things and

329
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,186
make friends there, okay?

330
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,622
Okay, Dee, so are you saying
get a job here as a janitor,

331
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,524
and then you and I
can be best friends?

332
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,293
That is absolutely not
what I was saying.

333
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,894
I'm going to talk to the
principal, see if I can get that

334
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:38,496
job, and then we'll work
on the friendship thing.

335
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:39,230
Don't do that.

336
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,097
No, don't do that.

337
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:40,898
Charlie, don't do that.

338
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:41,732
Oh, Goddamn it, don't do that.

339
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,934
That... this is my thing.

340
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,268
What, what, what, what, what?

341
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:45,536
Here we go.

342
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,370
Hey, all right!

343
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,271
There's the man.

344
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,005
What's up, buddy?

345
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:48,773
This place is pretty nice.

346
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,507
Yeah.

347
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:51,670
What's going on? You guys are gonna try
and bang me afterwards or something?

348
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,143
Very nice turn you made.

349
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,243
Um, we only come here
for special occasions.

350
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,875
- Yeah.
- Good, good, what's the occasion?

351
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:04,746
Well we brought you to this luncheon, Schmidty,
because we want to make this official.

352
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,019
Mac, do you have the ring?

353
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,276
Ok, great, um...

354
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:09,083
Schmidty, we, uh...

355
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,354
We missed a lot of good, good years.

356
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:14,214
- A lot of special time...
- Yeah?

357
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:16,652
- ...with you. And...
- Thanks.

358
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:20,711
- You know what, I don't think I can do this.
- It's alright, I'll take this.

359
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:23,484
- Why is he being a big damn puss?
- Um, Schmidty...

360
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,052
- He's emotional.
- We want you back...

361
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,544
if you'll have this.

362
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,167
What the hell is this shit?

363
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:34,685
It's a sterling silver clover ring.

364
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:37,722
When we put all four of them
together, makes a four-leaf

365
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,726
clover, solidifying our
bond for all time.

366
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,828
You're kidding, though, right?

367
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:45,930
No, we've never been more
serious in our lives.

368
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:46,931
Yeah.

369
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,332
Yeah, whatever, I don't care.

370
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,166
Sure.

371
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:50,067
All right!

372
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:50,835
He said yes!

373
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:51,502
That's a yes!

374
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,503
We bagged him.

375
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:53,437
We certainly did.

376
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,405
Oh, food's here!

377
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:55,639
Food is here.

378
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:56,507
Oh, no, wait, though.

379
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:57,375
I didn't order yet.

380
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,142
Oh, that's okay.

381
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,043
I took care of the food already.

382
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,778
Yes, Dennis orders for us.

383
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,580
That is a humongous shrimp.

384
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,882
Well, it's 'cause it's not a
shrimp, Frank; it's a prawn.

385
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,051
Yeah, and I don't like prawns,
so I eat around them.

386
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,920
Well, I'll take your prawns
if you want to take my salad.

387
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:11,022
Eh.

388
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:11,822
No?

389
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,455
Okay, yeah, that's what I'll do.
Yeah, you can do that.

390
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:14,881
Just put your prawns on the salad.

391
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:15,996
Why don't you just order what you want?

392
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,189
Uh, well, Dennis kind
of has the best palate.

393
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,671
Yeah, I have the most
refined palate, Schmidty.

394
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,041
That's just how we do things now.

395
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,761
You've been away for a while.
It's fine.

396
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:24,305
No, no, that's not
what I'm going to do.

397
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,168
Excuse me.
Hey, come here really quick.

398
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,373
Um, can I get, uh...
you have linguine?

399
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,142
Yeah, can I get linguine instead?

400
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,109
And, uh, what do you guys want?

401
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,024
Order whatever you want.

402
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:34,521
Linguine's too heavy for lunch.
No, no, what do you want?

403
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,228
- I want fries.
- Fries for this guy.

404
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:36,948
I can have fries?

405
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,600
Oh, you don't like your
salad all of a sudden, Mac?

406
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:39,939
I... Dennis, I hate salad.

407
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,728
You hate salad?
Where is this coming from?

408
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:42,920
I hate this restaurant.

409
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:43,788
Yeah, this restaurant blows.

410
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:44,722
I'll have a ginger ale.

411
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,823
All right, there you go.

412
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,957
Come on, man, get into it.

413
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,325
I'm saying that now.

414
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,293
Can I say that now?

415
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,094
What?

416
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:50,995
Hyah!

417
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:51,862
Absolutely, take it.

418
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,630
It's yours.

419
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:53,664
By all means.

420
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,869
What'd you get, a ginger ale?

421
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,037
I'm a little confused.

422
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:03,541
Are you telling me that this photo
of Bruce Jenner is your résumé?

423
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,110
Well, when I showed up this
morning, I didn't have a formal

424
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:09,113
résumé on me, so I was sort
of hoping the photograph of

425
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,649
Mr. Jenner could...
could represent the standard of

426
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,751
excellence I'm hoping to
bring to this position.

427
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:16,153
I see, and you're looking for a
job as a substitute teacher?

428
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,189
Substitute janitor, all right?

429
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,291
Look, I'll clean this building
so good, you're not going to

430
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:21,258
know what to do with yourself.

431
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:22,359
You know what I mean?

432
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,561
And I'm not a proud man.

433
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:25,896
You know, I'll do the jobs that
the other guys don't want to do.

434
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:26,931
I'll degrade myself.

435
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:29,266
I'll make a genuine ass out of myself.

436
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,267
Yeah.

437
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:32,937
Hey, look, I'll swallow that eraser
whole just to prove it to you.

438
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:33,737
Uh, no, no.

439
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:34,472
Please, please, no.

440
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,272
I'll swallow it whole.

441
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,107
Oh, no, no, no, no.

442
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,209
You don't have to do that, but
I-I have to say, I don't think

443
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,144
I've ever encountered someone
who's so passionate about

444
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,612
joining our custodial staff.

445
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,434
The passion I have for the work that I
do is extraordinary.

446
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,213
It probably goes beyond janitor.

447
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,127
Uh-uh.

448
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,054
And I'm serious. I'm gonna
eat that eraser whole.

449
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,189
Oh, no, no, it's not...
it's not necessary.

450
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,724
You don't need to t the
eraser to prove your point.

451
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,758
Uh, you have the job.

452
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:55,759
Are you serious?

453
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:56,861
I love your attitude.

454
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:57,862
It's fantastic.

455
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,497
Sir, I am not going to let you down.

456
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,198
I mean, I'm going to start
cleaning immediately.

457
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:02,133
Immediately.

458
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,868
Uh, but first, can I eat the eraser?

459
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:06,737
You're saying you want
to eat the eraser?

460
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,807
Well, I'm asking you if it's edible
because it certainly smells of grapes.

461
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,142
I don't think it's edible.

462
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,343
Can I just test it?

463
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,244
I'd rather you didn't.

464
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,745
I kinda want... I might need it.

465
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,613
All right.

466
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,413
You win this one.

467
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,848
I'll pick up one of my own.

468
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,649
I'll eat that one.

469
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:19,450
That way everybody wins.

470
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,584
All right, well, welcome aboard.

471
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,320
All right, all right, thanks so much.

472
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:28,749
Ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

473
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,584
I mean, where the hell is he?

474
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:31,985
What did we say?

475
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,320
We said 3:00.

476
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:37,558
So we said 3:00, and it's, like...

477
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,692
Hyah!

478
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,461
What's crappenin', fellas?

479
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,363
Hey, Schmidty, running
kinda late there, huh?

480
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,364
Am I?

481
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:44,565
I didn't think it mattered.

482
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:45,632
How could it not matter?

483
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,369
I mean, this is the final phase
of your initiation back into

484
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:50,571
the gang, so it kinda
matters a matters a lot.

485
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,538
It actually does.

486
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:54,074
Whoa. Um, where's your ring?

487
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:54,875
Oh, come on.

488
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:57,578
You didn't want me to really
wear that thing, did ya?

489
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,580
Yeah...
Oh.

490
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:01,849
We're sort of sticklers for
that kind of thing, too.

491
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:02,916
So pop that on.

492
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:03,717
I will. Okay.

493
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:04,351
Sorry about that.

494
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:05,652
Time and ring. Good. Got it.

495
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,951
Yeah.

496
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,104
Oh! Hey, look at this!

497
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,995
Nice setup fellas.

498
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:13,894
Candles? Where did you steal
these from, huh?

499
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,496
Uh-oh!

500
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:17,431
When the hell'd you take that?

501
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,799
Don't worry about it, Schmidty.

502
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:19,867
We got to ya.

503
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,168
This is weird as hell.

504
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,936
You guys see that, right?

505
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:24,371
What's weird about this?

506
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,240
This is a men's ceremony, okay?

507
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:30,177
They have ceremonies for
all sorts of men's clubs.

508
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:32,679
Yeah, the Mafia, the
Freemasons, the White House.

509
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:34,047
The White House, they do it.

510
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:34,948
This is cool, okay?

511
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,382
Trust me, what we're
doing is very cool.

512
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,025
Okay.

513
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,109
Mack, why don't we get started?

514
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:38,948
You'll get it.

515
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,900
He'll understand as the
ceremony progresses.

516
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:43,690
All right, Schmidty, please have
a seat in the ceremonial seat.

517
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:44,591
I'll do the candles.

518
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,094
Uh, Frank, please do the candles.

519
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:48,128
Dennis, the song.

520
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:49,596
All right, the song.

521
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,239
Uh, (laughs) look at that!

522
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:01,909
All right, take it, take
it take it seriously.

523
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:02,943
I am. I'm locked in.

524
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:07,881
Okay, I will now begin the ceremony by
administering a sweet roundhouse kick

525
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,216
to the bell.

526
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:10,717
To the bell?

527
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:15,989
Uh-oh, whiff!

528
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:16,957
I just missed that.

529
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:17,991
I just missed that.

530
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:20,627
Dude, you're not even close.

531
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:23,230
No, Schmidty, this is all
part of the ceremony.

532
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,435
You gotta stretch
before this thing, huh?

533
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,269
Enjoy it.

534
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:30,871
One last crack, come on.

535
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,474
Oh, man, this is pathetic.

536
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,909
Here, dude, look, it goes
something like this.

537
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:39,079
Hyah!

538
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,853
I'm excited. I am.

539
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,722
I mean, the first part of the
ceremony was a little lame, but

540
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,191
ending it with a hot air
balloon ride, that kicks ass.

541
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,793
Yeah, yeah, all those things.

542
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:53,660
Yup.

543
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:54,094
Frank, now!

544
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:54,928
Push, Frank, push!

545
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:55,896
Go, go, go!

546
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,231
I got him. I got him.

547
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,198
Come on. Stop.

548
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,132
Get out!

549
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Come on, Frank, Frank, push him out!

550
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:02,551
What are you doing, trying to push
me out of a moving car again?

551
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:03,770
Yes.

552
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,005
Goddamn it, pull over.

553
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:06,139
Why are you doing this?

554
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,259
I'll just pull over.
Good job, Frank.

555
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:09,843
Tub of lard over here.

556
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:12,246
Give me back the ring, all right?
'Cause you don't deserve it!

557
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:13,580
- Take the ring.
- Get out of here!

558
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,781
You're out of the gang, Schmidty!

559
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,116
You're out of the gang, Schmidty!

560
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:17,284
Get out! You're out! You're out!

561
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:18,284
Okay, got it. I heard ya.
Nice seeing you guys again.

562
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,470
Very nice meeting you.

563
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,275
Get out of the car!

564
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,811
I heard you.
I'm getting out, okay?

565
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:24,569
Now, Dennis, peel out.

566
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,379
I was gonna peel out and...
Don't take the steam out.

567
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,331
Tell people we pushed you!

568
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:40,641
All right, class, feel free to text or
watch movies, whatever it is you do.

569
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:42,910
Not today, Doc.

570
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,545
What are you doing, Dee?

571
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:48,348
I am inspiring you.

572
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,783
Rise and shine, dickwad.

573
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:54,254
Okay, this is a great teacher,
but he is wasted on you.

574
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,656
Well, not anymore.

575
00:17:55,723 --> 00:18:00,494
We're gonna be rehearsing a little
musical today called Frankenstein.

576
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,695
This is stupid.

577
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,630
Get out.
You're stupid, What?

578
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:04,264
You heard me.

579
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:05,999
You get out of here, you stupid idiot.

580
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:06,833
It's fine with me.

581
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:07,801
Yeah, good.

582
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:11,338
And anybody else who doesn't want to be
here today, you can get out now, too.

583
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,040
Hey, you want to go to the mall?

584
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:14,474
No, no, wait. No, no, stop.

585
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,143
Now come on, you guys!

586
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,244
That's... Not everybody.

587
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,045
Sit back down.

588
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:19,212
That's just something people say.

589
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,881
You guys are gonna love this.

590
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,617
Okay, let's get started.

591
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,691
Have you seen Dr. Frankenstein's creation
that they all speak of?

592
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:35,295
Nay, I've heard tales
told of his hideousness.

593
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,164
A monster most foul.

594
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:50,043
♪ My face composed of
rotten flesh, roar, roar!

595
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:56,550
♪ A hideous beast with deadly
clutch, roar, roar!

596
00:18:56,618 --> 00:19:09,963
♪ Another's heart beats in my chest
I'll never know a woman's touch... Roar! ♪

597
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,397
And then I retreat into the mist
and Dr. Myers, you are Dr. Frankenstein

598
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:14,989
so get up here and get acting!

599
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,436
With pleasure, Dee!

600
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:20,841
Just let me set the
loop, and here I come!

601
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:27,814
Oh, whoops. That's not...
I am shattered to pieces!

602
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:29,916
Are you acting right now?

603
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:32,886
No, I'm not acting, you bitch!

604
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,455
I think I've broke my hip.

605
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:40,327
Why is this damn stage so slippery?

606
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,167
Charlie boy!

607
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,002
This floor is slippery, man.

608
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,738
Old school slippery 'cause I
waxed it real good with this

609
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,607
awesome power waxer that
the school provided me.

610
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,259
I did this whole place
in, like, two hours.

611
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,680
Oh, nice. Whoa, that's impressive.
Yeah.

612
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,046
Dee inspired me.

613
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,614
She said, "You're an
awesome janitor, Charlie.

614
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,008
"You can make this whole
school slippery."

615
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:03,898
I said, "Sure, I'll
give it my best shot."

616
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,384
Then she's, like, "Let's
be best friends."

617
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,191
And I was, like, "Sure, I'll
give that my best shot, too."

618
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:08,575
So we're best friends now.

619
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:12,099
Yeah, yeah, that's quite a conversation
you had with her, isn't it?

620
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,722
Mm-hmm.
What do you guys want?

621
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:17,868
Oh, well, we, uh, we came to ya
because we wanted to tell you

622
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:21,520
that we're sorry for picking
Schmidty over you, and we feel

623
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,864
like we made a big mistake,
and we want you back, buddy.

624
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:28,622
And, uh, we pushed
him out of a moving car for you.

625
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:30,528
I can't do it.

626
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,138
What is wrong with you?
All right, I'll handle it.

627
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:35,749
Charlie, we have an announcement
to make: it's your lucky day.

628
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,005
We want you back.

629
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,293
Yeah.

630
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,423
Gotta say this is pretty
classy, guys, but I wish you

631
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:47,292
gave me one of these a long time
time ago 'cause I'm a janitor now.
