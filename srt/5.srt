1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,164
<i>- You're such a dildo, dude.
- Thanks, dude.</i>

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,105
<i>Thanks.
That's a good way to start the day.</i>

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,369
Is that soy veggie health drink
supposed to erase the damage...

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,377
you did to your liver last night?

5
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,278
Is that coffee gonna help you forget
that elephant you slept with last night?

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,839
Oh, come on.
You don't have to be so judgmental.

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,385
- She was gross, dude.
- She wasn't that gross, all right?

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,889
If you lowered your standards a bit,
you'd get laid more. Give me a sip of this.

9
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,584
- No!
- I just wanna try it.

10
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,855
You do not get to taste my delicious
healthy drink after making fun of it.

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,364
- Why not? Just give it to me.
- 'Cause I don't know what kind of diseases that girl had.

12
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,366
She doesn't have any diseases!

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,631
<i>- Dude, she was really gross.
- Guys!</i>

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,162
- We got a real serious problem.
- There's been a B&E, dude.

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,539
- A what?
- A B&E, dude!

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,135
- A B&E?
- What does that mean?

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,806
Somebody broke into the bar
and stole our safe.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,612
- Breaking and entering. B&E.
- No. No!

19
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,811
- Are you serious?
- Oh, my God!

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,321
- When did this happen?
- Last night, I guess.

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,152
<i>Wejust walked in this morning
and found it like that.</i>

22
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,749
- Who locked up last night?
- I did. But that's the thing. The locks weren't even broken.

23
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,955
- So somebody just waltzed in here and stole the safe?
- But it's not my fault.

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,625
<i>- Well, it's somebody's fault.
- I know it's somebody's fault!</i>

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,464
<i>- Well, it's somebody's fault!
- I know that!</i>

26
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,370
Guys! Guys! We're not gonna
get anywhere yelling at each other!

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,273
- We need to be rational.
- All right, all right.

28
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,539
- Okay! I think it's clear what needs to happen.
- What?

29
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,943
We need to buy a gun.

30
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,509
So what do you think?

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,241
I think next time you boys
ought to get the kind of safe...

32
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,546
that a relatively small man
can't just carry away.

33
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,246
But there's been, like, a string
of these robberies all over the area.

34
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,085
- You don't have any leads or...
- Not really.

35
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,785
"Not really."
What in the hell does that even mean?

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,886
How could there not be any leads?
The guy must have left something behind.

37
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,363
- People are working on it.
- Hey, you guys.

38
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,458
They're pretty sure it's the same guy
who's been hittin' all the bars around here.

39
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,003
- We know, Charlie.
- So we're done here, Harris.

40
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,199
- What... So that's it?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,572
We'll call you
if we come up with anything.

42
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,271
<i>- Well, thanks.
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

43
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,143
You know what?
Let's go get that gun.

44
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,182
- Whoa. Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,650
Guns are not a good idea. They're dangerous.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

46
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,120
- Yeah. Mac, no guns.
- Guys, somebody stole our safe, right?

47
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,714
Am I crazy? We need to
be able to protect ourselves...

48
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,725
in case something
like this happens again.

49
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,227
- Clearly, Philly's finest don't give a shit.
- Mac is absolutely right.

50
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,595
- What if one of us was here when it happened?
- We would have been killed.

51
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,762
- No, you don't know that. Come on.
- Hey, babe.

52
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,931
- Hey, Colin.
- Mmm.

53
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,532
- Was that law enforcement?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,043
- Is everything all right?
- No, dude. We got robbed last night.

55
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,012
Oh, shit!

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,880
Are you kiddin' me?
Oh... What happened?

57
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,853
Remember the other day when you were
making fun of us for having such a tiny safe?

58
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:14,087
That really sucks, guys. Look, we have
reservations at Guajino's at 12:00, and...

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,994
- Yep. Just about...
- Guys, it's a travesty. I'm sorry.

60
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,492
No guns.

61
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,870
Dude, your sister has
the worst taste in men.

62
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,375
No shit. I hate that guy.
He's like a full-on '80s movie stereotype.

63
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,343
Plus, he's a total player.

64
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,346
What do you mean?

65
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,382
You don't know about this?
Oh, my God!

66
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,417
That guy's dated, like,
every hot bartender in town.

67
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,385
I saw him a week ago
with Wendy from Dirty Frank's.

68
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,388
Hand all down
the back of her pants.

69
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,356
<i>- Oh! Gross.
- Very gross.</i>

70
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,290
Whatever, dude.
Charlie, close up shop.

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,920
Dennis, let's go get us a gun.

72
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,924
Do you really think
they're gonna buy one?

73
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,969
No. I mean,
I told them not to...

74
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,698
but Mac gets a boner
every single time he thinks about a gun.

75
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,037
- Well, I think it's a great idea.
- I'm... I'm sorry?

76
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,873
I think it's really smart.

77
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,913
Owning and knowing
how to properly use a firearm...

78
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,449
is an important part
of what makes this country great.

79
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,609
Well, that's what
I was trying to tell them...

80
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,653
- To tell you the truth...
- What?

81
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,248
There's nothing sexier
than when you're firing a gun.

82
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:22,055
Actually,
it really turns me on.

83
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,222
Well, that's exactly why I want you
to teach me how to use one, sexy.

84
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,096
- It would be my pleasure.
- I think the pleasure would be all mine.

85
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,897
You've got a poppy seed
in your teeth.

86
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,973
Hmm.

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,601
- Get it?
- It's a big one. You might wanna go to the bathroom.

88
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,577
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Calm down! All right!</i>

89
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,621
Hwang.
You're just in time, buddy.

90
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,054
- Charlie, my rent.
- Okay, listen.

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,786
- Listen to me for a second while I...
- No! I cannot wait anymore!

92
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,260
Don't come over here and just start yelling at me!

93
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,297
Hwang! Hey! Wait!

94
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:03,461
Let me go get something,
and I'll fix it.

95
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,630
All right, hurry up.
Hurry up!

96
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,834
I can't wait too long!
Hwang not patient!

97
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,968
You getting my money?

98
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,673
Would you like
a Rice Krispie treat?

99
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,974
- $854 you owe me!
- I realize how much money it is!

100
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,077
I'm not gonna take it no more!

101
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,181
I placed a couple bad investments!

102
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,818
Hwang!

103
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:32,490
I placed a couple of bad investments.
It could happen to anyone, right?

104
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,692
Okay.

105
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,258
I'm going to get your...

106
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,330
goddamn money
by the end of the month, okay?

107
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,870
- I come back tomorrow. I want my goddamn money!
- Yeah, tomorrow.

108
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,608
- I want my money!
- Okay.

109
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,787
Dickhead!

110
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,758
Okay, Dennis. We're gonna be
very careful about this, right?

111
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,192
We'll stash it right here
just in case we need it.

112
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,525
Until then, we don't go near it.

113
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,794
- Hopefully, we never have to pick it up again.
- Hopefully.

114
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,835
- You wanna shoot it?
- Yes.

115
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,763
- Yeah!
- Yes!

116
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,605
- How do you like me now, log?
- You totally killed that log, dude.

117
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,544
I totally killed it. I always knew
that I'd be good at this stuff.

118
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,547
- You're a really good shot, Dennis.
- Thanks, bro.

119
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,549
You're pretty good too, Hoss.

120
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,051
- You hit the log, like, a bunch of times, man.
- I did.

121
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,452
If that log was trying to rob the place,
you would have killed it.

122
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,456
- I would have killed it!
- You totally would have killed it.

123
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,458
- Absolutely!
- Hey, you wanna shoot it some more?

124
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,460
- Yeah!
- Hey, can I load it up though?

125
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,258
- Absolutely! You like the sound.
- I like the sound of the clip.

126
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,923
- Hey!
- Hey!

127
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,900
- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Oh, Charlie, check it out.

128
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,561
- Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
- Check it out.

129
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,662
- That's not fun! That's not a toy.
- Oh, come on, Charlie.

130
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,572
I'm serious, man. You shouldn't
be playing around with guns.

131
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,338
First of all, we need to open the bar.
We got robbed.

132
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,380
Hwang is all over my ass
because of rent.

133
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,116
- You wanna hold it?
- No. No.

134
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,710
- Come on. Just hold it.
- I wanna open the bar!

135
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,154
- Hold it for a little bit.
- No, I don't wanna hold it.

136
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,748
Fine. Give me the gun.
Fine. Yes. I'll hold the gun. Okay.

137
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,193
Good. Nice.
Really nice feel to it.

138
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,528
That's really good.
Is this thing loaded?

139
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,533
It can be.

140
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,773
- That's my boy!
- Whoo! That's amazing!

141
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,471
- Yeah. Can you feel it?
- You bet I can feel it! Come on!

142
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,606
- Describe what you feel.
- I feel like, uh...

143
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:34,745
I feel focused and I feel badass
and just, um...

144
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,755
badass, you know?

145
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,656
- I think he's got it, Mac.
- Yes, he does.

146
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:44,128
- Got what?
- Charlie, my boy, you've got the gun fever.

147
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,526
Whoo!

148
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,570
That's what I'm talking about.
You seeing this?

149
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,571
- Yeah.
- That is sexy.

150
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,573
- Yep, totally.
- You feeling sexy?

151
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,474
- I don't know.
- Hey, hey, hey. It's all right to be a little nervous.

152
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,479
Everyone's nervous their first time.
But I promise you...

153
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,210
once you put
your hand around this...

154
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,117
you are gonna love it.

155
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,417
Well, actually,
I've got something I think you'll love.

156
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,720
I'd rather watch you
shoot the gun here.

157
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,495
- What if I...
- Just shoot the gun, Dee.

158
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,497
Okay.

159
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,762
Why would I not be serious?

160
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,498
- All right. Thanks, Detective.
- Nothing?

161
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,700
No, nothing. I don't think they're taking
this seriously on any level, dude.

162
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,437
Of course they're not, dude.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

163
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,639
These cops don't
give a shit about us.

164
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,342
I think it's time we took matters
into our own hands.

165
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,884
- How?
- Maybe we should do a little investigating of our own.

166
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:44,048
Do some snoopin' around,
try to crack the case. We got the gun.

167
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,581
That's true.
Wanna go shoot it some more?

168
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,150
- Yes!
- Let's do that.

169
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,755
- Pow, pow, pow!
- Whoa! What the hell?

170
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,596
- What?
- Dude, the gun's not here.

171
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,193
- Holy shit! What are you talkin' about?
- Look! Look!

172
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,364
It's...

173
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,703
- Charlie?
- Charlie.

174
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,107
- Yeah, I got the gun.
- Why, Charlie?

175
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,479
It's supposed to be here
to protect the bar.

176
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,610
Yeah, I know. I know.
I just, uh...

177
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,713
- You just what?
- I just needed it.

178
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,385
<i>- Is this the gun fever talking, dude?
- No...</i>

179
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,394
It's not...
I don't have the gun fever, man.

180
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,488
Look, I'm coming in to work later.
I'll bring it with me.

181
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,626
<i>I really don't like the sound of this, Charlie.</i>

182
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,194
Hey, hey, hey. I gotta go, dude.
I'll see you guys at the bar.

183
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,264
He hung up.

184
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,334
<i>All right! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

185
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,109
I'm coming! All right.
Hang on a second there.

186
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,583
- Hey, Hwang.
- Okay, so you got my money now?

187
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,751
I got some Rice Krispie treats in
the fridge. You want some more of those?

188
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,288
Charlie, I don't like you.
I never liked you.

189
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,392
So just give me my money,
or Hwang will be forced to...

190
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,798
I'm sorry. Forced to...

191
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,647
- What you doing?
- Hmm?

192
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,082
- What's that?
- So, listen, Hwang.

193
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,381
Let me talk to you
about your money for a second.

194
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,615
Uh, I don't have it
right now, you know?

195
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,455
I just don't have it.
But I'm gonna get it...

196
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,551
because I have my ways.

197
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,030
Do you know what I mean, Hwang,
when I say I have my ways?

198
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,035
What is that? Is that a yes?

199
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,999
Sometimes I can't understand you.
You're talking, but I don't understand you.

200
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,271
So say yes if you know what I mean
when I say I have my ways.

201
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,972
- Yes.
- Oh, good boy. Get lost.

202
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:06,891
<i>All right. So we got the binoculars.
We got the ziplock baggies.</i>

203
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:10,492
We got the Maglite. I think as soon as
Charlie gets here with the gun, we're all set.

204
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,469
This is great, dude.
This is great. We're like the Hardy Boys.

205
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,664
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

206
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:16,673
So I'll be Frank.
You beJoe.

207
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,141
'Cause Frank was kind of the leader,
and that makes a little more sense...

208
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,669
- Didn't Frank have blond hair?
- Yeah. But that doesn't make any difference...

209
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,738
- So I should be Frank 'cause I have lighter...
- The hair color doesn't matter.

210
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,784
It's all about who's
making the plans and...

211
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,786
If we're gonna play
Frank and Joe Hardy...

212
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,482
- But I'm the leader clearly in this partnership!
- Why are we talking about this?

213
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:33,490
You're right.
We have a lot of work to do.

214
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:36,220
- What's the first step?
- So I'm the leader. Great. Let's roll.

215
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:39,889
Wait, no. We can't go. What are you doing?
We gotta open up the bar.

216
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,990
Or we could call your sister
to do her job...

217
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,559
that is if she's not having sex with Colin
and every other bartender in Philadelphia.

218
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:48,231
- Don't do that. It's gross.
- Look, dude, we need to jump on this.

219
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,503
- Let's go do some investigating.
- All right. All...

220
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,044
Wait a second.

221
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,843
<i>- What?
- Holy shit!</i>

222
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,612
- I know who stole our safe.
- You do?

223
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,846
Yeah.
Let's go get that gun.

224
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,549
<i>- Yeah, let's get the gun. Wait, wait. Bag, bag, bag.
- Oh, the bag.</i>

225
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,888
<i>- All right. I'm driving.
- Okay. No, I'm driving.</i>

226
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,595
I hope Charlie
didn't do anything stupid.

227
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,864
Whatever Charlie's doing right now,
it's probably pretty stupid.

228
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,871
Let's just hope nobody got hurt.

229
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,600
- Yeah.
- Yo.

230
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,107
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.

231
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,407
- Can we get that gun?
- Oh. Why?

232
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,778
Well, first of all,
we shouldn't have to tell you why.

233
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,783
We bought it.
It's ours.

234
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:36,048
But if you must know, it's because
we know who knocked over the bar.

235
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,884
Really?

236
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,516
Yeah.
Can we get the gun?

237
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,117
- Why?
- Because we know who... Okay, you know what, dude?

238
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:47,029
Move. Oh, this place
is a shit-hole, Charlie. It smells.

239
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,692
So, don't you wanna know
who did it?

240
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,760
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Who was it?
- Colin.

241
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:55,362
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. Think about it.

242
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,409
It all makes sense.
Colin goes around town...

243
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,808
with every hot
bartender chick, right?

244
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,177
He woos them with his charm
and his good looks.

245
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:06,115
He finds out where the safes are.
He finds out how to get in.

246
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:09,585
You remember when Sweet Dee said that
he was laughing about how small the safe was?

247
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:12,885
You saw how quickly he changed
the subject when she brought that safe up.

248
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,858
Right. All right.
So what's the plan?

249
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:19,090
I'll slide the gun meaningfully
into the front of my pants...

250
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,724
- I know that game.
- Yeah.

251
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,030
- So why don't you go get it?
- Go get the gun!

252
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,569
All right. Here.

253
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:29,437
- Oh!
- Do you want it?

254
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:33,375
Hey, Dee.
Are you with Colin right now?

255
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,005
Oh, no. He had to meet
someone at Fingers Bar, huh?

256
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,107
- Nice.
- Okay.

257
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,880
Why don't you take the night off, okay?
You deserve it.

258
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,887
- All right. You're welcome. Bye.
- Pow, pow, pow.

259
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:48,415
- You ready?
- Ready, Freddy. Oh.

260
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,586
It goes...
Uh, stick it back in...

261
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:01,496
<i>- What a penis!
- Like you wouldn't do such a thing?</i>

262
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,736
- Come on. Let's nail this prick.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

263
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:07,039
Didn't Fingers already get robbed?

264
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:10,013
- Uh, yeah.
- So what's this guy doing, going in for round two?

265
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:13,312
- I don't know. Can we do this thing?
- Wait. Hold on.

266
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:18,652
Do you think this guy would be
dumb enough to rob the same bar twice?

267
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,123
- Yeah, I do.
- Me too.

268
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,286
All right, change of plans.
Leave the gun.

269
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:27,126
I'm gonna get this asshole
to hit Paddy's again.

270
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,065
Follow my lead.
I'm the leader.

271
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,205
- Hey, Colin!
- Colin!

272
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:42,508
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, fellas.

273
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,548
Didn't expect to see you here.

274
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:48,279
- Yeah. I was just... Actually, I was leaving.
- Leaving?

275
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,116
- Having a little drink, huh? Little drinky-poo.
- Couple drinks?

276
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:53,885
- Yeah. Just, uh... Yeah, just a little drink.
- Yeah?

277
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,724
What's up, man? You seem like, uh,
the cat who ate the canary.

278
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,696
No...

279
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,528
Canary... No, I was just...
I didn't expect to see you guys here.

280
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,763
- Why?
- Well, I thought you'd be at Paddy's.

281
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,635
Paddy's, no.
We actually closed up shop for the night.

282
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,505
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thought we'd get wasted here instead, you know?

283
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,067
- Just a little freaked out about the robbery.
- Yeah.

284
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:18,343
But, actually, funny story. Turns out the
dickhead didn't actually get all of our money.

285
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:22,216
- We actually keep it in the register instead of the safe.
- Yeah.

286
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,721
So the stupid asshole didn't even think
to look there, right?

287
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:28,782
- What a cock!
- What an idiot! What an idiot! What a total idiot, right?

288
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,351
- Boner, really.
- Schmuck.

289
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,363
- Stupid idiot.
- Yeah, so, you know.

290
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:36,059
As soon as we get some new locks,
we should be all set.

291
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:39,331
- Yeah.
- So we're just probably gonna hop in here...

292
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:40,928
- Grab a couple drinks here tonight.
- Yeah, get wasted.

293
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:44,532
- Maybe pass out.
- Or walk home with a couple of hot waitresses.

294
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,770
Right, Colin?

295
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,746
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.

296
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:53,079
- All right, well, don't wanna keep you.
- Yeah.

297
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,348
- We'll see you later. You look spiffy, bro.
- Yeah, you look good.

298
00:15:56,421 --> 00:16:00,380
- Maybe you guys should get a gun.
- What?

299
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,256
Well, Dee was saying that
you were thinking about getting a gun.

300
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,228
I think it's a good idea.

301
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:11,825
Good protection. I, uh...
I keep one on me all the time.

302
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,870
I don't know.
Think about it.

303
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,669
<i>- Absolutely.
- Enjoy your drinky.</i>

304
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,710
- Yeah.
- We will. All right, man.

305
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,076
<i>- Have a good night, bro. Yeah.
- See you later.</i>

306
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,583
- He's got a gun on him at all times.
- From now on, so will we.

307
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,845
Dude, you just laid it on
way too thick back there.

308
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,911
There's no way he's gonna hit Paddy's
again tonight. He'd have to be a moron.

309
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,184
He is a moron, dude.
He'll be there.

310
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,556
Hey, Dee.
Yeah, listen.

311
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,858
There's a change of plans. I need you
to meet us at Paddy's tonight after all.

312
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,864
Something you need to see.

313
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,661
- Why did you guys bring me into this?
- You'll see.

314
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,171
- Did you turn off the circuit breaker?
- Yeah, dude. We're all set.

315
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,207
Check.

316
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,971
- What the hell was that?
- Did you just cock back the hammer, bro?

317
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,980
- No.
- Wait a second. You guys have a gun?

318
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:59,778
Hey, listen to me.
We are not shooting anybody tonight.

319
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:03,082
- I know.
- Dennis, you are not shooting anyone!

320
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,088
I don't want to shoot
anyone, Sweet Dee!

321
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,090
- You better not shoot anybody.
- I don't have...

322
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,149
- I should be holding the gun.
- I have better...

323
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:12,162
- Well, I put this whole thing together.
- I shot the log way more times!

324
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,028
- This is so bad.
- But I'm the one who has better aim than you!

325
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,033
<i>What? What? Is he here?</i>

326
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,929
- Oh, there he is.
- Okay.

327
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,804
- What's he doing?
- He's walking toward the cash register.

328
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,844
Oh, he looks shady.

329
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:29,641
<i>Yeah. That's him.</i>

330
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,739
<i>That's it. Do the flashlight.</i>

331
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,341
<i>- Turn the flashlight on!
- I can't reach it!</i>

332
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,250
No, no!
He's getting away!

333
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,720
<i>- Shoot him!
- What?</i>

334
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:40,257
- Shoot him!
- Shoot him in his face!

335
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,522
Shit!

336
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,825
<i>- Did you get him?
- I'm shot!</i>

337
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:49,355
<i>- Charlie? Oh, my God!
- Oh, my god!</i>

338
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:52,164
Turn on the circuit breaker!
Turn on the circuit breaker!

339
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,899
- Did you shoot me, Dennis?
- L... Uh, no. L...

340
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,565
- Why did you shoot me?
- Oh, my God!

341
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,575
- My God! Dude, are you okay?
- Where are you shot?

342
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:01,737
- In my head!
- What?

343
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:05,340
Oh, my God! Charlie, I shot you
in your head. I am so sorry.

344
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,350
- Is he okay?
- No, I'm not okay! He shot me in my head!

345
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,979
<i>- No. It must havejust grazed his head.
- You shot him in the head, bro!</i>

346
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,023
<i>- If I shot him in the head, he'd be dead.
- It really hurts!</i>

347
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:16,527
- I gotta go to a hospital!
- All right, man. I'll call an ambulance.

348
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,222
The hospital's, like, three blocks away.
We should just drive him!

349
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:22,095
I know that. But I don't wanna get blood
stains all over the interior of my car.

350
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,396
<i>Are you serious?</i>

351
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:27,097
All right!
I'll take you to a hospital! God!

352
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:29,401
All right, get a trash bag.
We'll put it over him.

353
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,749
- I can't believe you shot Charlie, dude.
- Don't start this again!

354
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,342
- You almost killed our best friend.
- You told me to shoot Charlie!

355
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,217
<i>You guys told me
to shoot Charlie.</i>

356
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,087
The minute the shit hits the fan, you guys
are, like, "Dennis, don't shoot the gun!"

357
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,752
- I was not!
- Then all of a sudden, you told me to shoot him in the face!

358
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,818
I didn't say that!

359
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,882
- Hey.
- Hey, there he is. How you feeling, buddy?

360
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,944
You shot me, dude.

361
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,785
But, Charlie, you were stealing
from the bar. It was an honest mistake.

362
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,052
I still kind of wish
you didn't shoot me.

363
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,924
- If you needed help with money, why didn't you talk to us?
- Yeah, man.

364
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,362
L... I had it all
worked out, all right?

365
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,266
I was gonna make it look like all
the other robberies going on around town.

366
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:36,467
Then we would collect
some insurance money and...

367
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:41,170
- Wow, dude. That's really just goddamn ridiculous.
- That is so dumb.

368
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,736
- I thought it was the best idea I ever had.
- No, it's not at all.

369
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,976
<i>- But you know what?
- It might be the best idea you've ever had, but...</i>

370
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,712
Listen. Listen. The important thing
is that you are all right.

371
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:52,244
And we talked about it, and we decided
we need to get rid of that gun.

372
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:54,553
Oh, oh, the gun.
Yeah, we're getting rid of the gun.

373
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,924
- It's too dangerous.
- You could have been killed. Dennis could have killed you.

374
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,725
<i>Okay, good. Yes.
I think that would be for the best.</i>

375
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:03,130
Ah. Mmm.
Dee, could you get me a nurse?

376
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,431
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure.

377
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,505
Tell me we're not
getting rid of that gun.

378
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,600
No way!

379
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,702
- Never.
- Sweet.

380
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,275
<i>No, he's fine. It turns out
itjust kind of grazed his head.</i>

381
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,444
Oh, that's great news, babe.

382
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,978
Thank you so much for calling though.
You are so sweet, Colin.

383
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,252
I guess I'm just a sweet guy.

384
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,260
All right.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow?

385
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:32,694
- You will.
- Okay. Good night.

386
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,732
Dream of me.

387
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,560
Idiots.
