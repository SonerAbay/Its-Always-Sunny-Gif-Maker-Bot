1
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,708
Good morning, South
Philadelphia Animal Shelter.

2
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:11,395
Yes, hello, I would like
to apply for an adoption, please.

3
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:13,335
Hey, what are
you guys talking about?

4
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,306
We're adopting a
dog-fighting pit bull.

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,374
We're gonna keep it in
the bar, all right?

6
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:18,631
Well, why wasn't I
consulted about this?

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,251
Because last time we tried to
get a junkyard dog, we wound up

8
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,763
getting a junkyard cat, and that's
exactly where you're gonna go with it.

9
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:24,819
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:26,655
Because I don't want some
goddamn snarling hellhound

11
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:28,525
running around inside of our bar!

12
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:29,693
Are you crazy?

13
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,562
Look, we're going to
rehabilitate the dog, okay?

14
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,397
We don't want it to
attack other dogs.

15
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,199
Now we would like for
it to attack people.

16
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,002
If it attacks a person, great!

17
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,037
Yeah. And, if the dog-- or when
the dog-- bites a customer,

18
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,640
that person then can go home and have
a great story for their friends.

19
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:42,541
It's a win-win for everybody.

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,442
That's true!

21
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,443
You can go, like, "Dude, I got
bit a pit bull in a bar."

22
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,444
In Paddy's! It was awesome!

23
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,146
Awesome! And if you're an intruder,
you should get bit by a pit bull.

24
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,048
I don't understand.

25
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,716
See, the biggest... Uh, how long do
you think this process usually takes?

26
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:53,517
Just a dial tone now.

27
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,386
She just hung up on
me, for some reason.

28
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:00,955
Wait for me
in the back back.

29
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,957
Okay, babe.

30
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:07,945
Hey, who's that?

31
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:10,462
It's my new girlfriend-- Roxy.

32
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,549
That woman seems
like a prostitute.

33
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,321
That's because she is.

34
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,348
You're dating a prostitute?

35
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,134
Not for long.

36
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,639
I'm gonna make that whore my wife.

37
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:33,812

38
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,615
What the hell...?

39
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:51,483
I don't know.

40
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,284
Are they...?

41
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,286
Oh, no!

42
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,188
You did not just do that.

43
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:57,290
Oh-ho-ho.

44
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,891
That-that broad is a live wire.

45
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:04,930
I'm goin' outside, 'cause
this place is shit hole!

46
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,701
What are you cocks lookin' at?

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,732
Frank...
that woman is unspeakably crass.

48
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,034
You're gonna marry that, Frank?

49
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,514
She's been my number-one
girl for a long while now.

50
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,834
But she's still
plowing other dudes.

51
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,537
In fact, Tiger Woods has
been calling her lately.

52
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:23,571
No. No, no, no.

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,506
That can't be the truth.

54
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:25,373
That's bullshit.

55
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,290
There is no way that Tiger Woods
is interested in that woman.

56
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,235
Look, can't you find someone
who loves you for who you are?

57
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:32,715
That woman's only in
it for the money!

58
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:33,953
Mm-mm! Let me stop you real quick.

59
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,490
Someone love Frank for who he is?

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,529
Come on!

61
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,197
No! He's got a ton
of good qualities.

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,166
Yes, he does!

63
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:40,967
I mean, like what?

64
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:41,935
Like what?

65
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,104
Dude, the other day, we were
hanging out under the bridge; we

66
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,106
found box of denim, and I'm,
like, "You know, these look like

67
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,743
good jeans in here," and he's, like,
"You want to split it with me, 50-50?"

68
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,645
I mean, that's a nice thing to do.

69
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:52,480
I wanted you to have
half of that denim.

70
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,281
He shared half the jeans.

71
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,316
Charlie! Charlie!

72
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,185
Stop wearing clothes you find
washing up under bridges.

73
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,119
Oh, they're boiled, yeah.

74
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:57,953
Yeah!

75
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:58,755
Yeah, we boil all our denim.

76
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,591
- Oh, good, well, they're boiled, so...
- Hey!

77
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,926
Hey, you know, there is some
dirty crack whore in the alley,

78
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,129
blowing the busboy from the
restaurant down the street.

79
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:07,964
This is exactly why
we need that dog.

80
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,765
Let's get that dog!

81
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,968
Mac, you look bad.

82
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,202
Really, really bad.

83
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,904
What?

84
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:16,973
Yeah, is that your
shirt or my shirt?

85
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,208
That's, like, way
too small for you.

86
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:20,276
You look fat as shit!

87
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,212
Okay, okay, I'm getting very
concerned with the integrity of

88
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,380
our organization here.

89
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,582
Mac, you have gained, I
mean, 50 pounds of fat.

90
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:26,483
Mass.

91
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:27,417
Fat.

92
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:28,285
Muscle.

93
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,486
Let's be clear: fat.

94
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,354
It's fat.

95
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:33,023
Frank, you are talking about marrying
hookers-- this is ridiculous!

96
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:33,957
What's going on with our group?

97
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:34,758
We're becoming the Gross Crew.

98
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:35,692
The Gross Crew?!

99
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,593
The Gross Crew.

100
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:37,361
And I don't like that.

101
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:38,395
I don't want that, all right?

102
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:39,363
I don't want that.

103
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:40,209
So, if we're gonna have this
woman hanging around, then we

104
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,310
gotta clean her up or something.

105
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,635
I tell you what-- what if we took a
<i>Pretty Woman</i> and threw it

106
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:44,609
Roxy's way.

107
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,896
Hey... <i>Pretty Woman?</i>

108
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,400
<i>That was a bullshit movie.</i>

109
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,706
<i>People don't change like that.</i>

110
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:50,640
<i>People change, Frank.</i>

111
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:51,775
<i>Look at me.</i>

112
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:54,611
<i>I went from a tiny twink to the
muscle-bound freak you see before you.</i>

113
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,412
<i>You're not helping my argument.</i>

114
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,281
<i>Okay, yeah, and if you're gonna
chime in, please don't do</i>

115
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,149
<i>it with a mouthful of burrito.</i>

116
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,016
<i>This is a chimichanga.</i>

117
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,018
<i>You are becoming a chimichanga!</i>

118
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,753
<i>All right, all of you-- I'm
gonna give you all 24 hours to</i>

119
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,355
<i>do whatever you have to do, but,</i>

120
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:11,393
<i>tomorrow night, I am proposing
to that dirty whore.</i>

121
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:25,405
<i>This is gonna be a little bit
harder than we thought.</i>

122
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,174
<i>This woman is a real
piece of shit.</i>

123
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,008
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

124
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,843
<i>Where's Frank?</i>

125
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:31,712
<i>Don't worry about Frank, Roxy.</i>

126
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,780
<i>We're here to help you
turn your life around.</i>

127
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,982
<i>See, a lot of times, the second
act of someone's life can be</i>

128
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:36,816
<i>much better than the first.</i>

129
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:37,850
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

130
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,885
<i>Well, yeah, we just want to make</i>

131
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:40,019
<i>some changes in your life, Roxy.</i>

132
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,888
<i>Perhaps get you some new clothes.</i>

133
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:42,722
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

134
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,424
<i>Uh, hopefully, teach
you some manners.</i>

135
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,593
<i>Shut up, baby dick.</i>

136
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,462
<i>All right, well, I'm out of here.</i>

137
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:49,163
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

138
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,998
<i>No, I... Don't go, don't go.</i>

139
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:51,966
<i>We haven't even started yet.</i>

140
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:53,000
<i>Come on... Frank was right.</i>

141
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,068
<i>This woman cannot change.</i>

142
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:54,970
<i>People don't just change.</i>

143
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:56,004
<i>People change!</i>

144
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:56,838
<i>She can change.</i>

145
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:57,839
<i>I'm gonna change.</i>

146
00:04:57,908 --> 00:04:58,874
<i>What? You're gonna change?!</i>

147
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:00,676
<i>What the hell are
you talking about?</i>

148
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,745
<i>Well, I'm gearing up to get
into my second act, you know?</i>

149
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:03,679
<i>And that's very exciting for me.</i>

150
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,748
<i>And I'd like to help Roxy do
the same thing, that's all.</i>

151
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:06,515
<i>No... no, no, Dee.</i>

152
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,450
<i>Aw, really?</i>

153
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,384
<i>What?</i>

154
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:09,818
<i>No, you're already
in your second act.</i>

155
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:10,820
<i>Me?</i>

156
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:13,088
<i>Yeah. We're all in our second
acts-- don't you see that?</i>

157
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,790
<i>And I, for one, I don't
want things to change.</i>

158
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:16,391
<i>I want them to stay the way they
were, because my first act</i>

159
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,192
<i>was awesome.</i>

160
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,927
<i>See, your first act was-was
shit, and that's why you're so</i>

161
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,896
<i>desperate for things
to be different.</i>

162
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:22,530
<i>But they rarely ever
do get different.</i>

163
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,098
<i>If anything-- God, they get worse.</i>

164
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,400
<i>I mean, look at Mac.</i>

165
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:26,334
<i>I got salsa on my shirt.</i>

166
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:27,368
<i>He got salsa on his shirt.</i>

167
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:29,937
<i>Okay... here's howhings need
to go from here on out.</i>

168
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,006
<i>You gotta deal with this woman,
because I can't handle it...</i>

169
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,073
<i>all right?</i>

170
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:35,242
<i>She made things personal, and
I won't stand for that.</i>

171
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,344
<i>Somebody needs to take care of
Mac, and that's gonna be me,</i>

172
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,379
<i>because his fatness is starting
to affect our entire crew.</i>

173
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,313
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

174
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,448
<i>So I'm gonna take him with me,
because the man is carrying</i>

175
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:44,384
<i>around trash bags filled
with Mexican foods.</i>

176
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:45,652
<i>What's that smell?</i>

177
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,253
<i>Crack.</i>

178
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:48,955
<i>That is crack rock.</i>

179
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:49,990
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

180
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,024
<i>She's smoking crack!</i>

181
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:51,958
<i>Oh, she's smoking crack.</i>

182
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:52,792
<i>Okay, she's smoking crack.</i>

183
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,427
<i>Uh, this is no longer a
safe environment for me.</i>

184
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:55,094
<i>Mac, let's go.</i>

185
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,429
<i>Come on, I gotta get out of here.</i>

186
00:05:56,498 --> 00:05:58,431
<i>Whew!</i>

187
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,003
<i>I got a really good
thing going with Roxy.</i>

188
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,405
<i>She's a sweet bitch.</i>

189
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:05,573
<i>Yeah, but she's mean.</i>

190
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:07,809
<i>She's definitely only
into you for the money.</i>

191
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,111
<i>Well, so, Barbara was only
into me for the money.</i>

192
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>Yeah, but you deserve
better than that, man.</i>

193
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,448
<i>Look, I'm already on it, okay?</i>

194
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:15,317
<i>I signed you up on a
dating Web site.</i>

195
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,385
<i>I got you a date, dude!</i>

196
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:17,420
<i>Yeah?</i>

197
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,454
<i>Check it out, though.</i>

198
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,489
<i>I got a little twist on this date.</i>

199
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:22,391
<i>This girl does think she's
meeting a millionaire.</i>

200
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,326
<i>Why'd you say that, Charlie?</i>

201
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,426
<i>That... defeats the purpose.</i>

202
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:27,096
<i>Well, I'm gonna be
the millionaire.</i>

203
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,063
<i>Oh. Explain.</i>

204
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,365
<i>All right, check it out.</i>

205
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,433
<i>You're gonna play my
limo driver, right?</i>

206
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:33,469
<i>You're just like a regular
working stiff to this girl.</i>

207
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,604
<i>She doesn't think you're
a millionaire, okay?</i>

208
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,639
<i>Then we're out on the date and
I'm, like, "Oh, I don't feel</i>

209
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,740
<i>very well.</i>

210
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:39,941
<i>I gotta go home.</i>

211
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,957
<i>But let's not waste this date.</i>

212
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:45,179
<i>Why don't you finish the
date with my limo driver!"</i>

213
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,198
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

214
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:47,199
<i>Smart, Charlie.</i>

215
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:48,300
<i>I mean, yeah, she's not gonna</i>

216
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,032
<i>be able to resist an
opportunity like that.</i>

217
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,117
<i>A night with a limo driver?</i>

218
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,269
<i>This is a good idea.</i>

219
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,541
- <i>Right?</i>
- <i>I'm gonna give it a whirl.</i>

220
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,240
- <i>All right, man!</i>
- <i>All right, Charlie!</i>

221
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:57,008
<i>Oh, here, I think
these are are done.</i>

222
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,409
- <i>That first one's done?</i>
- <i>Yeah, this batch is done.</i>

223
00:06:58,478 --> 00:06:59,376
<i>Just get 'em out.</i>

224
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:01,280
<i>Get 'em out-- whoo, baby!</i>

225
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,713
- <i>Whoa! I burned myself on a rivet.</i>
- <i>Yeah...</i>

226
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:11,319
Mac, these blood tests are
going to show you the damage

227
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,321
that you've been doing to your
body, and my hope is that it

228
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,278
will incentivize you to finally
lose some of this disgusting

229
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:17,441
weight you've put on.

230
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,207
This is ridiculous, dude, okay?

231
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,260
We're getting older.

232
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:21,016
We're not going to
look 20 forever.

233
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,295
No, I am going to look 20
forever, Mac, because the

234
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,861
older I get, the more
vigilant I become.

235
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,566
All right, I don't eat lunch
anymore, for instance.

236
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,543
Yeah, and on odd days,
I don't eat breakfast.

237
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:29,644
That sounds miserable.

238
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,037
No, dude, it's not miserable.

239
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,255
Well, yeah, it is a little bit
miserable, but it has to be, man.

240
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,713
No pain, no gain.

241
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,276
I am also constantly in motion.

242
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,112
Like, right now, dude, I am
doing leg lifts that are

243
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,647
imperceptible to the human eye.

244
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,149
I call them hummingbirds.

245
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:46,554
And although I seem relaxed, I'm
actually incredibly tense at all times.

246
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:49,057
Dude, we've been
through this, okay?

247
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,291
I'm cultivating mass.

248
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,426
Stop staying that.

249
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:54,162
You are not cultivating mass, and
if you are, stop cultivating

250
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,329
and start harvesting.

251
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:56,330
Bro, check this out.

252
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,331
Try to move me.

253
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,766
Wow, I'm not going to try...
Try and move me, bro.

254
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:03,236
Take a running start.

255
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,204
Take a running start.

256
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,174
Excuse me.

257
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:11,010
Did you want me to read
these test results or not?

258
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,279
Yeah, I was just trying to...
trying to move him.

259
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,280
He's like a brick wall.

260
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:15,282
Yeah.

261
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,282
You try to move me, Doc.

262
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,284
No, no, no, you're...
Read the results, Doc.

263
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:21,054
Well, I see, uh, severe
dehydration here, multiple

264
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:23,690
vitamin deficiencies,
anemia, low blood pressure.

265
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,692
Ooh.

266
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,694
Mac, look, I don't want
you to fret, okay?

267
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,696
I'm going to get you on
my exercise program.

268
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,698
I'm going to get you
fit as a fiddle.

269
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,701
Uh, these are...
these are your results, Mr. Reynolds.

270
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,169
What? No, those can't be my...
my results.

271
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,304
I'm healthy as shit.

272
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:38,973
Well, uh, not according
to your tests.

273
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,642
I'm healthier
than you, bro.

274
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,910
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say you're healthy.

275
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,714
You have type 2
adult-onset diabetes.

276
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:50,049
Type 2 adult-onset diabetes?

277
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,617
What does that mean for me?

278
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:54,086
Well, that means you're going
to have to inject yourself

279
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,388
several times a day with
insulin, or else you probably

280
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:58,991
need to think about
losing a little weight.

281
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,593
Whoa.

282
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,628
But I'm healthy
besides the diabetes?

283
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:03,762
Um, no.

284
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,231
But I'm more healthier than he
is, I think is the point that

285
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,365
you're trying to make.

286
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,399
Even with the diabetes.

287
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:09,467
Dude, stop saying "diabetes!"

288
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:15,240
You sound like an ass...
You okay, dude?

289
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,442
I'm fine.

290
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,610
I just, uh...
been doing a lot of hummingbirds today.

291
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,612
I'm good.

292
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,614
Have you eaten anything today?

293
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:22,615
No.

294
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,617
All right, let's get
out of here, bro.

295
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:26,620
I'm going to get you
something to eat.

296
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:27,621
All right.

297
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,622
I'm going to lift you up.

298
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:30,624
What the hell?

299
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:32,626
I'm not as strong as
I thought, Dennis.

300
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,629
Okay, I've hurt my back.

301
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:40,866
I'm shit-faced.

302
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,869
Yeah, well, you downed that bottle
of schnapps like it was a soda pop.

303
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:46,237
Look, Roxy, I'm trying to give
you a second chance here, but

304
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,405
you're making it very difficult.

305
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,474
Hey, this jacket is awesome.

306
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,276
Ooh, and it's tighter
than dick skin, man.

307
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:54,278
Can you watch your
language, please, Roxy?

308
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:57,281
We're in a classy place with classy
clothes for classy people, okay?

309
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,283
Don't talk about dick skin.

310
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,284
Hi.

311
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:00,352
Can I help you with something?

312
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,353
No, thank you.

313
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:02,554
We're just trying some stuff on.

314
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,589
Um, okay.

315
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:06,225
Well, you are aware
that jacket is $500.

316
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,828
Are you implying we
can't afford that?

317
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:09,929
Can you?

318
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:11,064
That's none of your business.

319
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,165
Um, it's exactly my business.

320
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,165
Excuse me.

321
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,167
Screw your dick skin jacket, man.

322
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,168
Oh, no, no, no!

323
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:17,169
No, no, no, no, Roxy, Roxy!

324
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:18,170
Oh, God, no, don't do that.

325
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,172
How do you like me now, gay boy?

326
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,173
Well, now, okay, okay.

327
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:23,175
Don't call him gay, 'cause it'd
be one thing if he wasn't, but

328
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,176
he clearly is, so...
Is there a problem?

329
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:26,177
Yeah, there's a problem, man.

330
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:30,448
I'm trying to buy this coat, and
this asshole here is giving me shit.

331
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:31,882
You are aware of the price.

332
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,450
Well, here.

333
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,119
'Cause I have money.

334
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:36,287
Oh, shit!

335
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:39,490
Jerry, can I talk with you
in my office, please?

336
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,692
You have got to be kidding me.

337
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,794
Oh, oh, face, Jerry, face!

338
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,062
Take a hike!

339
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,096
Sorry about the gay stuff.

340
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,164
That did cross the line.

341
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,001
Jerry, please, my office.

342
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,402
Roxy!

343
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:52,803
Holy shit.

344
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,104
That was amazing.

345
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:57,641
You humiliated that salesman, and then
you had the capital to back it up.

346
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,043
I love you, Roxy.

347
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,112
Ooh, I got to meet a client.

348
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,213
No, no, no, Roxy, you don't
have to do that anymore.

349
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:04,248
You know what?

350
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,617
We should go find Frank, 'cause
he's got a surprise for you.

351
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,352
No, it's Tiger Woods.

352
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,720
It's Tiger Woods?

353
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:10,721
Yeah.

354
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,356
Okay, th-this whole thing
is blowing my mind.

355
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,826
Your life is way more glamorous
than what I was picturing.

356
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:16,860
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:21,032
Now, help me dig these
crack rocks out of my ass.

358
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,500
That's what I was picturing.

359
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,501
Yeah.

360
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,305
That's more like what
I was picturing.

361
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,741
Charlie, I feel like a sack
of shit in this thing.

362
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,743
You look good.

363
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:32,880
I feel like I'm a... I'm a four year
old going to my sister's wedding.

364
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:33,915
You're the limo driver.

365
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:34,916
You got to look the part, bud.

366
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,918
You don't look like
a millionaire.

367
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,920
I am a casual
millionaire from Texas.

368
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:39,920
You look like a farmer.

369
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,923
Frank, I got the whole
thing worked out.

370
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,924
Now, listen to me.

371
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,925
We got out on the date.

372
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,093
I come down with a slight cough.

373
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:46,094
Okay?

374
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,095
I ask to be taken home.

375
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,096
You take over.

376
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,097
You charm the hell out of her.

377
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,098
I'm so nervous.

378
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,434
You know how long it's been
since I've been with a non-pro?

379
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,802
Will you relax?

380
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,471
Oh, hello.

381
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,608
Tarnation!

382
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,343
You look as pretty as a peach.

383
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,579
Yes, you do!

384
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,983
Hoss Bonaventure, CEO.

385
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,753
Uh, this here is my
limo driver, Frank.

386
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:09,754
Hi.

387
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:11,823
Now, he's the finest driver
in all the land, so you gonna

388
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,124
get on just fine with him.

389
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,125
Hi.

390
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,125
Uh, hand down.

391
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,126
Only say hello once.

392
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,195
He's nervous!

393
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:21,232
All right, well, let's-let's...
let's do this thing.

394
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:22,633
Get your stuff and giddy on up.

395
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:23,668
Calm down.

396
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:24,668
You'll be good.

397
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:27,104
All right!

398
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:35,279
So, uh, how did you
make your fortune?

399
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:36,280
Hmm?

400
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,549
Oh, uh, well, uh, uh, hustlin'

401
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:40,285
and a-rasslin'.

402
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:41,586
Uh, you know, this and that.

403
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:44,690
Uh, made a decent penny in
boiled denims and, uh, the

404
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,258
bridge business mostly.

405
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:50,229
Uh, oh, Frank up there, though,
now, that man is rich in spirit.

406
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:51,864
He's rich in caricature.

407
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:55,201
Uh, and that's true fortune, if
you're asking me, to have that.

408
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,936
So you build bridges.

409
00:12:57,004 --> 00:13:00,906
Um, uh...
I-I'm kind of into bridges myself.

410
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:01,907
Yeah.

411
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:04,810
I... I-I found a whole case
of eggs under a bridge last

412
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,812
week-- perfect condition.

413
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:08,280
None of them missing.

414
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,582
None of them cra*** ced.

415
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,952
I mean, who in their right mind
throws away a perfectly good

416
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:15,620
case of eggs this day and age?

417
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:17,890
I mean, it's a sick
world, don't you think?

418
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,961
Ah, he's good with the conversation and...

419
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,396
Excuse me.

420
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:24,397
Excuse me.

421
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,399
I believe I'm coming down
with a bit of something here.

422
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,701
I got bit by a crab
under that same bridge.

423
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:29,702
Oh, did you?

424
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:31,704
Yeah. You ever been
bit by a crab, hon?

425
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,706
Can we maybe put this divider up?

426
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:36,310
Well, no, we don't want to
exclude a great man like Frank

427
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,313
from the conver...

428
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:40,881
Oh, my God!

429
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,083
Call 911!

430
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,117
No, it's okay.

431
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:44,652
I have a touch of consumption.

432
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:45,887
He's all right.

433
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,155
Why don't we drop him off?

434
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:52,294
You and I will go to dinner, OK?

435
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,899
I think I've been poisoned
by my constituents!

436
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,066
Oh, my God!

437
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:02,536
Can I offer you a nice
egg in this trying time?

438
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:03,938
Yeah, he's got an egg.

439
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:07,174
You might...

440
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:11,645
I better pull over, okay?

441
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:14,548
You know, you two can
go to dinner together.

442
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:16,049
Help me somebody!

443
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,418
Please, help me!

444
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,454
Aw, shit, Charlie, what the
hell went on back there?

445
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:24,859
I swallowed, like, a million
blood caplets 'cause I was gonna

446
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:28,396
cough, like, you know, a handful
of blood to make it it real.

447
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,599
And not I'm thinking, like,
you're not supposed to eat them

448
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,135
or something 'cause they're
making me really sick.

449
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,403
Aw, Charlie, you blew it.

450
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:37,072
You're the one talking about
eggs and crabs and shit.

451
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:37,739
I love eggs, Charlie.

452
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:38,640
I like eggs.

453
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,074
And I love crabs.

454
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,175
I like crabs.

455
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,644
And I love boiling denim
and banging whores!

456
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:46,113
I love boiling... Well...
And I don't care if anybody

457
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,348
doesn't like that about me.

458
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,116
They don't have to stick around!

459
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,250
Screw 'em!

460
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:50,984
You're right.

461
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,954
What's wrong with that chick?

462
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:54,989
I miss Roxy.

463
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:55,956
Yeah.

464
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,893
Roxy and and I are
made for each other.

465
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:03,432
Yeah. Tell you what, if
it's Roxy you want...

466
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:12,308
That's the last of it, I think.

467
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:16,963
Tiger Woods?

468
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,798
I cannot believe you invited
him over here, Roxy.

469
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:19,466
My place is a mess.

470
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,968
Oh, he's here. Are you ready?

471
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,970
I'm ready. I'm very excited.

472
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,074
Hello.

473
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:28,976
Who are you?

474
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,777
Tiger Woods.

475
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,745
Hey, Tiger.

476
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:32,479
Hey, girl.

477
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:34,981
You brought a friend?

478
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,649
Yeah.

479
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:36,316
Good. I like that.

480
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:36,984
Mm-hmm.

481
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,986
So, you ready to do this?

482
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:40,253
I know who you are.

483
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,354
Of course you do, honey.

484
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,388
I'm very famous.

485
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,457
No, no, no, no, hold on a second.

486
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,326
Roxy, this is not Tiger Woods.

487
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,660
What are you talking about?

488
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:48,862
This guy's an actor.

489
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,498
He definitely pretended to be
Donovan McNabb one time when I

490
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,632
tried out for the Eagles.

491
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,566
Donovan McNabb? Eagles?

492
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,169
I don't know what
she's talking about.

493
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:55,903
I play golf.

494
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,705
Okay, Roxy, see, this is exactly why
you gotta stop doing this shit.

495
00:15:58,774 --> 00:15:59,940
And, sir, seriously?

496
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,642
Okay, all right, all
right, I'm sorry.

497
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,776
You got me, all right?

498
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,512
I'm busted. I <i>am</i> an actor.

499
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,947
My name is Don Cheadle.

500
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,548
No, you're not Don...
What are you doing?!

501
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:08,216
What's going on?

502
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:11,686
I don't care who he is if he pays
me 500 bucks to rub my feet.

503
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,721
Did you say 500 bucks?

504
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:13,388
Mm-hmm.

505
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:14,055
To rub your feet?

506
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:14,722
Mm-hmm.

507
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,357
You don't have sex with him?

508
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,024
Mm-mm-mmm.

509
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,059
I'm into foot shit.

510
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:21,996
Interesting...
What shoe size are you, by the way?

511
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,766
Hey, your feet are bizarrely huge.

512
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,067
Man will go crazy for that.

513
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:29,171
I don't care for how you describe
them, but what are we talking here?

514
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,605
What kind of money are we talking?

515
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:34,142
I don't know maybe we could pop those
boots off and kick it around a bit.

516
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:36,678
Well, it never hurts
to talk, does it?

517
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:37,746
Just do it.

518
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,348
He's cute.

519
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,182
Oh, God.

520
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,351
Chimichanga, chimichanga, chimichanga,
chimichanga, chimichanga.

521
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,686
Mac, chimichangas are delicious.

522
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:45,753
I told you, dude.

523
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:46,554
So good, oh!

524
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,222
I told you.

525
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,125
Why would you not want to eat one of
these every single day of your life?

526
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:50,792
Oh, my God!

527
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:53,027
I mean, they're delicious,
they're full of carbs, which is

528
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,294
great for a pump.

529
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,629
And they're cheap as shit.

530
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,532
Hence the garbage bags
filled with them.

531
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,433
Exactly. No restrictions.

532
00:16:58,502 --> 00:16:59,200
No restrictions.

533
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,802
Oh, I love this no
restrictions thing, man.

534
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:03,605
Now in that vein, I want you to
take a look at that chimichanga.

535
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,640
I want you to say to yourself,
"Chimichanga, you are

536
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,542
delicious, but what
do I really want?"

537
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,410
What I really want?

538
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,978
What do you want more than
anything else in the entire world?

539
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,448
What do I want more than anything
else in this entire world?

540
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:15,282
Yes.

541
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,484
Crack.

542
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:22,423
Oh. I thought you were gonna say
pizza or buffalo wings or something.

543
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,291
Yeah, no, no, no.

544
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,325
You want crack?

545
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:25,026
Yeah, crack cocaine.

546
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,194
Now, I've never had crack.

547
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,596
Dude, you are going to love it.

548
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,664
I am?

549
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,398
It's so good.

550
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,466
Let's do it!

551
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,301
No restrictions, baby,
no restrictions.

552
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:33,969
No restrictions.

553
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,303
Aw, man, this is gonna
be awesome, dude.

554
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:36,905
Do you want some insulin?

555
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:37,572
Oh, shit.

556
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,740
Yo.

557
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,841
Uh-huh.

558
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,911
You did what now?

559
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,047
Oh, she is?

560
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,782
I don't get it, but
I don't need to.

561
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:47,950
Okay, we'll see you there.

562
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:48,817
Okay, bye.

563
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:52,522
Um, dude, so, apparently,
Charlie just puked blood all

564
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,525
over some lady in a limousine and Dee is
sucking off Don Cheadle or something?

565
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:58,294
And Frank wants to go ahead and get
married to Roxy as soon as possible.

566
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,462
So we got to fire down there.

567
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:02,131
Dude, we can get crack from Roxy.

568
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,067
Let's get crack from
Roxy, Okay, perfect.

569
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,202
Now do you want some
of this insulin?

570
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,270
No, I just want crack.

571
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,438
Okay, we'll get down there.

572
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:11,207
And on the way, let's fire down
to John Wanamaker's and get

573
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:14,010
ourselves a couple of
Tommy Bahama shirts.

574
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,012
Are you familiar?

575
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,784
Yeah, see what you mean
about these shirts, bro.

576
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,318
Yeah.
You'll grow into yours, buddy.

577
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,153
Yeah, comfy as shit.

578
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:23,987
They hide your fatness.

579
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:26,156
You know, they're ugly as all
hell, but I have a feeling

580
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,791
I'm gonna like 'em a lot more
when I'm high as shit on crack.

581
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:30,627
What's up, basticks?

582
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:33,463
Basticks? Is that how you're
gonna talk from now on?

583
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,732
Look, I'm not taking no shit
no more, so get used to it.

584
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,968
Also, I'm gonna
become a foot girl.

585
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,202
All right, gross. Whatever.

586
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,871
Frank, you ready?

587
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:41,538
Oh, yeah.

588
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:42,205
I'm ready.

589
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:44,341
Okay, Roxy, Frank would
like to say a few words.

590
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,142
Everybody.

591
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,943
Gather round.

592
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,644
Roxy... Frank.

593
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:52,649
You are good shit, and I
want to make this legit.

594
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:57,821
I'm still gonna pay you, but I want
you to stop banging other guys.

595
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,289
What do you say?

596
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,660
Want to be my wife or what?

597
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,031
Holy shit.

598
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,834
Oh-oh, my God.

599
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:12,204
Oh, my... Uh... ooh... Whoops.

600
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,038
Christ!

601
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:13,706
No, it's okay.

602
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:14,807
She does this from time to time.

603
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,509
She's had an excessive
amount to drink, so yeah.

604
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,610
Okay. Well, Roxy, get up.

605
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,247
Roxy... Come on, Roxy.

606
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:21,914
Roxy?

607
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,848
Big day for Frank here.

608
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,750
Roxy, we don't have
a ton of time, Rox.

609
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:25,885
Get up!

610
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,854
The bitch is dead!

611
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:29,021
How could she be dead?

612
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,758
I'm telling you her heart popped.

613
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:34,427
She <i>was</i> smoking crack in the
car the whole way here and also

614
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:35,361
all day long.

615
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,495
She got no pulse.

616
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:37,396
Oh, my God!

617
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:38,063
Holy shit!

618
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:38,831
Call 911!

619
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,399
Call an ambulance.

620
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:41,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,634
No, no, no. No, no, no!

622
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,702
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

623
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,436
Whoa, whoa, what?

624
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:45,403
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

625
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,171
Uh, we gotta think
this through, okay?

626
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,673
Dead hooker in my apartment?

627
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:49,707
That doesn't look good for me.

628
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,541
I'm covered in blood.

629
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,543
I mean, not good to have
a dead hooker, right?

630
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,645
It would kind of mess up our
second acts a little bit.

631
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,013
And I'll tell you guys something.

632
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,115
I smoked a little crack in
the car on the way over.

633
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,016
Oh, you bitch!

634
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:00,118
Oh, does she still have any?

635
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:00,785
Yeah, yeah.

636
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:01,619
> We can't leave her here.

637
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,387
No, no, we can't leave her here.

638
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,757
Um, let's, uh... Oh, God.

639
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:10,494
Okay, well, I mean... I don't want to
sound insensitive, but we could just

640
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,562
put her out in the hall.

641
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,297
We call in an anonymous tip.

642
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:17,033
So we're still calling 911...
Someone finds her.

643
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:18,067
...just from a pay phone.

644
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:22,170
This seems like the best thing to
do considering the circumstances.

645
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,238
Frank, what do you think?

646
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,106
I think Roxy would have
wanted it that way.

647
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:25,940
Well, there you go.

648
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:26,774
Frank would know.

649
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:27,642
I mean, that's it!

650
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:28,342
You would know, Frank.

651
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:29,710
Can I say a few words?

652
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:30,778
Make it nice.

653
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,946
Let's make the whole thing nice.

654
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:35,083
Really? I just want to
get her out of here.

655
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:40,355
Oh, nice.

656
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,658
Roxy, God bless you.

657
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:43,826
You were a good whore.

658
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:47,330
You serviced me like no
other whore ever did.

659
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:50,467
Not only my crank, but my heart.

660
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:54,238
And I'm gonna miss ya.

661
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:58,008
Amen.

662
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:04,560
So should we get the dead
whore out of the apartment?

663
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,126
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

664
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:16,796
