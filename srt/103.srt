1
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:06,047
Oh, there it is, Mac.
There it is.

2
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:08,054
I can't believe it's
finally arrived.

3
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:11,891
My God, <i>Thundergun Express:</i>
<i>The Unrated Director's Cut.</i>

4
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:14,360
<i>13 extra minutes of movie</i>
<i>in this one.</i>

5
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,462
<i>And it's unrated.</i>
<i>They were not able to rate it.</i>

6
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,064
<i>This is gonna be the best</i>
<i>Thanksgiving ever.</i>

7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,767
<i>Oh, yeah, absolutely, man.</i>
<i>Thundergun,</i> hoagies and four

8
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:23,102
extra seconds dedicated solely
to the dong shot.

9
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:24,904
Buddy, that's what
I'm thankful for.

10
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:26,572
So much better than
a traditional Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:27,974
Oh, yeah, dude, I hate
Thanksgiving.

12
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,542
What is that?
What am I supposed

13
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:31,711
to be thankful for exactly?
Who am I meant to be thanking,

14
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:33,146
right?
I've had to scratch

15
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:34,547
and claw for everything
I've got.

16
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,982
If anything, I should be
thanking myself.

17
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:39,152
- Yeah.
- Hey, man.

18
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:40,753
Welcome to Mahndo
Video.

19
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,389
How may we help you?
 What are you guys

20
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,558
doing here?
We own the store.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,561
We bought this bitch.
We wanted to invest in an

22
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:50,563
emerging market.
An emerging market?

23
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,565
Video stores are a dying market.
This is, like, one of the only

24
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,133
ones left.
Then we're gonna corner that

25
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:55,835
market.
Okay. Whatever.

26
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:57,837
Liam, what is on your eye?
Someone ate my eye at my

27
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,839
wedding.
Don't you remember, man?

28
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,841
The eyepatch is flesh-colored
to make people less

29
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:04,844
uncomfortable.
I'm way more uncomfortable.

30
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,846
Yeah, absolutely.
You look like a man who was

31
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:08,848
born without an eye, which is
way creepier than a man who lost

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,483
one.
Just get a black eyepatch, you

33
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:12,485
know?
Embrace it. Losing an eye is

34
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:14,120
badass.
It's not badass.

35
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:16,122
I have no depth perception!
It's all your fault.

36
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,757
What are you... How is it our
fault?

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
What are you talking about?
Let's not get into a whole

38
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,761
thing about missing eyes and
whose fault they are.

39
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:23,763
You know, we'll just rent the
video, and we'll be out of here.

40
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,765
You are not renting shit.
You are not welcome in this

41
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,834
store.
Your video-renting days are

42
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:30,103
over!
No, come on, don't do that,

43
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:34,507
dude.
Oh...

44
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,210
I-It's not even... it's not
even close.

45
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,278
I mean, I...
Let me get that for you.

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,014
Thanks, man.
Don't cut... don't...

47
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:44,150
Goddamn it.

48
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:47,954
All right, look,
just pay the man already.

49
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:49,956
We'll be done with it.
It's freezing in there.

50
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,991
No can do, Charlie.
It's the principle of the thing.

51
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,993
You guys having a
principle fight?

52
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,628
No, we're not having a
principle fight.

53
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,730
We're having a heat fight, okay?
'Cause our heat's broken, and

54
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,866
Hwang won't fix it until this
guy pays the rent.

55
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,767
This guy's not gonna pay the
rent till Hwang fixes the heat.

56
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,636
So you got one of those snafus,
where you got old assholes...

57
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:05,838
It's a deadlock.
It's a deadlock of butting

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,807
heads.
We got a disaster on our

59
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,775
hands, a disaster.
The McPoyles bought Mahndo

60
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,811
Video.
They revoked our membership.

61
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,913
You didn't get <i>Thundergun?</i>
<i>We didn't get shit!</i>

62
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:17,016
<i>Aw... Hang on.</i>
<i>Dee, why do our hoagies reek of</i>

63
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:19,152
<i>gasoline?</i>
<i>Maybe 'cause I got 'em at the</i>

64
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:21,154
<i>gas station, I guess.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

65
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:23,322
<i>Why didn't you get the ones</i>
<i>we like from the Wawa?</i>

66
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:25,391
<i>Because Gail the Snail works</i>
<i>at the Wawa, okay?</i>

67
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:27,493
<i>And we got mad beef.</i>
<i>She won't serve me.</i>

68
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,095
<i>This is a mess.</i>
<i>This is a mess.</i>

69
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:31,164
<i>We can't get the sandwiches we</i>
<i>want, we can't get the videos we</i>

70
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,166
<i>want, my apartment's an icebox.</i>
<i>Thanksgiving's gonna be ruined,</i>

71
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:34,767
<i>you know.</i>
<i>It's not just Thanksgiving,</i>

72
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,769

<i>You know what the real problem</i>

73
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,404
<i>is?</i>
<i>We have too many beefs all over</i>

74
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,406
<i>town.</i>
<i>It's jamming us up.</i>

75
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,408
<i>We made a lot of enemies over</i>
<i>the years.</i>

76
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,410
<i>We have made enemies.</i>
<i>We got to do something about</i>

77
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:48,014
<i>this, guys, okay?</i>
<i>So I say we use Thanksgiving as</i>

78
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:52,518
<i>an opportunity to squash some of</i>
<i>those beefs.</i>

80
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,065
All right, guys, this is
really coming together.

81
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:23,905
It's looking good.

82
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,089
You know... you know, this was the
original meaning of Thanksgiving anyway.

83
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,166
The Pilgrims and Indians had
beef.

84
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,167
So what did they do?

85
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,168
They got together, they sat at a

86
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,169
table, they ate some delicious

87
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,170
food and they squashed that

88
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,171
beef.

89
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,206
And that's exactly what we're

90
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,207
gonna do.

91
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:37,208
Mac and I are gonna squash the

92
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,209
McPoyle beef, you guys are gonna

93
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,210
squash Hwang...

94
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:41,045
And you guys are gonna squash
with Bruce.

95
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,313
What?
Say what?

96
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:43,948
Bruce Mathis, I invited him.
What?!

97
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,349
What? What?
Why would you do that?

98
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:48,019
Because he is your dad, and
Thanksgiving is a holiday for

99
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,621
families.
I also invited Charlie's mom, my

100
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:52,623
mom and my dad, but they didn't
want to come.

101
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,625
So just Bruce?
You know what, it's okay.

102
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,627
We'll-we'll manage very
carefully, and it'll be fine.

103
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,629
Hey, maybe we can squeeze some
money out of the guy.

104
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,631
I'm-I'm confused though.
In this whole scenario with the

105
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,833
Pilgrim and the Indians, which
one are we?

106
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:05,069
The Pilgrims.
They came out on top.

107
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,704
I don't know about that, Frank.

108
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,973
The Indians, they've got sports
teams, they've got casinos.

109
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,975
They're a very celebrated
people.

110
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,977
Yeah, that's true, actually.
You don't see people walking

111
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,979
around with the tall hat with a
buckle on the front.

112
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:17,348
Makes no difference though in
our scenario with what we're

113
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,417
trying to accomplish here, okay?
They buried the hatchet.

114
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:21,552
That's what they did, and that's
what we're gonna do.

115
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:24,522
Okay, so, to that end, here's
the plan: once the guests

116
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:28,025
arrive, we will ply them with
liquor and then I will present

117
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,028
to them this peace treaty that I
will have them sign.

118
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,097
Why do you always want people
to sign creepy documents?

119
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, Frank, once
something's in writing, that

120
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:38,002
means it's set in stone.
Then no one can do anything to

121
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:40,004
stop me.
When do you want me to serve

122
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:42,006
the squash and the beef?
S-So we're literally serving

123
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,008
squash and beef?
You said we're squashing

124
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,642
beef.

125
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,610
I thought it would be part of
the ceremony to have squash and

126
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,612
beef.
Yeah, it's all about the

127
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:50,247
ceremony.
That's why I got this bucket of

128
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,249
dirt and a hatchet, so we can
have a ceremonial burying of the

129
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,251
hatchet.
Right. And after we do that,

130
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,253
we're going to wipe the slate
clean.

131
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:59,190
Wait, no, guys, look, this is
all very on the nose and totally

132
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:02,226
- unnecessary.
- Where's food?

133
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:04,228
Walk right in, why don't you,
Hwang?

134
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,963
Thanksgiving, food.
Yeah, Thanksgiving...

135
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,965
Thanksgiving, yeah, go sit
down.

136
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,800
Have a seat, have a seat, man!

137
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,535
What do you live in, a barn?
Have a seat, Hwang.

138
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,504
Guys, listen, regroup, regroup.

139
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:16,707
Let's put on some music, lighten
the mood and get this party

140
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,243
started.
(Tom Tom Club's "Genius of Love"

141
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:21,545
playing)

142
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:28,085
Dee.
Hmm?

143
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,087
Go break the ice.
What?

144
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,722
Yeah.
Why me?

145
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,324
Yeah, yeah, someone's got to
do it.

146
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:37,261
Just go to go over there...
Go, go, go.

147
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,730
S-Some good crackers.
Huh?

148
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:43,234
Mm. Mm.
They are delicious.

149
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:45,236
Yeah.
What's wrong? Is it the eye?

150
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:47,238
Why would... I don't even
know why you would say

151
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,839
that-that.
They made me feel

152
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,474
self-conscious.
Did they?

153
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,177
Yeah. Is it off-putting?
Or does it look real?

154
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:56,480
The skin tone is a... is a...
a good match.

155
00:05:56,482 --> 00:06:00,117
Oh, well, when you move the
other one, I guess I can tell a

156
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:04,688
little bit, if I'm being honest.

157
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,690
Hey, turkeys,
gobble, gobble.

158
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,692
Cricket, what the hell are
you doing here?

159
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,694
Word around town is you guys
are squashing beef.

160
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,696
We don't have beef with you.
You don't have beef with me?

161
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:15,099
I was a priest before I got
involved with you guys.

162
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,700
Unbelievable.
Look, we have enough on our

163
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,602
plate right now, Crick.
Come on, guys, let me stay.

164
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,604
I-I'll eat the gristle.
You can eat it off the floor

165
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:22,540
like a dog, how 'bout that?
Now you're just creating more

166
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,542
beef.
I don't mind.

167
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,177
Woof, woof, baby.
Great.

168
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,812
Look at that. Beef squashed,
huh?

169
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,814
Okay, wait, wait, hold on a
second.

170
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,549
Here, sign this treaty.
Mmm, yeah.

171
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,184
It'll be official.
Good.

172
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,186
Boom, all right, get out of
here.

173
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:37,721
Go, go, go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:54,638
Okay, let's get started.
I really like your room,

175
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,041
Mac.
Thank you.

176
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,476
Yeah, great.
Have a seat, guys.

177
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:03,581
Um, now, I...
Yeah.

178
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,549
Yeah, yeah, yeah, a little to
the... to your right.

179
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,818
Okay, good.
Now, I know we've had our

180
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,021
differences in the past.
Things have been a little tense

181
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:12,423
between us.
What is this?

182
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,825
What is what?
Standing.

183
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,827
What's with the standing?
You're lording.

184
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:19,029
We're not lording, we're just
having a conversation.

185
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,865
Yeah, we're just...
Some kind of a status thing?

186
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:23,033
A power move?
Some kind of power play?

187
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,768
Come on, guys. No.
It's not a power move!

188
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,737
We're having a conversation.
There's one chair.

189
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,672
Bring it down.
Just bring it down on the

190
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,741
haunches.
You want us to squat?

191
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,177
Haunch it. Arch down.
Oh, Christ, fine.

192
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,678
Just do it, just do it.
All right, look...

193
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,547
Just do it. Give him the...
Guys, look, I know we've had

194
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,349
our differences in the past.
Things have been very, very

195
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,551
awkward, but it's time for us to
move forward with our

196
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:42,720
relationship, all right?
It's time to hit the reset

197
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:45,122
button, wouldn't you say?
Here's this. Open it up.

198
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,558
Mm-hmm.
It's your gift.

199
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,960
What the hell is this?
It's a peace treaty.

200
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:52,396
We need you to sign that.
I thought I was getting an

201
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,765
- eye.
- An eye?

202
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,967
Why would you think that?
You kept making comments.

203
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,270
You were hinting about eyes.
We're not giving you an eye!

204
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,572
Where the Christ would we get
an eye?

205
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:03,874
And if we did get an eye, how
would we attach it to you?

206
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,076
I'm not signing shit until I
get an eye. You owe me.

207
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:08,445
Give him your eye.
You want me to give him my

208
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,814
eye?
Mm-hmm.

209
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,883
You realize how preposterous
that is?

210
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,618
Okay, then apologize.
Apologize for what?

211
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,620
For everything!
For all of it!

212
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,555
This isn't...
It's not about apology.

213
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:20,391
We're not apologizing.
We're not apologizing, okay?

214
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,259
Nobody's apologizing.
No one's admitting guilt or

215
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:24,461
anything.
We've all done something wrong.

216
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,497
Okay, it's just about... it's
just about, like, you know,

217
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:30,634
moving forward, moving on.
Look, all you have to do is

218
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:37,308
apologize, and I'll sign it.
Give us a second.

219
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,778
All right.
How are we gonna get this eye?

220
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,616
I don't know.♪

221
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:54,191
Come on, come on, give me some.

222
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,160
Eat the... eat the... you
know, the skins if you got to

223
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,329
eat something.
I'll eat the skins.

224
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,197
I'll always eat the skins.
I love the skins.

225
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,132
It's where all the vitamins are.
What kind of meat is that,

226
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:04,034
Charlie? Doesn't smell right.
It's not grade A meat.

227
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,970
You know, I'm not gonna get
grade A meat. Just...

228
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,972
Why are you guys hovering?

229
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:10,140
Don't hover. Answer the door!
Get the door!

230
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:12,543
All right.
Yeah, all right!

231
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:14,712
I'm gonna fight with
you.

232
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,947
What?!
Snail, what the hell are you

233
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,149
doing here? Who invited you?
Dee, we invited her, okay?

234
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,051
Enough is enough.
You got to squash it with Snail,

235
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:22,987
all right?
We want to go to the Wawa again,

236
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,855
all right?
Goddamn it.

237
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,658
Hey, you want some beef?
You want some squash?

238
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,659
You want to pack some beef?

239
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:30,661
Listen, could you just
swallow your spit and then

240
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:32,663
breathe, and then we can talk?
Then breathe, and close your

241
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,798
mouth.

242
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,700
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God, it was sad for a

243
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,702
second, and now it's right back
to... rah, making me do the...

244
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,671
See a doctor!
Go see a doctor.

245
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,706
All right, oh, let's just...
All right, hold on. Um...

246
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,641
Let's compromise.
Is there something that we can

247
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:46,410
do to just, you know, patch this
up between you and Dee?

248
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,312
I want her to be my best
friend, yo.

249
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,214
Oh, well, you know what?
That's not gonna happen, so...

250
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,082
Yeah, that's too much.
Okay...

251
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:53,684
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Is there a compromise?

252
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:55,152
Is there anything?
How about just for today?

253
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,387
Just for today?
Together.

254
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,988
Okay, and then I get my
convenience store to be

255
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,590
convenient to me again, that's
the deal?

256
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:01,225
Word is bond, yo.
Okay. Okay, yeah, that sounds

257
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,028
good, let's do it. Yes, okay.
All right, good.

258
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,695
Frank, Hwang, you're up.
Let's go.

259
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:06,997
Okay.

260
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:24,758
All right, well, somebody say
something.

261
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,336
These crackers need more salt.

262
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:31,507
I agree.
Okay, well... they're

263
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,110
extremely salty, but-but good.
That's a start.

264
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:36,479
I mean, you know, you guys agree
about something.

265
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:38,881
Hey! All right.
My doctor say, no salt.

266
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,284
Mine, too.
Doctors are shit!

267
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:45,488
Goddamn medicine men, trying
to tell me how to eat my food.

268
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,890
They're all shit.
Well, look at that.

269
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,793
You guys agree about something!
Look at you two-- two extremely

270
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,863
hardheaded, unhealthy old men
who refuse to listen to doctors.

271
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,566
Come on, you guys are, like...
Can we work this out?

272
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,168
All right, Hwang, what if Frank
gives you, like, half the rent

273
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,405
now, then you fix the heat?!
And then, he gives you the other

274
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:06,008
half when the job's done?
It's okay.

275
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,377
Yeah?
All right, that's a deal.

276
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,813
That's a squashed beef.
Frank, you.

277
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:15,818
Oh, as a matter of fact...
I could give the whole month's

278
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,187
rent right here.
Well, that'd be... good.

279
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:20,590
I'll take it.
Yeah, but I'm not gonna do

280
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:23,025
it, because I'm not gonna let
you beat me, because you're a

281
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:25,394
lousy son of a bitch.
You're a dog!

282
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:27,396
I'm a dog, you're a dog, huh?
Wt, wait, wait, wait.

283
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,398
How's that? Huh?
You're a fire dog!

284
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,601
Plenty more where this came
from.

285
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,603
I could heat that apartment all
winter, huh? You want it? Aah...

286
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:36,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fire dog.
Aw!

287
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,074
You're trying to burn me!
Just give us an eye.

288
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,443
You don't need both of them.
I only have one good working

289
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:42,678
eye.
Yeah, but I think it might be

290
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
better if you're blind anyway.
You know, it's gonna heighten

291
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,682
all your other senses.
Let me think about it.

292
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:48,684
I'll think about it.
Okay, give it some thought.

293
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:50,686
Give it some thought.
I'll think about it.

294
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,688
All right, well, we'll work
that angle.

295
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,857
All right, just...

296
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,759
Ooh, maybe that's Bruce.
Oh, yeah. Hey, how'd you get

297
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:58,628
him down here anyway?
I told him that his kids

298
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,396
wanted to see him for
Thanksgiving, and that you guys

299
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:02,231
wanted to be one big happy
family again.

300
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,266
Oh, nice.
Hey.

301
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,556
Who's this jabroni?
I have no idea.

302
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,325
Slam the door on his face.
See you, bozo.

303
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,260
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Actually, I know who this guy

304
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,262
is. Holy shit!
Dude, this is the guy that Frank

305
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,264
and Dee mistook for Bruce, and
Frank got that bad intel, so

306
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,266
they went to his apartment,
instead of Bruce's apartment.

307
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,268
And then we blew up his car.
Blew the shit out of his car.

308
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,270
Oh, my God.
Wait a minute.

309
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,673
That was you guys?
Huh? No.

310
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,908
I don't even know what you're
talking about.

311
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,110
Uh...
Happy Thanksgiving.

312
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,279
Yeah, yeah.
Wait, wait. Please.

313
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,281
Are my kids in there?
Somebody wrote me a note and

314
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,483
said that my kids wanted to see
me?

315
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,686
I haven't seen 'em since my wife
left me.

316
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,688
Are they in here? Sabrina?
Oh, this is bad.

317
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,923
Yeah. Oh.
Marco? Daddy's here.

318
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,125
Oh, my God.
We really opened up a can of

319
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,294
worms.
It's a bit messy.

320
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,296
The good news is, seems that the
kids thing took his mind off the

321
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,498
car thing, so, maybe it'll work
itself out.

322
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,934
Okay, good.
All right.

323
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,303
Mac.
Hey.

324
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,305
Hey, thanks for calling, man.
So, where are the kids?

325
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,474
I can't wait to see those little
rug rats.

326
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,476
It's been forever.
I'm sure they're around

327
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,478
somewhere.
Go ahead and mingle, and maybe

328
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,447
you'll find 'em.
My kids aren't really here,

329
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,449
are they?
Uh... no.

330
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,317
No. No, I lied about that.
Thank God. Let's get

331
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,319
shit-housed, right, guys?
What a piece of shit that guy

332
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,488
is.
Yeah, he's a real piece of

333
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,490
shit, yeah.
Oh, my God.

334
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,459
What the hell is Ponderosa
doing here?

335
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,494
Well, he's the one that's
responsible for Liam's eye, so

336
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,396
we figured, you know, he shows
up, it shifts the blame from us

337
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,398
to him, and, worst case
scenario, they'll take his eye.

338
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,333
Oh, my God, this is getting
way too confusing.

339
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,335
We got too many beefs.
I can't keep up.

340
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,304
God, Dee, we got it.
Honk, honk, honk, honk, honk.

341
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,406
Too many beefs, we got it.
I'm not honking. I'm just...

342
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,408
I'm expressing something...
I'll admit it, it's getting

343
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,543
confusing, there's a lot of
people here.

344
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,545
See?
I'll take some of the blame

345
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,326
for that. I did invite...
Let us take the lead.

346
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,542
We got it, we got it.
Okay.

347
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:41,221
Can't get it to stay.
There you go.

348
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:52,190
Hi, uh, everybody, I'd like

349
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,430
to say something, please.
Uh, could I have your attention,

350
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,065
please?
I'd like to say something, yeah.

351
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,934
Um, so, the Pilgrims hated the
Indians and the Indians, they

352
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,470
despised the Pilgrims.
Yeah.

353
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,806
But nonetheless, on
Thanksgiving, they got together,

354
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,909
right, and it wasn't about
apologizing to each other.

355
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,478
"Aw..."
It wasn't about admitting guilt.

356
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,882
Won't do that. Okay?
It was just about making the

357
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,984
peace-- that was all that it was
about.

358
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:17,386
And if the Indians knew how to
sign shit, they probably

359
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:19,588
would've signed a peace treaty.
Right? So that's what we're

360
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,257
gonna do.
We're gonna make peace with each

361
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,259
other, and we're gonna get it in
writing.

362
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,261
All right? Is everybody amenable
to that?

363
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:28,164
Sound good?
Great, uh, so we'd like to

364
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,767
begin with Bill Ponderosa.
Yes.

365
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,171
It's not... There's no need

366
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,173
to clap.
It's not a clapping event.

367
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:40,176
No. Right. So...
Okay, so, um, Bill, do you have

368
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:42,411
something you'd like to admit to
someone here?

369
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,980
Yes, actually, I do.
Uh, I once broke into Dee's

370
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:48,484
apartment and sniffed on her
panties.

371
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:52,922
What? Goddamn it! Beef!
No, I got beef with that.

372
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,191
Uh, can we, um... Just stay
on track.

373
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:58,527
Um... Bill, is there something
you want to say to the McPoyles?

374
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,966
Oh, um... Hey, hey.
I love that painted-on eye, man.

375
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:06,535
That is fun.
No. No, wait. No, no.

376
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:10,439
Okay. No, no, no.
All right, hey, hey, hey!

377
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,975
Everybody stop clapping.
All right, Liam, Bill's the one

378
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,945
who put bath salts in the punch
at your wedding, all right?

379
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:18,147
He's the one who is responsible
for your empty eyehole.

380
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,316
Is this true, man?
Maybe. I...

381
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,318
The only thing I remember from
that night is my sponsor Frank

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
giving me the green light to get
shit-housed.

383
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,955
That's true.
That happened.

384
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,023
I'll back that up.
Then it's your fault.

385
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,192
You owe my brother an eye!
All right, settle down!

386
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:31,827
Settle... Take it easy, all
right?

387
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,829
Don't drag him into your beef
'cause I need him to focus on

388
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,464
ours here.
Hey, Frank, I'm giving this

389
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:38,367
guy a handy under the table.
Are you jealous?

390
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:42,037
She's mashing it.

391
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,708
She does that.
I'm very aroused.

392
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,044
Very good.
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.

393
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:51,046
Which one of you knows my
ex-wife and when are my kids

394
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,149
getting here?
They'll get here. Just...

395
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,317
Who's this jabroni?
Uh, this is the gentleman who

396
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:58,654
we mistook for Bruce Mathis.
Right, yep, and then we blew

397
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,890
up his car.
Don't say that!

398
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:03,058
A-All of this, and it was you
guys.

399
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,327
You owe me a car.
Whoa, easy, man!

400
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,230
That's a big leap right there.
Buddy, buddy, um, what's the

401
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,232
deal with your kids?
Y-You haven't see 'em in a

402
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,867
while.
Did you do something?

403
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,270
Is it... Was it your fault?
Oh. I have a horrible drug

404
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,039
problem.
Ooh, I hear you.

405
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,375
I know that game, huh?
You want to do a bump here?

406
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:21,510
Yeah, of course I want a bump.

407
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:24,113
I'll have a few of those
delicious nose clams.

408
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:27,449
Frank, no, come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:29,451
Don't clap for that!
What? I can't have squash?

410
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,120
I can't have blow?
We need you to focus!

411
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,788
Sign the damn treaty!
All right, you know what, Hwang,

412
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,223
you sign the treaty.
I'll sign it.

413
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,925
Oh, gross! Don't touch me
with that hand!

414
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:37,760
Put your hand over here.
I'll take sloppy seconds.

415
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,562
Absolutely not.
Mash me, baby. Mash me.

416
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,964
No mashing at the table!
Stop mashing, all right?

417
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,033
Come on. Goddamn it, Frank, I'm
starting to think I have beef

418
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,634
with <i>you!</i>
<i>Yeah, us, too!</i>

419
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,204
<i>Okay, I have an idea.</i>
<i>It's time now to wipe the slate</i>

420
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,206
<i>clean.</i>
<i>No, you said we were gonna do</i>

421
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,241
<i>the hatchet thing first!</i>
<i>Don't worry about the hatchet</i>

422
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:53,876
<i>thing, okay?</i>
<i>That was an unsanctioned move.</i>

423
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,444
<i>Well, none of these moves are</i>
<i>working!</i>

424
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:58,848
<i>We got to do something else!</i>

425
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:07,556
<i>Food fight! Food fight!</i>
<i>I guess!</i>

426
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:10,626
<i>What?!</i>
<i>No!</i>

427
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:23,672
<i>Sign the treaty!</i>
<i>You owe me an eye, Frank!</i>

428
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:35,985
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

429
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:38,254
<i>Uh, this was a bad idea.</i>
<i>We stirred up too much</i>

430
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:40,823
<i>conflict.</i>
<i>Yeah. It smells like smoke.</i>

431
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,825
<i>Is something burning?</i>
<i>I think it's coming from your</i>

432
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:47,329
<i>room, dude.</i>
<i>What?!</i>

433
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,498
<i>My room's on fire.</i>
<i>Why is my room on fire?</i>

434
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
<i>I may have started a money</i>
<i>fire.</i>

435
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,135
<i>Why would you start a fire in</i>
<i>my room, Frank?</i>

436
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,204
<i>I don't know, I don't know.</i>
<i>We got to think, we got to</i>

437
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,273
<i>think.</i>
<i>Think, think.</i>

438
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:01,543
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

439
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,212
<i>So we're just gonna lock them</i>
<i>in there?</i>

440
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,214
<i>They're definitely gonna burn</i>
<i>to death.</i>

441
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,849
<i>Okay, guys, nobody's gonna</i>
<i>burn, all right?</i>

442
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,851
<i>There's a fire escape.</i>
<i>We'll call 911. We just need to</i>

443
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,552
<i>buy a little time so we can get</i>
<i>the hell out of here.</i>

444
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:12,554
<i>I feel like we're just</i>
<i>creating more beef.</i>

445
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,823
<i>Which we will not resolve.</i>
<i>Beefs are best left simmering</i>

446
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,492
<i>under the surface-- I've learned</i>
<i>that now.</i>

447
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,494
<i>The best thing to do with a</i>
<i>beef is jam it deep down inside</i>

448
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,496
<i>and then press forward.</i>
<i>What are we gonna do now?</i>

449
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,498
<i>You know, we could just buy</i>
<i>Thundergun</i> and go to a

450
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,133
different Wawa.
Yeah, it's a little

451
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:26,135
inconvenient, but it's better
than facing our problems.

452
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,137
Yeah, or saying we're sorry,
which I'm not doing.

453
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:30,072
Hell, no, I don't do that.
All right, you want to go

454
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,740
back to my place, get some
blankets, bundle up?

455
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,876
Just us? No one else?
That's what I'm thankful for.

456
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,878
We don't need to get along with
anybody else-- we got each

457
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,513
other.
Yeah, screw everybody else.

458
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:39,682
I hate people who are
different than me, you know?

459
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,483
Why pretend?
(inside There's a fire

460
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:42,851
escape right here.

461
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:45,354
Fire escape.
Out the window.

462
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,833
Who's got me? Man down.

463
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:50,801
I right back here, guys.
Who's got me? Guys?

464
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,230
Hello? Hello?

465
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:04,720
