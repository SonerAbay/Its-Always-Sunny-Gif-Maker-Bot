1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,732
<i>- On the side.
- You didn't do that on purpose.</i>

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,536
<i>- Otherwise that would have been a great shot.
- Watch this. Side pocket.</i>

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,977
- Holy shit!
- What?

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,175
"Christopher Murray, a teacher
at St. Vincent's Elementary...

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,344
has been accused of sexually abusing
two former students."

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,446
- St. Vincent's? That's that school you went to, right, Mac?
- Yeah, me and Charlie.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,457
What else does it say?

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,222
"Murray has been the physical education teacher
and boys' basketball coach for 25 years."

9
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,286
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,094
Ah. "The accusers are two brothers
whose names are being withheld...

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,000
"but the investigation
will focus on the mid-1980s...

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,300
"as the time period for alleged abuse.

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,863
The police are hoping
more young men will come forward."

14
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,637
- Wow. That's horrible.
- Did this guy teach you guys?

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,702
- Yeah.
- No.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,839
Yes, he did.
We were in the same class.

17
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,611
No. Yeah. Well, no,
I didn't like it though.

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,780
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I didn't like that class.

19
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,847
- What?
- I gotta go!

20
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,991
Holy shit.

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,796
Charlie got molested.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,331
<i>When dealing with molestation,
the first step is always understanding.</i>

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,392
So we need to take a moment
and assess the situation. Write this down.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,906
What? No, look. First of all, we can't
sit around and let him wallow in it.

25
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,999
And second of all, the first step is
acknowledgment. So I better write that down.

26
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,976
<i>- No. No, no.
- Whoa! What, guys...</i>

27
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,536
<i>What the hell are you guys
talking about?</i>

28
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,208
Sweet Dee and I took psychology at Penn,
so let the grown-ups talk.

29
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,217
- Okay? Thank you.
- Okay?

30
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,480
<i>Listen. I think we need
to have an intervention.</i>

31
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,751
You know, bring his friends and family
together for support.

32
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,758
Yeah, that's a good idea.

33
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,454
Let's tell everybody Charlie knows
that he got blown by a gym teacher.

34
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,259
Then we'll throw him a little surprise party,
celebrate the occasion.

35
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,358
Okay, you know what?
You being a smartass... not helping Charlie.

36
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who said anything about getting blown?

37
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:23,000
The article didn't specify what type of abuse
it was. It could have been anything.

38
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,510
Yeah, but do you think he got blown?

39
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,877
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know? Probably got blown.

40
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,508
Which is why I think
you need to reconsider my idea.

41
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:35,020
Okay. You know what? Stop. I'm sorry.
We need to clarify something here.

42
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,249
Do you think that Murray
blew these guys?

43
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,848
Why are you so obsessed with
the blowing aspect of all this?

44
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,861
Because I knew these two brothers
that the article was talking about.

45
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,227
The McPoyle twins...
Ryan and Liam. Okay?

46
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,756
They were the type of kids that would blow
snot bubbles and rub 'em over each other.

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,497
They were gross, and they smelled
like a couple of unwiped assholes.

48
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,505
<i>So what?</i>

49
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,508
Well, if Murray is, like, fondling
or touching them, whatever...

50
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,012
I get it, all right?
But if he's dishing out blow jobs, come on.

51
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,047
- I just don't understand.
- What do you not get?

52
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,709
- What are you talking about?
- You're not getting this?

53
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,618
I was in that class with them, all right?
I was with those guys!

54
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,558
- Um, are you okay, dude?
- No, dude. I'm not okay.

55
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,693
How come you're getting so upset?

56
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,238
The police are asking for
more young men to come forward.

57
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,070
That means there are more guys out there
who've been blown.

58
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,804
<i>- What are you looking for?
- Photographs. I have photographs.</i>

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,176
- Oh, my God. You have photographs of it?
- Oh! Okay.

60
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,272
Listen, are you trying to say
that you got molested?

61
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,341
Okay, look at this.
Look at this guy, huh?

62
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,252
I was cute.
I was energetic. I was fun.

63
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,018
I mean, what exactly
was this prick looking for?

64
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,524
- What are you...
- Sorry?

65
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,960
If the McPoyles got blown
and Charlie got blown...

66
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,327
then why didn't I get blown?

67
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,867
- You're goin' to hell, dude.
- Seriously.

68
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,837
Yo! McPoyle!

69
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,847
Hey, open up!

70
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,212
Hey, Charlie. Long time no see.

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,885
- What do you want?
- Is your brother here, man? I gotta talk to you guys.

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,554
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

73
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,088
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,727
Come on, man.
I need to talk to you guys. Go. Move. Go.

75
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,930
Go. Come on.

76
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,497
- I'm not gonna walk in front of you! Go.
- Just come in.

77
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,102
- No, you go first, and I will follow you.
- Shut the door.

78
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,839
<i>I will shut the door.</i>

79
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,347
- Whoa. That was really weird.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,577
Well, this confirms it.
He definitely got molested.

81
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,882
Ugh. We gotta get in there.

82
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,650
- Get... We gotta get in there?
- Yes.

83
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,420
You can't just thrust yourself
in the position of caregiver like that.

84
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,156
"Caregiver"? Why are you
throwing around big words?

85
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,063
- I actually majored in psych, so...
- You failed all your classes.

86
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,158
- So?
- I had a minor, and I passed all mine.

87
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,171
Well, you know what? Three-quarters
of a major is bigger than a whole minor.

88
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,867
- I don't even know how to respond to that.
- That doesn't surprise me.

89
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,934
Well, it shouldn't because
what you said is really dumb, you know.

90
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,003
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, it is.

91
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,879
- That was good. I liked that one.
- I felt good about it.

92
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,880
- So did you want a beverage of some kind?
- No! Where's your brother?

93
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,585
We just stepped out of the shower.
He'll be down in a minute.

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,128
Listen, you guys can't go...

95
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,892
- Did you just say "we"?
- What?

96
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,331
Did you just say,
"We just stepped out of the shower"?

97
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,604
I said "he."

98
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,409
Right. Okay. Listen.
I heard about the Coach Murray thing.

99
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,242
You guys cannot go to the police
and say that he molested you.

100
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,339
- Why not?
- Because he didn't molest you!

101
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,441
That's true, but he's a dick,
and we hated him.

102
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,078
- This is our chance for revenge. You want in?
- No!

103
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,145
<i>I think you do.</i>

104
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,994
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Ryan.

105
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,723
I don't know if you've been paying
attention to the news recently...

106
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,493
but there are millions
to be made here, my friend.

107
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,731
Oh, sure, there's the classic route
of priest molestation...

108
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,272
but we thought
we'd mix it up a bit.

109
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,672
We're going after
the whole damn school board.

110
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,736
If you want in on the team, we could
probably get a nice class-action suit going.

111
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:25,375
Okay. Okay, first of all, there are people
out there who actually have been molested.

112
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,284
And you guys are gonna exploit that
for your own personal gain?

113
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,447
You assholes are securing
your place in hell.

114
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,822
- We thought about it. We're willing to roll the dice.
- I won't let you do it.

115
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,225
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- Oh, no, you won't, Charlie.

116
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,287
- Oh, yes, I will.
- Oh, my friend, I'm afraid not.

117
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,825
- And why not?
- We'll tell the cops the whole thing was your idea.

118
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,872
We should tell the cops that
that fat dickhead gym teacher...

119
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,307
we had in junior high molested us...

120
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,777
and just sue the shit out of him!

121
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,838
- L... I was joking.
- Really?

122
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,907
I'm not joking though.
I'm not joking. I'm really not.

123
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,953
I wouldn't even joke
about something like that.

124
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,920
We should do it. I wanna do it.

125
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,957
Shit.

126
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,492
We'd hate to have to put this
whole thing on your shoulders.

127
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,619
- Shit.
- So you're gonna have to keep your mouth shut.

128
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,256
You don't have to join us,
but if anyone asks you point-blank...

129
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,562
Your ass got molested.

130
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,864
Otherwise,
we're talking conspiracy charges.

131
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,372
And prison can be a bad place...

132
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,035
for someone like you, Charlie.

133
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,101
A very bad place.

134
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,879
Soon as Charlie comes out, we gotta
grab him, take him back to the bar...

135
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,516
get him liquored up and tell him,
"We know you got molested."

136
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,583
Gonna have to disagree with you, Sis.

137
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,959
I think we need to ease him into it.
There he is.

138
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,834
Okay, you know what? Dr. Gainer
used to say that in situations like this...

139
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,894
Dr. Gainer?
That guy was an idiot.

140
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,906
- He was not.
- Yes, he was.

141
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,942
- Talk about molesters. That guy...
- He didn't molest me.

142
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,842
- I had sex with him 'cause I wanted to.
- You had sex with Dr. Gainer?

143
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,903
- Of course I did.
- No, you had... Oh!

144
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,915
- He was a hot older man.
- Gross!

145
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,077
Okay. You know what? You have no room
to talk. All the girls you've molested.

146
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,213
Whoa, whoa. Don't start throwing
that word around like it's meaningless, okay?

147
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,223
- This is serious.
- Fine.

148
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,952
- Fine.
- Great.

149
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,562
Molester.

150
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,410
- Hey, Coach Murray!
- Yeah?

151
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,412
It's me... Mac!

152
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,812
I don't know what this shit is all about.

153
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,785
One day the cops just roll into my classroom
and they haul me out of there.

154
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,344
And they did it right
in front of my kids too.

155
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,289
- Yeah. Totally.
- Molestation?

156
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,351
I mean, please!
I got so much ass back in those days.

157
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,022
What the hell did I need
that kind of shit for?

158
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:56,296
God, man, I hear you.
So much ass, it was like... Whew.

159
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,860
Oh, and you know what,
to tell you the truth?

160
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,873
I don't even remember who
these assholes are that are accusing me.

161
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,966
- Nothing special there, right?
- I guess.

162
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,207
Nothing special. You know, Coach, I've been
working out a lot since grammar school.

163
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,374
- Good for you, son.
- Yeah, it's good for you, right?

164
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,680
You know when you get real tight,
like, right up in here in this area here?

165
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,744
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

166
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,948
Not here. Like right in here.

167
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,120
What are you doing?

168
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,231
What do you want me to do?

169
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,701
All right. L... Okay.

170
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,236
- Oh!
- That's a good shot, bud.

171
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:42,303
Hey, tell me something, man.
What's been going on with you lately?

172
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,612
- You just seem...
- You know, um, I'm just distracted.

173
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:49,017
Is that why you ran out
of the bar the other day?

174
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:52,648
No. No. I was...
I had some stuff I needed to do.

175
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,215
- It just popped in my head.
- Yeah, well, that's understandable.

176
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,785
- We've all got things that we have to do.
- Yeah.

177
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,922
What you running from, Charlie?

178
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,590
What?

179
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,726
- Dee, could you grab me a beer?
- Grab one yourself.

180
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:06,168
- I'm right in the middle of a game.
- Your game isn't working.

181
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,605
- Let me play now.
- Let me play the game the way I want to play it.

182
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,166
<i>- Your way is dumb, and it's not working.
- Then we'll play your game.</i>

183
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,235
It's not gonna get the results we want.

184
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,645
You're playing a game for children,
and it's not working.

185
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:19,115
Charlie's not a baby. Charlie!

186
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:21,175
Great. Nice.
Good job, Dennis. Great.

187
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,813
How are you gonna put this on me?
You messed it up!

188
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,380
- You messed it up!
- We have to push him!

189
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,450
Push him? You're pushing him away.
Now he knows something's up.

190
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,894
- Good.
- Good?

191
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,989
Guys, I have good news!

192
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,432
I've been reading up
on the subject of pedophilia.

193
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,959
It turns out that it isn't about sex after all.
It's about power.

194
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,872
So, the assailant doesn't go after
the one he finds most attractive... this guy.

195
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,206
He goes after the weakest he can find.

196
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,576
Wow. That is good news.

197
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,582
- Jesus, Mac. What is wrong with you?
- No. You're not following.

198
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,676
If Murray was looking for the weakest
he could find, it wouldn't have been Charlie.

199
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,983
<i>- Why not?
- Because Charlie was a bit of a psychopath.</i>

200
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:59,888
When he got excited, his face would
turn purple and he'd start biting things.

201
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,051
I don't think Murray would've put
his dick anywhere near him.

202
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,823
- What about the McPoyle brothers?
- They were prime real estate.

203
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,559
- I'm sure he went to town on them.
- What's your point?

204
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,194
Charlie didn't get molested.

205
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,430
What?

206
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,772
- Good. I'm sure he didn't.
- Oh, boy.

207
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,778
- I'm sure he didn't.
- Yeah.

208
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,679
Leave this to the two people that are
qualified to deal with the situation.

209
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,377
It is cute that you did some research
and got four books though.

210
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,316
<i>- Nice work.
- Yeah, goodjob.</i>

211
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,049
You know what?
We tried it your little tippy-toe pussy way.

212
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,217
That failed miserably. So now why
don't we try something that will work?

213
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,729
Look, I just want to say that I think
this is a terrible approach.

214
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,321
You know how I already know that?
'Cause you keep saying it.

215
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,333
I keep saying it because... it is.

216
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,335
I'm sorry you're wrong
about stuff all the time.

217
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,462
- I'm sorry that you're sorry all the time.
- What?

218
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,472
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I don't care.

219
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,771
<i>- Well, hello, Dennis!
- Hi, Mrs. Kelly.</i>

220
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,936
Don't you look so handsome!

221
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,572
- And, Dee, so beautiful.
- Thank you, Mrs. Kelly.

222
00:11:56,648 --> 00:12:00,516
I'm sorry we had to stop by like this, but we
really need to talk to you about something.

223
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:04,681
- What?
- It's about Charlie.

224
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:11,729
Oh, I can't believe this!
I just can't believe it!

225
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,198
Though I have to admit,
it does explain a lot about him.

226
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,758
Yes, we were thinking the same thing.

227
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:21,738
Yes. Oh. Be strong, Bonnie.

228
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,436
Be strong
for your little gingerbread man.

229
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,536
Now is not the time for an episode.

230
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:35,151
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

231
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,383
So, what do you need from me?

232
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,641
Hello? Ma?

233
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,768
<i>In here, Charlie!</i>

234
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,337
Hey, I got your message.
You sounded kinda funny.

235
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,316
<i>- Come on back, honey.
- Is everything all right?</i>

236
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,250
Hello, Charlie.

237
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,257
Mom?

238
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:17,384
<i>Grandma? UncleJack?
What's... What's everybody doing here?</i>

239
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:20,795
<i>Well, we've all gathered here
at the request of your friends.</i>

240
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,198
- Hey, bud.
- Hi, Charlie.

241
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,237
Hello, Charles.

242
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:30,001
L... I don't exactly know how one
of these things are supposed to go.

243
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:34,341
<i>But we understand
that there's been some abuse.</i>

244
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,874
These two boys have been strong enough
to admit what happened...

245
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,943
and we thank you for that.

246
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,854
Just hope that that man goes away
for a long, long time.

247
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,586
Prison can be a bad place
for a guy like that.

248
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,026
Very bad place.

249
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:55,396
<i>Now, we're not exactly sure
how this thing is supposed to go.</i>

250
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,459
But your friends
have been helping us out...

251
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,505
on a couple of key points.

252
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:03,200
Now?

253
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,711
Okay, Charlie, show us on the doll.

254
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:15,686
Show you what?

255
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,246
- Where he touched you.
- Oh, yeah.

256
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,422
Shall I turn it over?

257
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,433
Yeah, turn her over.

258
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,944
Do it.

259
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,118
Slow. Slow.

260
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:16,280
- I think that went well.
- You did a wonderful job, Charlie.

261
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,839
<i>- I really think they bought it.
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.</i>

262
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:22,683
I gotta say, my favorite part was at the end
there when we were all hugging...

263
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,587
and my sister screamed and told everyone
that I touched her vagina.

264
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,557
Yeah!

265
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,223
So, Charlie...

266
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,596
where to?

267
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,659
Oh, well, I was thinking we should,
uh, zip down to the police station...

268
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,671
file an official report.

269
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,071
- I gotta do it sometime, right?
- That's the spirit.

270
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,132
Let's get it on the books.

271
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:54,049
Excuse me.
I'd like to, uh, speak to a detective, please.

272
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,553
- Name?
- Charlie Kelly.

273
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,851
And what is this in reference to?

274
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,858
Sodomy.

275
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,030
Okay. Uh, take a seat.
Someone will be right with you.

276
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,165
You're doing the right thing, Charlie.

277
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,727
The American school system's
been oppressing people for years.

278
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,797
It's about time we start doing
a little oppressing ourselves.

279
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,343
- That doesn't make sense.
- Yes, it does.

280
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:23,074
How are we oppressing anything?
You need to think before you speak.

281
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,083
<i>- You do.
- Charlie Kelly?</i>

282
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,746
Oh. That's me.
Uh, I'll be right back.

283
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,312
Have a good time.

284
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,554
Twenty-five million is a lot of clams.

285
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,529
- Split it 50-50.
- Charlie's gonna want something.

286
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,863
How 'bout Charlie?

287
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:45,402
Yeah. He'll want some.

288
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,461
He's not gonna get some.

289
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,564
We could always split it 50-50-50.

290
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,576
You even hear what you're saying?

291
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,038
Your gums are bleeding.

292
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,446
- How'd it go?
- Great. I just ratted you out.

293
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:01,007
Can I see you two boys
for a minute, please?

294
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,794
- So you're not gonna get in any trouble at all?
- Uh, no. No, not really.

295
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,891
And since the McPoyles are gonna plead guilty,
I'm off the hook completely.

296
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:20,563
- That's great.
- Sorry. Was he saying that the intervention worked?

297
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,437
- No, I don't think that's what he's saying.
- What are you talking about?

298
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,499
It was the final push Charlie needed.

299
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,512
Turns out three-quarters of a major...
not so bad after all.

300
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,276
And the best part of it, actually,
for me now is the fact...

301
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,579
that everybody thinks
that I've been molested.

302
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,052
So, in a way, my life is ruined.

303
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,613
In the meantime, I'm gonna go
in the back office and cry and cry and cry...

304
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,682
and drink for a while.

305
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,125
<i>Emotional release.</i>

306
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:50,258
- Another giant step forward.
- My God, we're good.

307
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,565
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

308
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,605
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,301
I mean, so I just want to apologize again
for the other day.

310
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,071
- It's all right, Mac. Don't worry about it.
- Awkward, right?

311
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,171
You know what? You were a good student
at school. You got potential.

312
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,876
- Just put that in your pocket.
- Really? You mean that?

313
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,283
- I mean that.
- Great, Coach. That's all I really needed to hear.

314
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,981
- Good.
- That is so great for me.

315
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,547
<i>- Hey, say hi to those folks for me.
- I will. Thanks.</i>

316
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,721
All right.
That little prick's goin' to hell.
