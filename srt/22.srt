1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,949
<i>That's a good shirt, Charlie, I like it.
You should buy that.</i>

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,863
- You like it?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,090
- Okay, stand a little to your left, please?
- Why?

4
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:10,289
- Dee, just, a little bit to your left.
- Why, Charlie?

5
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,093
So I can steal it.

6
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:14,188
No, you're not going to steal it,
just buy the shirt.

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,105
Dee, it's fine. It doesn't even have,
like, the exploding ink thing on it.

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,538
- We're good.
- Oh, great news.

9
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,495
I'm not getting arrested with you,
so buy it.

10
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,604
What is the point?

11
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:26,094
The point is that you have, like,
four articles of clothing,

12
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:28,480
and that's it for years and years
and years now, so buy something new.

13
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:31,546
All right, first of all,
this place is a rip-off, okay?

14
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:35,029
Secondly, someone should teach these people
how to do a decent hem, don't you think?

15
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,379
Oh, are you unsatisfied with that hem?

16
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:38,949
Very unsatisfied with the hem.

17
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,473
What do you know about hems, Charlie?

18
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:42,922
I've been sewing my clothes back together
for, like, almost my entire life.

19
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,762
I think I know a thing or
two about a hem, Dee, all right?

20
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:46,288
- Well, that's just sad.
- Well, it's not sad,

21
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,102
it's a very valuable skill set,
so, you know...

22
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:49,780
- Just try the shirt on and buy it.
- All right.

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,706
Shut up!

24
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,714
Shut up! Dee Reynolds?

25
00:00:58,065 --> 00:00:58,932
Yeah.

26
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:00,550
Ingrid...

27
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:03,265
Nelson from high school.

28
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,249
Ingrid Nelson?

29
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,339
Yeah.

30
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:10,332
You look so different.
What happened to all of the fat parts?

31
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:13,194
I lost them.
I lost a ton of weight.

32
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,932
And look at you, you look so beautiful.

33
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:21,676
You don't have that hideously ugly,
disgusting back brace anymore.

34
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:22,897
Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:26,621
God, we were such losers in high school.

36
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:28,414
Do you remember what
people used to call us?

37
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:32,120
- I don't remember.
- The Aluminum Monster and Fatty McGoo.

38
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:34,300
Yeah, that was it.

39
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:35,600
- Remember?
- Yeah.

40
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:36,816
- You were the Aluminum Monster.
- Yes.

41
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,823
- I was Fatty McGoo.
- Mm-hmm, yes.

42
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:42,312
Hey, do you remember how you used
to say that you were going

43
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:44,621
to be famous and have
your own clothing line?

44
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,487
- Did I say that?
- Oh, my God, every day.

45
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:50,035
Every day, it was famous actress
this and famous model that,

46
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:52,370
and all the kids did was laugh at you.

47
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,421
That is a good memory.

48
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,659
Well, no, I mean, it inspired me.

49
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:01,353
I thought to myself, "If the Aluminum
Monster can do it, then so can I."

50
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,452
- Oh.
- Dee, you're in my store!

51
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,581
- This is your store?
- Yes.

52
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,288
- All this, yours.
- Yeah, I know.

53
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,472
Hey, so, did you... ever do any...
are you a model now?

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,948
Are you... did you...?

55
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:20,811
Well, yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,944
- Yeah?
- Not, not... yeah.

57
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,651
Not right now, because I'm shopping.

58
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,030
- And did you go to law school?
- Oh, my God, I did.

59
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:30,245
- You did?
- Yeah, for a little while. I loved it.

60
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,542
- You must be so busy.
- I'm so busy.

61
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:36,936
So busy that I have to go, but
it was really excellent to see you.

62
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,961
Oh, it was so good to see you, too.

63
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,097
I would love to hang out...
Oh, congratulations. Hang out?

64
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,426
We're gonna hang out. We're gonna
do that. We're gonna do all of that.

65
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:44,530
Okay.

66
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,520
Charlie. You're not gonna believe this.

67
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,849
I just ran into the biggest loser from
my high school and she owns this store.

68
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,321
- Really?
- Yeah, I used to say all this stuff about,

69
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,853
you know, how I was going to be
big and famous to keep her down.

70
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,788
- Oh, yeah.
- But it just, it did the opposite.

71
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,941
It, like, inspired her or something,
which is terrible.

72
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,692
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.
Calm down, calm down.

73
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,838
Here's what you do, all right?

74
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,792
Pop on a couple things, slip them on,
we'll just walk right out of here.

75
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:10,640
No, no, that's not good enough.
I've got to beat her at her own game.

76
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,081
Charlie...

77
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:14,120
I got a fatty to take down.

78
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:20,390

00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,637
<i>Say, how's your design coming along?</i>

82
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,670
I can't believe you stole that shirt.

83
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,682
Oh, come on, I steal lots of things.

84
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,297
You don't have to get all huffy about
it. Let me take a look here.

85
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,063
- No, it's not ready for looking.
- Let me take

86
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:58,640
- a little look-see and then I'll, like...
- No!

87
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,597
Charlie, I'm not ready.

88
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,767
What are you guys working on over there?

89
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:05,372
Dee's designing a dress to put
her old nerd friend back in her place.

90
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,874
- Oh, which nerd friend?
- The fat one.

91
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,163
Ingrid Nelson.

92
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,908
Ingrid... oh, Fatty McGoo?

93
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:13,266
Oh, your old sidekick.
What's she been up to?

94
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:16,198
Well, she owns her own,
like, clothing store now, right.

95
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,486
So, Dee's making a dress.
I'm going to help her sew it,

96
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:21,374
because, according to Dee,
I'm a loser, too. Did you know this?

97
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,254
But, Sweet Dee, being a winner
is not something that you can become,

98
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:25,754
it's something that you're
kind of born with.

99
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,362
- Like me.
- Like us.

100
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:28,335
Like me.

101
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:30,055
- All right, let me take a look at this.
- No, hold on...

102
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,551
I feel like you're going to
make fun of it, it's not done.

103
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,162
It's not done yet.

104
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,589
When did... is this...

105
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,253
- Oh, no.
- What is... is it a boat?

106
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,683
- No, it's...
- It a boat with a triangle in it.

107
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,229
No, there's a cup and a straw.

108
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:42,808
- Oh, it's a...
- It's a cocktail dress.

109
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,674
- That's a strap.
- Is it a raincoat?

110
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:47,284
- It's not a raincoat!
- Oh, no, no, that a plug. It's a lightbulb.

111
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,249
- Oh, I see that.
- No, in my head, it's very... it's elegant.

112
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:52,997
I'm having a hard time putting it out
on paper what I'm seeing.

113
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:55,476
Through your hands? Because... have
your hands been smashed with hammers?

114
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,674
What is wrong with you?

115
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:58,673
So you're definitely not going to be
putting anybody in their place

116
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:00,148
- with a drawing like this.
- No. No.

117
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:01,839
Here, let me give it a shot here.

118
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,093
Yeah, Dennis, take a stab at it.

119
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,602
Okay, I'm going to
start with the breasts.

120
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,128
Naturally.
Come on.

121
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,546
- Right, okay.
- Oh, those are beautiful.

122
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,025
- Big, bountiful... I would say so.
- Gorgeous, right?

123
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:13,370
- Do you see?
- Yeah, that is some good...

124
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:16,147
Now we move on to the waist.
Delicate, precise.

125
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:19,648
Damn, dude, you can draw. I'm getting
kind of, like, a little flustered here.

126
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,289
Yeah, well, that's understandable.

127
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,598
- She's a nice-looking lady.
- Dude, I'll tell you what, dude.

128
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,059
How about I take this sketch, right,
and then I talk to Frank

129
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:28,991
about, you know, a really
good sewing machine.

130
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,799
- And then I whip up a prototype...
- Oh, of my designs?

131
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,111
- Yes.
- What? You dick.

132
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,098
Charlie, come on.
I thought we were a team.

133
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,774
Relax, I'm still going to help you make
your raincoat with the straw on it.

134
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:39,115
It's not a raincoat!

135
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,288
No one's going to buy... what is this?
This woman doesn't even have a ribcage.

136
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,924
It doesn't matter, Dee,
because winners always win.

137
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,181
You're not a winner, Dennis.

138
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:48,302
You're not a winner because you
used to be popular in high school,

139
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:49,602
but I think you peaked.

140
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:54,268
"Peaked"?

141
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:57,704
"Peaked," Dee?

142
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,985
Let me tell you something.
I haven't even begun to peak.

143
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,649
And when I do peak, you'll know.

144
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,050
Because I'm going to peak so hard,

145
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,206
that everybody in Philadelphia
is going to feel it.

146
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,855
I'm in my prime.

147
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:16,213
And I bet you that I could sell
these dresses to Fatty McGoo

148
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,134
just based on these sketches alone.

149
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:21,659
And your loser friend is going to
buy them because she's a fatty.

150
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:24,228
And that's just the way of the world.

151
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,990
All I have to do is turn on
my winning charm,

152
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:29,747
and Fatty McGoo will
be putty in my hands.

153
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,017
'Cause us winners always win.

154
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:34,097
He wasn't talking about you.

155
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:37,101
I think he was.

156
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,219
- It's too streaky.
- Where?

157
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,314
Everywhere! Fix it.

158
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:43,769
Well, I'm trying, Frank.

159
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,957
I've never spray painted
a chair before, okay?

160
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:46,928
Why are you covering your mouth?

161
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,614
Because that lead paint
is extremely toxic.

162
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,783
What? Is that why I'm feeling so dizzy?

163
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:57,670
Hey, all I'm hearing is excuses.
And I still have a blotchy chair.

164
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,271
Wait a second, wait a second.
What am I saying? What am I doing here?

165
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:03,498
You're making my chair look
like it was dipped in gold.

166
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:04,686
Now get back to work.

167
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,611
Nobody is stupid enough to think
that your chair was dipped in gold,

168
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,470
Frank, okay? Why am I helping you?

169
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,104
Because I'm manipulating you.

170
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:14,126
That's the way I get people
to do things for me.

171
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,816
- Really?
- Yeah.

172
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,534
Shit, that's awesome.
How did you do that?

173
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,645
If you make my chair look
really nice, I will tell you.

174
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:22,993
Deal.

175
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,735
- I got it.
- A drink, yes, good, good, good.

176
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:28,212
Excellent, listen, man. I need to use
your business connections

177
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:30,383
to see if I can get like
a really cheap sewing machine.

178
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:31,904
Why?

179
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,453
Well, 'cause Dennis and I are gonna
make a dress, see if we can sell it.

180
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:36,120
You're gonna go in the garment business?

181
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,584
No, dude. I'm not going into
the garment business, okay?

182
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,693
I'm just gonna make one
single dress with Dennis.

183
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:41,937
Who's gonna run the operation?

184
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:43,204
It's not an operation, dude.

185
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,968
Look, I just want your help
getting a sewing machine.

186
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,348
Whoa. Wait.

187
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:50,127
Has that chair been dipped in gold?

188
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,688
So we would cinch it up nice and
tight through the waist, giving

189
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,777
a nice subtle lift to the top of
the dress and keeping those

190
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,076
fat tummies in check. Gorgeous.

191
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:01,710
- Okay, Dennis, I'm confused.
- Why's that?

192
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:05,845
These are just pictures of
women with giant breasts.

193
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,160
Yeah.

194
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:11,078
And, in some of these sketches,
the women aren't even wearing clothes.

195
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,312
Yes.

196
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,334
Well... why?

197
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,337
Listen, let me level with you.

198
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,477
You're an attractive enough girl.
I mean, certainly you've got some

199
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:21,472
potential, all right?

200
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,785
There's no reason for you
to be so nervous around me.

201
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,907
Why don't you just order a
couple of my dresses and...

202
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:31,483
maybe, if you're lucky, I'll even
make one special just for you.

203
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,512
And if you look good enough in it, hell,

204
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:36,020
I might even consider
having sex with you.

205
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,476
How does that sound?

206
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:38,687
Terrible.

207
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,024
All right. Let's just calm down.

208
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,052
You're, you're having a reaction,
that's understandable.

209
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,401
It's the nerd in you talking.
Why don't we start over?

210
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,608
How many of my dresses
would you like to order?

211
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,364
None. Not one.

212
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:51,670
Okay, well.

213
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,556
I'm not gonna take "no"
for an answer, because I,

214
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,457
I just refuse to do that,
because I'm a winner.

215
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:58,426
And winners, we don't listen
to words like "no", or

216
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,369
or "don't" or "stop!". Those words
are just not in our vocabulary.

217
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,153
I know what you need.

218
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,885
You need to see my
dress on a model.

219
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,425
I'll tell you what.

220
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,613
I'm gonna come back tomorrow...

221
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,419
- with a model.
- Please don't do that.

222
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,366
Save your breath, Ingrid.
Those words have never worked on me.

223
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,728
I'll see you tomorrow.

224
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:26,561
Look, I'm so confused.

225
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,031
Why does she have light bulbs
growing out of her neck?

226
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,502
Light bulbs? What?
Those are shoulder pads.

227
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:32,868
- What?
- Yeah!

228
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:34,653
Nah, you know what?
I'll walk you through it.

229
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,940
No. I don't even wanna...

230
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,157
Look, why don't you just help
me make Dennis' designs?

231
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,854
Because Dennis' designs are terrible.

232
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,711
- I enjoy them.
- I know you do, Charlie.

233
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,918
I walked in and saw you enjoying
them very much this morning.

234
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,679
Oh, this again. This again... I told
you I was scratching myself, Dee!

235
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,783
You were scratching hard
and very vigorously, so...

236
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:50,123
No, that's 'cause that's
the only way I can...

237
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:52,125
Oh, boy. It must have really itched.

238
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,633
All right, all right, fine.
What... What is this thing?

239
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,787
That's Dennis's prototype.

240
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,235
- Be careful with that.
- No, I know it's the prototype,

241
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,956
- but I don't get how it works.
- Dee!

242
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,349
You're asking a million
questions! All right, look, look,

243
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,267
okay, I'm just gonna walk
you through it, all right?

244
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:04,360
- Yes, thank you.
- So pay attention.

245
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,396
Okay, look, the pretty lady
gets naked, of course,

246
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,405
and I help her into
the prototype, yes?

247
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:13,025
Uh, my hands sort of guiding along her
body, making sure that it fits properly.

248
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,676
Now the dress is starting to
look fantastic, you know, and

249
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,132
and she feels very excited.

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,036
She feels very sensual and I
feel very sensual about her

251
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,609
because she looks so good.

252
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:24,006
And then, you know, we chitchat
a little bit, no big deal,

253
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,117
but she asks me back to her place.
Where did that come from?

254
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,880
I accept, you know, and then,
you know, we chitchat at her place.

255
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,086
It's no big deal, but
eventually, she says, you know,

256
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:33,219
"Do you wanna make love, Charlie?"

257
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:34,951
- Oh, God.
- And I say, "Are you serious?

258
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,610
Because yes, I do".
And, and, and then just "boom"...

259
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:39,718
we're into it and it's
hot and it's passionate,

260
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,188
- and then...
- Charlie.

261
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,296
And then it's just
me and you babe,

262
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,106
- like, all night long.
- Oh, my God.

263
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:43,806
- And I satisfy her so many times,
- Charlie.

264
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,431
- she starts screaming my name...
- Charlie.

265
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:46,848
- "Charlie," she says...
- Charlie!

266
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,069
"Charlie," she says,
"Charlie", she says...

267
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:51,311
Charlie! Jesus!

268
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,578
Dee!

269
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,625
What are you... I thought
you had walked back over...

270
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:57,875
- No, I've been standing here the whole time.
- Look, I was in the middle of a...

271
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:01,062
- Are you gonna help me with this or not?
- I'm trying to...

272
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,149
What are you doing?
'Cause you're looking pretty...

273
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:04,511
- All right...
- Oh, Jesus, I'm gonna do it myself.

274
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,074
I gotta say, Frank, I'm really
happy about this partition.

275
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,589
I can't tell you how many
memories this brings back.

276
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,113
- Yeah?
- This is exactly the way

277
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:13,425
I ran my sweatshops.

278
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,381
- Is it?
- Yes.

279
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:18,398
- You have to separate them from us.
- Right.

280
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:21,015
- They need to be trained.
- Right, okay.

281
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,623
- Yeah, I got an idea. I got an idea, okay?
- Trained.

282
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,391
- I wanna play music in there.
- Yeah?

283
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:27,330
'Cause I think it'll keep them
happy and motivated and

284
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,540
- and they'll work harder.
- No, no, no, no, no, Mac.

285
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:31,059
You gotta break them.

286
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,630
- You gotta break them like dogs.
- Break them.

287
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:36,276
- Yeah.
- Break them like dogs.

288
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,776
You, you wanna learn
about manipulation?

289
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,732
- Yes, yes.
- All right, this is it, all right, here.

290
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:45,137
First rule of manipulation is
you gotta show them who is boss.

291
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:49,803
You gotta rant! And
rave and yell at people!

292
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:54,025
Then... they find
their place. That's it.

293
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,546
Everyone, gather around. I
have an announcement to make.

294
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,210
Dennis has an announcement. Go.

295
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,390
- Now's your chance. Rant and rave.
- Now, now's my chance.

296
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:03,237
Gather around, everybody.
Everybody, gather around, please!

297
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:04,389
We're all standing here.

298
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,201
- Is this everybody?
- Is this everybody?

299
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,474
You know it's everybody.
What are you doing?

300
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:08,508
Dennis has an announcement.

301
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,504
Yeah, I-I heard that.
I'm wondering what it is.

302
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,101
- It's an announcement.
- What's up, Dennis?

303
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:13,128
I have an announcement.

304
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,467
- Oh, my God, what is it?
- Quiet on the floor, please. Dennis...

305
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:18,003
- your announcement.
- Thank you.

306
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:22,852
I think everyone will be pleased to learn
that we have just received our first order.

307
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,646
That's amazing! I can't believe they placed
an order before they saw the prototype.

308
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,543
Well, believe it, Charlie,
'cause that's what just happened.

309
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:30,681
What the hell did Fatty Magoo
like about your sketches?

310
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,617
Shut up! How many did they order?

311
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,550
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five?

312
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:37,211
25 dresses, that's right.
Charlie, do you have my prototype?

313
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,502
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey,
hey, hey, any more of those sketches?

314
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:43,124
You know, maybe like one where, like,
the lady's, like, looking right at you.

315
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,374
Stop talking to me.

316
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,008
All right, everyone, I want those dresses.
Now, I don't care how you do it...

317
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,401
just make it work.

318
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:52,698
- You heard the man, make it work!
- You heard our designer.

319
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,365
Ladies and gentlemen, back to
your stations, let's make it work!

320
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,891
No. No, I'm not going to make it
work. I'm designing my own clothes.

321
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,784
I'm supposed to be the one
who's beating Fatty Magoo.

322
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:05,546
- Mac, take care of this.
- Okay. Dee, can I talk to you for a second?

323
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,243
Look, I know what you're trying to do,
you wanna show this girl what's what.

324
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,898
I get that and I think if you just
buckle down and join the team...

325
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,454
Mac, I'm gonna stop you right there.

326
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:17,505
First of all, your breath smells like an
old lady fart passing through an onion.

327
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:21,096
Secondly, I know you're trying to
manipulate me, and it's not going to work.

328
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:24,545
Get your hand off my shoulder,
because I've got a fatty to burn.

329
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,586
She's gonna be here any minute.

330
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,371
Can we get this thing tighter? Can
we lift these up a little bit? My God!

331
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:34,879
Are you sure this is the right size?

332
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,149
The dress is the right size; I wish I
could say the same thing about your body.

333
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,669
I mean, my God, what, did you eat
the entire kitchen cupboard today?

334
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,417
- What's wrong with my body?
- So many things! I mean, your breasts,

335
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,478
- they're like tiny, your gut is huge.
- I wear a D cup!

336
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:47,773
Well, you're just lying about that. All
right, um, take this gut and suck it in.

337
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:51,048
- What gut?
- Suck the gut in before I scream.

338
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:52,729
How did you get into my office?

339
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:57,022
Ah, well, how does anyone get in anywhere,
Ingrid? A little hard work and persistence.

340
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:58,816
Did you kick in my door?

341
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,286
I intend to kick down a
lot of doors today, Ingrid.

342
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,838
Now, you're gonna have to use
your imagination a little bit

343
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,971
because my model is a
little on the... side.

344
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,747
- But tell me what you see.
- Well, I see a man

345
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,631
committing a felony by breaking into
my office and destroying my property.

346
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,852
I also see a very confused and
uncomfortable model, who seems to be stuffed

347
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,532
into an ill-fitting garbage bag.

348
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:23,317
Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm...
I see what you're saying, yes.

349
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,046
You're saying that you love the
dress, but you hate this model.

350
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,383
- She hates the dress, you freak.
- Silence your mouth!

351
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:34,018
She cannot properly see the dress
because your disgusting body's ruining it.

352
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:38,175
- I can't believe I let you see me naked.
- Well, that was... part of the...

353
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,240
All right, I'm calling the police.

354
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,733
No. No, no. Ingrid, there's no
need to call the police, okay?

355
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:46,586
Because the only crime that's being
committed today... is the crime of ugliness.

356
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:49,021
And, sadly, you can't
press charges for that.

357
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,788
You know what? I'm just gonna have
to come back next time with a model...

358
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,407
with a perfect body.

359
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:56,636
You've been a disappointment.
Shame on you.

360
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:05,572
No, no, no. Shit. Hold on a second.

361
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:11,480
Look at this. Beyond our wildest dreams.
Everything working out, huh, Mac?

362
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,803
- This is brilliant, Frank.
- It's going smooth.

363
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:14,882
How you doing with Charlie?

364
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:16,956
- Did you break him like a dog yet?
- Almost.

365
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:21,596
I've changed his diet to only dry food and he
is no longer allowed on any of the furniture.

366
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,739
Good. What about Deandra?

367
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:27,730
Oh... Not so good. She's
still causing problems.

368
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:30,249
You're gonna have to take
care of this right away.

369
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:35,130
- Oh, goddamn it. Come on, just go straight.
- Dee. Dee! Dee, come on!

370
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,210
I feel like it's
broken or something.

371
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:37,833
It's not broken. You're
just messing with it.

372
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:40,058
- I'm not messing with it. I'm just trying...
- You're punching in and...

373
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,829
- Don't stomp on the pedal like that, Dee!
- How do these people...?

374
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,425
- Who are these women?
- They're Eastern European women.

375
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:47,847
I have no idea where Frank got
them, but they are very good sewers.

376
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:49,744
- You should ask them how to sew. Okay?
- They smell like sausage.

377
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:50,746
They do smell like sausage, though.

378
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:51,958
- It's terrible. That's what it is!
- Right?

379
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,385
Charlie, shh!

380
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,211
- Dee, I need a word.
- Get out of here.

381
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,274
- What are you working on?
- It's my dress, you know that.

382
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:02,070
Did we not have a conversation
about this, Deandra?

383
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,993
- The dress does not fit the prototype.
- I don't give a shit.

384
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,898
- Come on, Dee, don't rock the boat here.
- Shh! Charlie, I can handle this.

385
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:09,246
No, I'm on your side here, man...

386
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,300
- I'm just trying to say...
- Charlie, sit.

387
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,796
- Don't tell me to sit, dude.
- You want a treat?

388
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,792
I think I got some jerky here in my...
Oh! I do have some jerky in my pocket.

389
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,706
- You want some? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,877
- You sure you want some?
- Yeah.

391
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,041
- Wait for it. Sit.
- Yeah.

392
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,800
Shake. Speak.

393
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:26,288
Uh, I would like some jerky, please.

394
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,225
Good boy.

395
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:29,533
Ha-ha! He caught it.
He catches it every time.

396
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,125
Hey, hey, hey, you want
a piece of jerky?

397
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:33,912
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

398
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,917
You're supposed to be a
goddamn modeling agency

399
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:42,105
and this is the best you've got?

400
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:44,953
I mean, I... I ask you to send me
models who are attractive...

401
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:47,762
pictures of girls that have bodies like
Oompa Loompas and hippopotamuses...

402
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:50,230
I can't talk to you people.
I can't... Mmm, mmm, mmm!

403
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,162
How hard is it to find an attractive model
in the city of Philadelphia, I mean...

404
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,256
Hey-oh!

405
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,860
Guess what, buddy! We did it!

406
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,736
- We filled the order!
- What order?

407
00:16:57,786 --> 00:17:00,679
The dresses, dude... 25.
Pretty efficient, huh?

408
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:05,779
Yeah. Just, uh, put them...
put them by the door or something.

409
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,440
Okay. Hey!

410
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,153
You want me to help you
bring them to the store?

411
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,271
No!

412
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,011
No. I don't want you to ever
go to the store... ever!

413
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,573
Why not? Something wrong?

414
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:17,150
No. E... Everything's great.
Everything's...

415
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:18,912
perfect.

416
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,484
Then why don't you want
me to go to the store?

417
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:24,923
'Cause you're busy.

418
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,903
I'm not busy.
I actually have a pretty...

419
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,227
clear docket for the next couple of...

420
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:31,009
No, you're so busy 'cause
uh, we just got another order.

421
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,982
We did? For how many?

422
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:36,892
A hundred.

423
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,627
A hundred?

424
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,450
We got an order for a hundred dresses?

425
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,716
Oh, my God, that's fantastic!

426
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,274
We gotta kick it up a notch.

427
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,265
Dee, come here.
Where the hell have you been?

428
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,796
It's only 9:00 in the morning.

429
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh, my God, I've been here since 5:00.

430
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:09,108
- What?
- Dee, things have changed around here.

431
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,758
They're running this place
like a concentration camp.

432
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,444
I mean, we shouldn't even
be talking right now.

433
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,074
I think you gotta sit down
and get to work, Dee.

434
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,007
It's bad, the situation is bad.

435
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:17,115
Oh, my God.

436
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,401
They're watching us, Dee.

437
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,764
They're always watching us.

438
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,781
What do you think they're
saying out there, Frank?

439
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,917
I don't know, but I don't like it.

440
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:29,182
The German war propaganda
was a nice idea.

441
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,022
Wait till you hear the steam whistle.

442
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,489
Charlie, where's my dress?

443
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:37,162
Charlie!

444
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,055
I left it right here. Where is it?

445
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,199
- Look, this...
- Did you do something with my dress?

446
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,213
- What did you do? Where is it?
- Just go back to work, all right?

447
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,649
Tell me, you son of a bitch.

448
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:45,912
I'm not supposed to say!

449
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,397
Is that a steam whistle?

450
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,050
What the hell's going on over there?

451
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:00,646
Everything's fine.

452
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:02,029
What happened to my dress?

453
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,170
It was destroyed and the
materials were distributed

454
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,844
- amongst the workers.
- What?

455
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,641
You guys, how could
you do that to me?

456
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:10,243
I worked forever on that dress.

457
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:14,074
- The dress did not fit the prototype.
- It didn't fit the prototype, Dee.

458
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,527
Screw the prototype!
What are you talking about?

459
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,008
Now I have to start all over.

460
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,435
I'm afraid not, Deandra.

461
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,233
We're gonna have to let her go.

462
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,109
- You heard the man, Dee. Get off the floor!
- Oh, my God.

463
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:25,452
- Off the floor now, Dee!
- You know what?

464
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:28,186
- Dee, off the floor!
- Ladies!

465
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:31,220
We're outta here! We don't
need this! Let's go!

466
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,785
- Got a whole box of knockwurst up there.
- Deandra.

467
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:35,275
- A big pot of it.
- Deandra.

468
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:36,837
- Why do they listen to her, Frank?
- What are you doing?

469
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,108
I'm staging a strike. Let's go!

470
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,593
I'm pulling it again!
I'm pulling it again!

471
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:43,020
- Back to work! Back to work!
- Keep going! Keep going!

472
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,698
You can do it, Dennis,
because you're a winner.

473
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,779
You haven't peaked.

474
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,848
You haven't even begun to peak,
but you're gonna peak today.

475
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,387
Oh, you're gonna peak
all over everybody.

476
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:00,201
Make it work, Dennis.

477
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:10,349
Make it work.

478
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:15,678
There she is.

479
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:17,291
Dee, what are you doing?

480
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,673
I'm having you arrested for slave labor.

481
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:20,760
- Slave labor?
- Yes.

482
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,962
What the hell are you talking about?

483
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:23,838
You bought some dresses
from my brother, Dennis,

484
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:27,287
that were made in a sweatshop
in the basement of our bar.

485
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,033
Do not listen to a word this woman says.
She is stark, raving mad.

486
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:33,652
She's a goddamn lunatic, okay?

487
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,771
Those dresses were made
by voluntary laborers

488
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:38,510
who work for us
on their own free will

489
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,782
to feed their starving families
in their home countries.

490
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,277
- In a sweatshop.
- No. Not a sweatshop.

491
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,662
- It is a sweatshop, which makes you
- A working factory.

492
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,805
the biggest loser, Fatty McGoo.

493
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:51,054
I didn't buy anything
from your insane brother.

494
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,364
- Really?
- What?

495
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,534
- Really.
- So, let me get this straight.

496
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,399
Dennis has been lying
to us the whole time?

497
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,357
I don't know and I don't care.

498
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,516
Wait a second... Fatty McGoo.

499
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,121
Are you Ingrid Nelson?

500
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:07,738
- Yes.
- No shit! I'm Mark Dunlap.

501
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,266
I knew you in high school.
Wow. You look terrific.

502
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:13,501
Thanks.

503
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:18,878
And that would make you the
Aluminum Monster... oh, man!

504
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,057
- You were all jacketed up, huh?
- I don't remember.

505
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,732
Remember that? With the back brace...

506
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:25,707
and all that metal... I mean,
you were like... you were like...

507
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,765
an aluminum monster.
That really was the best name for it.

508
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,004
The only name for it, really.

509
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,369
- You were so cute.
- Awww... thanks.

510
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,764
It was a lot of metal, man. Hey, hey,

511
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:36,184
I used to know your brother.

512
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:38,301
Now, he was a pretty cool guy.
Whatever happened to him?

513
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,977
Behold a winner in all his...

514
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:44,541
Holy shit.

515
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,909
What are you guys doing here?
