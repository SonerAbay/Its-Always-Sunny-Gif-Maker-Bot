1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:03,846
Dee's bringing another boyfriend?

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,253
She won't shut up about this
one. He's a local rapper.

3
00:00:06,324 --> 00:00:08,451
He's like some hotshot
rapper. What's his name?

4
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:11,757
Lil' Jeff. Lil' Joe. It's was,
like, Jonathan, Little Michael.

5
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,319
Lil' Kev?
Little... Lil' Kev.

6
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:15,332
Shit. I've heard about
him. He's a local celebrity.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,334
He's supposed to be the
next Eminem. What is he?

8
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:19,336
Like a small guy or little
guy? No, probably not.

9
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:22,134
I think it's just a rapper thing.
Lil' Kim. Yeah, it's like...

10
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:26,472
You never know though. He could have, like,
a little hand or a little foot or something.

11
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,739
I doubt he'd want to call attention
to that by calling himself Lil' Kev.

12
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:30,974
That could be his thing.
Biggie Smalls was fat.

13
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,643
Yeah. He was big and small.
You know, and, like... Right.

14
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:35,948
I guess his head was
small, but his body was big.

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,614
So this guy could have, like,
a little hand and a giant body.

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,022
What's up, hos? I'd like
you to meet somebody.

17
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:43,322
Kevin, these are the clowns I work with.

18
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,555
Oh, this your crew, baby?
Mm-hmm.

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,963
Girl, you silly. They ain't
no clowns. What up, fellas?

20
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,831
What's up, man? Hey,
man. How's it going?

21
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,066
I gots to get back to the studio, but
I'll holler at you later, okay, pooh bear?

22
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,403
Mm-hmm.
Yo, later, fellas.

23
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,409
See ya, man.
Yeah.

24
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,503
Boom. Yep, you're seein' it.

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,811
Hey, Dee, does that guy have,
like, a... like, a little hand?

26
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,408
Charlie, I was gonna
say his foot looks small.

27
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,078
Nah. Well, dude, it's possible.

28
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,588
The shoes were the same
size, but his hand was like...

29
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:14,591
He doesn't have a little
hand or a little foot.

30
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,786
Wait. Did that guy go
to Waldron? I don't know.

31
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,419
Is his name Kevin Gallagher?
Yes.

32
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,465
Holy shit. No, that guy's
retarded. Well, you're retarded.

33
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:24,365
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm
saying he is an actual retarded person.

34
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,027
We went to elementary school together.

35
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:29,130
He used to take classes in a trailer
outside school. He rode the short bus.

36
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:32,540
Whatever. You think I wouldn't know
if the guy I'm dating is retarded?

37
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:39,546
There is no way I am
dating a retarded person.

38
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,980
But he's so tough and
popular and famous.

39
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,988
I mean, he's a successful musician.

40
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,548
Jesus, sweetie. The
guy might be retarded.

41
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:26,028
Yeah, but he might not be.
Plus, he gives me things.

42
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:28,497
Did you guys see this necklace?
It's got diamonds in it.

43
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,500
L I gotta think about this.

44
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,763
Come take a look at my elementary
school yearbook sometime, Dee.

45
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:35,067
He's retarded. Uh, guys,
I'm getting an idea.

46
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,733
Charlie, follow me on this
one for a second. Okay.

47
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,505
Retarded or not... I mean, clearly
there's something off about that guy.

48
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,512
Oh, no. That guy's very messed up.

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,344
Yeah. No, he's... I'm saying
he's retarded. Yeah, whatever.

50
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,407
But he's an up-and-coming
musician. I mean, he's, like...

51
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:49,419
really building a
following in this city.

52
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,819
He's like the next Eminem.
Right. He's supposed to be big.

53
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:55,381
Okay. So, if he can do it,
why can't we?

54
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,362
I can't argue that logic, man. What are you
suggesting? I'm thinking we start a band.

55
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,364
Holy shit. Yeah!

56
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,229
Yeah?

57
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:05,235
We're in a band!
Yeah! Let's do it!

58
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:08,101
I've always wanted to be a rock god.
If he's getting chicks... Ooh! Ooh, ooh.

59
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:11,073
Why are you "ooh, oohing" me?
Why are you... You're not in it.

60
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,133
Why am I not in it?
I have a great voice.

61
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,304
You do have a great voice.
You have an excellent voice.

62
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,177
But the problem is you're into all
that early '80s glam rock fem shit...

63
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:21,116
and it's just not the artistic
direction I want to take the band in.

64
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:23,085
Artistic direction? You guys
don't even play instruments.

65
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,088
Well, no... Okay, well,
that doesn't matter, does it?

66
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:27,556
Because it's all about rocking
and looking cool and kicking ass.

67
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,855
Yeah, I think he's right. It's
all about image and marketing.

68
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:33,055
I mean, there's no bands out
there with any musical ability.

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,257
Frank, I like the way you
think. You're in the band.

70
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,131
Oh!

71
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,329
Wow. Dude, don't overreact
about it, man. See you, buddy.

72
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:44,067
Frank, get out that checkbook.
You're gonna buy us some instruments.

73
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:47,177
Yeah, brother.
That's a hot guitar.

74
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:50,908
You got, uh, graphite reinforced
neck, 35 inch scale, two humbuckers.

75
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:53,109
Yeah, guy, move over six inches.

76
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,118
Oh, yeah.

77
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:57,984
Um, yeah, so I was saying...
Yeah, that's it. Shut up.

78
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:59,955
Soak it in.

79
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,255
Uh, so I was saying, uh, graphite
reinforced neck... Boom. Yeah.

80
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:07,058
35 inch scale...
Shh. That's the one.

81
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:20,370
Check this thing out, man.
It's like a weapon. Cool, bro.

82
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:23,140
Holy shit. Where did you
learn how to play like that?

83
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:27,150
Oh, man, keyboards just make sense
to me, man. I get 'em, you know?

84
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:30,381
Charlie, you're amazing. Hey, man,
you're gonna be our ace in the hole.

85
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,979
You know what though? Can I talk
to you for a second about this?

86
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:35,525
Sure. Any way that I can be
in the back of the stage...

87
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:38,460
or, like, behind some
kind of curtain? Why?

88
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,396
Well, can I bare my soul to you
for a second, man? Of course, buddy.

89
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,127
This is huge for me. I've
always wanted to do this. Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,567
It's, like, this is a big deal.
I've just always been afraid...

91
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,867
that people are gonna boo
me or they're gonna hate me.

92
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,842
It's why I've never pursued my dreams,
man. So, I mean, if that happens...

93
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,811
it's gonna crush me, I'm gonna crumble,
I'm gonna fall to pieces, I'm gonna scream.

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,814
You're not listening to what
I'm saying, are you? Totally.

95
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,476
Dude, I think we should do,
like, a Sex Pistols thing, right?

96
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,485
Where I'm Sid Vicious
and you're Johnny Rotten.

97
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:06,421
No, no. I'm Simon and you're Garfunkel,
if anything. No. You're Axl. I'm Slash.

98
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,891
No. I'm Holland Oates.
You're, like, Peter Gabriel.

99
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,826
Hall and Oates is
two separate people.

100
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,889
No. Holland is his first name
and Oates is his last name, dude.

101
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,901
Whatever, dude.
I just wanna kick ass.

102
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,699
Hey. You with that bald guy?
Yeah.

103
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,239
Yeah, well, get him out of
here, or I'm calling the cops.

104
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,613
I'm taking these.

105
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:41,088
There he is. Good old Special
K. He is drooling on himself.

106
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:43,353
Well, so what? He's, like,
seven in this yearbook.

107
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,895
Okay, if I'm gonna break up
with this guy, I need some proof.

108
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:48,193
Well, look, Dee, you're free
to date whoever you want, okay?

109
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,530
I just think you should know whether or
not you're gold-digging a retarded guy.

110
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,003
Okay, number one, I'm not gold-digging
anybody, okay? I really like this guy.

111
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:57,597
And second of all, this doesn't prove
that he's retarded. You want proof?

112
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,609
I want proof. When are
you seeing him next?

113
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:02,475
I'm picking him up in, like,
an hour. You're picking him up?

114
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:04,878
He doesn't drive. Ooh.
Uh, that's funny...

115
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,110
'cause people who
aren't retarded usually drive.

116
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:09,414
Retarded one.
Normal zero.

117
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,921
Not bad, Dennis. Nice neighborhood.
Owns his own house. Three stories.

118
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:20,862
Looks like it's
retarded one, normal one.

119
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,799
Yes? Oh, hi. I think we
have the wrong address.

120
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,996
Are you Dee?
Yeah. Who are you?

121
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,471
I'm Kevin's mom.
Come on in.

122
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,499
Oh, lives with his mom. I think
I'll be taking that point back.

123
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:36,171
Kevin's in his room.
Go on up if you like.

124
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,774
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Gallagher. You
must be very, very proud of your son.

125
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,684
I mean, he has overcome some
pretty difficult odds. Yes, he has.

126
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,415
Well, you're talking about
the rapping. Excuse me?

127
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,514
Those odds you're referring to, you're
talking about his rapping career.

128
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,115
I guess.
Mrs. Gallagher...

129
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:51,661
would you describe your
son as a "special" guy?

130
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,856
No, you can't do that. Why
can't I do that? What's wrong...

131
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,865
Because he's her son.
Of course he's special.

132
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,299
That's an easy yes. You think
he's special, right? Well, yes.

133
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,861
Yeah, that means nothing to me. That means
a whole lot. Retarded three, normal zero.

134
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,539
Hold on. Hang on. How come you
got that point? That was my point.

135
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,547
What... That was my point.
Retarded two, normal one.

136
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,743
She practically came out and told us he
was retarded. Retarded four, normal zero.

137
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,016
Whoa! Hold on a second. Where'd four
come from? It's definitely not four.

138
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,023
Let's see. There's the driving,
the drooling in the yearbook...

139
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,685
the overcoming the odds, the living
with the mom and now the special thing.

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,625
You know what? It's not
four. It's five. Yeah?

141
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,994
Are you the point king? You pick up points
left and right? It's retarded three, normal one.

142
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,090
Oh, come on. There's so much
more retarded stuff that...

143
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,137
What's up?

144
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,174
Hey!
Oh, you brought your crew, baby.

145
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,074
This is my brother, Dennis,
and he's gonna give us a ride.

146
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,044
Oh, snap! What up, son?
Hey.

147
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,740
I didn't know we were doing all that.

148
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:46,214
Yo, I gotta grab a couple of
things. Be ready to "rizzoll."

149
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,685
Man, that's retard strength if I've
ever seen it. You know what I mean?

150
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:54,020
Shut your mouth.

151
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,654
Go!

152
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,064
Go! Go!

153
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:07,002
All right, stop! Stop!
Why are you not singing?

154
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:10,438
Well, uh, it doesn't sound very good.

155
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:13,375
Well, then huff some glue, bro.
Oh, I've been huffing glue, guys.

156
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,275
Then growl into the microphone,
Charlie. No. This is...

157
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:17,280
I don't even wanna growl.
I'm not a growler. Wait.

158
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,545
Band meeting! Band meeting! Yeah, band
meeting! We need to have a band meeting!

159
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:26,056
Hold on a minute! We're sittin' around
here practicin' like a bunch of pansies!

160
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:29,286
We should be out gettin'
wasted and breakin' shit!

161
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,557
Frank's absolutely right. How can we be rock
stars if we're not living like rock stars?

162
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,326
Well, okay. If we live like
rock stars, the music will come!

163
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,424
Okay. Okay. Okay. The
music will come, Charlie!

164
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,435
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Stop, dude!

165
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:42,870
What are you doing? That's my
good chair. That's your good chair?

166
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,408
Yeah.
It's covered in bird shit.

167
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:48,377
No.
That's toothpaste, man.

168
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,710
That's clearly bird shit.
No, it's not. It's toothpaste.

169
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,716
Do you even own a toothbrush?
I, uh...

170
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,314
Look, don't break my chair.
Oh, my God!

171
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,086
No! Wait, wait, wait. Wait
a minute. Charlie is right.

172
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,753
We should not be breaking
our own shit.

173
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:09,562
We should be out there breaking other
people's shit. That's rock and roll.

174
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,692
Yeah!

175
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,136
That's what I'm talking about!
You feeling better, Charlie? Whoo!

176
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,969
Yeah! Whoo!

177
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,239
Keep smashing things,
guys! It's a ripple effect!

178
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:24,804
Hey, how'd you guys get a hotel room
without putting a credit card down?

179
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,476
We did use a credit card, man.
I took it out of your wallet.

180
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

181
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:33,023
My credit card number's
down at the desk? Yeah.

182
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,651
You mean we're smashing up a hotel room
with my credit card down at the desk!

183
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,661
Why-Why-Why would you do that?

184
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:41,960
Uh, they don't let you book a hotel room
without putting down a credit card, Frank.

185
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,830
What year do you think it is?

186
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:46,995
Well, we gotta put this stuff
back together again. What?

187
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,507
Get the glue. Charlie, you gotta get the
glue. What? Glue is for huffing, dude.

188
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:53,634
Get me the glue! Get me the
glue! It's a part of his process.

189
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:56,839
This is not rock and roll!

190
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,715
Oh, this shit is funny!
You like this movie?

191
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,785
Your shirt's on backwards.
What?

192
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,990
Oh, snap! It is.

193
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,659
Oh, look!

194
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,652
We need to break up.

195
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:50,079
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

196
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:53,125
Hey. Where's your suit?

197
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:56,559
I'm not wearing the suit, Frank, because
it's lame, and you look like a pussy.

198
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:00,531
That-That defeats the whole purpose. I
mean, the idea is to trick the moms...

199
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,932
into letting the kids bop with us.

200
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:05,800
It's not the '50s anymore, Frank.
The kids aren't bopping anymore.

201
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,568
They're banging each other and doing
meth before they hit grade school.

202
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:11,769
Well, can I at least pick the
name of the band? What do you got?

203
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:15,336
The Pecan Sandies.

204
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:18,907
Isn't that a cookie? Yeah, it's a
cookie, but it's got another meaning.

205
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,612
What's the other meaning?
What?

206
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,746
Other than a cookie,
what's the other meaning?

207
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:25,620
It's a, you know... It's
a... It's a sexual meaning.

208
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,422
No, we are not the Pecan Sandies,
all right? We are Chemical Toilet.

209
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:32,055
Because chicks want guys that wear tight
pants and tattered clothing and spit blood...

210
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:34,998
not guys dressed like waiters who
name themselves after desserts.

211
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,730
We are Chemical Toilet.
Charlie! Porta-potty.

212
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:40,796
Hey, how's that song coming? Yeah,
I'll be out in a second, all right?

213
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:43,171
And, Frank, who the hell is this guy?

214
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:46,109
Ah, that's Ernie. He works for
beer. He looks a little tangled up.

215
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,647
Does he know anything about hooking
up that electrical equipment?

216
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,240
No.
Okay, okay. I'm ready to rock.

217
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,342
And who are you supposed
to be? Bob Dylan, man.

218
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,512
Jesus Christ. We are all over
the place. Check this out.

219
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:57,522
Is this a page from a coloring book?

220
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,854
No, dude. That's "Night
Man. " Those are lyrics.

221
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,757
Whatever. Let's just
rock. "Night Man," baby.

222
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,762
Okay, this is what I'm talking
about. Let's rock and roll!

223
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,559
Yeeha!
All right.

224
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,395
Where's my curtain? Don't worry about
the curtain. You're not gonna need it.

225
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:10,402
I want a curtain blocking
my face. You don't need it.

226
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,233
Go on. Go have a beer, Ernie.
Okay.

227
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,205
All right. Ready?

228
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:16,503
Five, six, seven, eight.

229
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:19,101
Night Man
sneaky and mean

230
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:22,079
Spider inside my dreams
I think I love you

231
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:24,708
You make me wanna cry
You make me wanna die

232
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:29,016
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, Night Man

233
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:32,251
Every night you come into
my room and pin me down

234
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,919
With your strong arms
You pin me down

235
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:38,088
And I try to fight you You
come inside me, You fill me up

236
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:40,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
And I become the Night Man

237
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,867
Charlie, Charlie. Whoa,
Charlie, hold on a second.

238
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:45,768
The first half of that song was kinda
cool, but what's with the second half?

239
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,398
It's about the Night Man, like,
filling me up, and I become him.

240
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,408
I become the spirit
of the Night Man.

241
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:53,036
It sounds like a song where a man
breaks into your house and rapes you.

242
00:12:53,112 --> 00:12:55,103
What, dude? Where are you
getting that from? All right. No.

243
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,411
It's just two men
sharing the night

244
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:59,815
It might seem wrong
but it's just right

245
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:02,320
It's just two men
sharing each other

246
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:04,879
It's just two men
like lovin' brothers

247
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:06,891
One on top and one on bottom

248
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,723
One inside and one is out

249
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,458
One is screamin'
He's so happy

250
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,466
The other's screamin'
a passionate shout

251
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:18,527
It's the Night Man They're
feeling so wrong and right, man

252
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:21,072
They're feeling so wrong and right, man

253
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,700
I can't fight you, man
when you come inside me

254
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:26,711
And pin me down
with your strong hands

255
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,772
And I become the Night

256
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,546
The passionate
passionate Night Man

257
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:36,417
We need a new front man. Right. You
want someone with a good voice...

258
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:37,979
Yes.
Who's attractive...

259
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,547
Yes.
Someone with charisma.

260
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,026
Yes. Well, I've got an
awful lot of reading to do.

261
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:45,256
Do you wanna be in
the band or not, dude?

262
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,492
Can I wear spandex?
I'd rather you didn't.

263
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,002
I think I'm gonna wear spandex.

264
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,004
Are you ready?
Yeah. Let me see it.

265
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,006
What if I did something
like this? Ready? Let me see.

266
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:58,271
I give a kick, but then I'm gonna stomp
down. A kick is good, stomp is good.

267
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:00,278
You know what mean? Like...

268
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:04,683
That's good. Every time I
stomp, you do that. That's good.

269
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,809
Oh, man. Really?

270
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:09,684
Come on, dude. What's with
the sash and the codpiece?

271
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:12,451
Don't be afraid of a
little sex appeal, Mac.

272
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:15,289
You look like a drag queen.
I look like a rock god.

273
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,091
All right, here's the song.

274
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,189
What the hell is this, a
page from a coloring book?

275
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:23,724
It's a song Charlie wrote. It's called "Night
Man. " Skip the raping parts and get on stage.

276
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:26,431
Very well. Well, I just
broke up with Kevin.

277
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,303
We're trying to practice. I can't
do it. I can't get it out of my head.

278
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,843
I don't know if he's retarded,
but I can't stop thinking about it.

279
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,038
Dee, we're trying to
have band practice here.

280
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:36,308
I was gonna ride this guy to
the top. You know what I mean?

281
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,612
He was gonna put me in
one of his rap videos.

282
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:41,517
Look, the guy's not retarded, okay?

283
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:44,385
What? Yeah. I was just
saying that to mess with you.

284
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,687
Why? Why would you do
something like that?

285
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,523
I thought it'd be funny.
It's not funny.

286
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:54,089
It's not funny at all. This guy's perfect for
me, and you've blown it and ruined everything.

287
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,624
You are a bad, bad person.

288
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:00,365
Ew.
All right. Ready, guys?

289
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,805
So, that guy's not retarded?

290
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,139
Oh, no, he's totally retarded.

291
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,146
All right, let's rock.
Five, six, seven, eight.

292
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:27,897
They took you, Night Man
and you don't belong to them

293
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,730
They locked me in
a world of darkness

294
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,738
Without your sexy hands

295
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:39,176
And I miss you, Night Man
so bad

296
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:45,711
Stupid, can't write...

297
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,844
Charlie?
Oh, oh.

298
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,115
Let's join forces.
Hello! Come right in.

299
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:52,248
I will.
What happened to your band?

300
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:55,726
Kicked me out. Well,
it hurts, doesn't it?

301
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:58,195
Hmm. What's with the, uh, curtains?

302
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:00,892
I'm living in a world of darkness.

303
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:04,095
Right. Let's get some light in here.

304
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,399
Whoa. What's with
the spray paint, man?

305
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:12,205
Uh... What's with your outfit, man?

306
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:14,303
Why don't we put the
curtains back up? No, no.

307
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:18,381
What is going on up here?

308
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,976
I never know, man.

309
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:23,613
Daylight.

310
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:26,021
Yeah, I like that.

311
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:28,720
Day... Day Man

Do you want some?

You're a master of karate
and friendship for everyone

322
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:01,284

00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:42,527
Get off the stage!
Day Man

333
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,535
Come on.
All right, rock it.

334
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,503

338
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:01,553
Screw you guys.
Goddamn it, Charlie.

339
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,316
I'm so glad we worked out.

340
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,722
I'm sorry I was
all wishy-washy before.

341
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,352
Yeah, girl. You was more
mixed-up than a milk shake.

342
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,363
I know. It's my brother's fault
though. You're not gonna believe this.

343
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:16,868
He tried to convince me that
you were retarded. Uh, what?

344
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:19,370
Yo, what? That's bananas, girl.
I know.

345
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:21,599
You're not retarded, are you?

346
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:28,110
All right, Paddy's! You ready to rock?

347
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,411
Yeah! No? Yeah!

348
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,888
What up, Paddy's? Make some noise!

349
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:42,792
Get off. Get off the stage, idiot.
Come on, idiot. Come on. Let's go.

350
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:45,330
Come on.
Okay.

351
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:48,423
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bust
a little freestyle for you.

352
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:53,029
This one's for my girl, Dee. This
one's for you, baby. Word! Yo!

353
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,539
Let me tell y'all a
story 'bout a girl I knew

354
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,042
A brokeass bitch
with a gayass crew

355
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,544
She said that I was cute
She said that I was funny

356
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,241
But the honey couldn't
stop lookin' at my money

357
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:05,783
Busted old lady
with a flat tiny ass

358
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,376
Her body like a
skeleton in science class

359
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,718
Face beat up by the
school of hard knocks

360
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,723
Hair so fried and bleached by Clorox

361
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,453
It's like she's skinny but
fat in all the wrong places

362
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,462
Mothers gotta cover
their babies' faces

363
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,691
When she walks by people
think she's Godzilla

364
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,064
Straight out of Compton No,
y'all, straight outta "Thriller"

365
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:25,330
Looking like a zombie
Walking like a chicken

366
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:27,929
Mouth full of shit That's
why her breath be stinkin'

367
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:30,805
Just one question, Dee
before you take your bow

368
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:33,504
This gravy train's leavin'
so who's retarded now

369
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:39,908
Hey. Ladies.

370
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,919
Later, bitch.

371
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:47,323
I don't think he's retarded.
Mmmmm.

372
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:49,327
Hmm.
