1
00:00:03,013 --> 00:00:03,880
_

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:07,089
_

3
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:08,957
Come on, this way.

4
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:12,461
Clear the room.

5
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,671
All clear, nobody's here.

6
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,135
It sounds like it got quiet out there.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,011
Yeah.

8
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,805
Shit! Frank! There's somebody here.

9
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:26,725
Is anybody here?

10
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,061
Speak up... we will shoot.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,682
Wait, hold your fire, Frank!
It's just a kid.

12
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,233
Hey, boy.

13
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,902
Is that water for us?

14
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,859
Jesus Christ, Frank,
you just killed a kid!

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,155
Eh.

16
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,746
Jesus Christ!

17
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,164
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,749
I'm gonna give him CPR.

19
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,706
Now, is he blowing someone?
What is happening?

20
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,374
- Yeah, looks like it.
- Jesus Christ,

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,759
Frank, he was just trying
to give us water, man!

22
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,127
Forget it, he's dead.

23
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,671
You can't go around killing kids!

24
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:04,880
Think about his mom and his dad.

25
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:05,965
How long they been playing this for?

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,966
Oh, dude...

27
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,967
three straight days.

28
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,185
They've been playing this

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,219
- for three days?
- Yeah, absolutely.

30
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:11,804
Jesus Christ, have they slept?

31
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,639
No. No, they've just been
wandering around the bar,

32
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,474
blowing kids, doing whatever
they're doing, you know?

33
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,276
- Frank, behind you!
- Is this where we're headed?

34
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:18,394
I mean, as a world? Know what I mean...

35
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:19,645
as a society?

36
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,531
Hey, uh, have any of you
seen my guy yet?

37
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:23,555
Oh, what is this, now?

38
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:24,356
- What? Who?
- Huh?

39
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:25,651
- What do you want to tell us? Just tell us.
- Oh, I just

40
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,319
totally hooked up with this super hot

41
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:29,538
stripper soldier last night.
He's swinging by.

42
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:30,706
- Oh, you're dating a stripper.
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,707
Wow, gross.

44
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,409
Gross? If you guys started

45
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:34,877
dating a stripper you'd
be bragging about it

46
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,712
for days. I meet myself a Channing Tatum

47
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,831
and suddenly it's gross?

48
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:39,999
A what... a charming taint man?

49
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,750
What words is she trying to say?

50
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,003
- Uh, she's talking about Channing Tatum.
- Oh.

51
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,171
- He's an actor.
- What do I know him in?

52
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:46,972
- Well, he-he plays G.I. Joe.
- Oh!

53
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:49,141
- G.I... Oh, G.I. Joe's the shit.
- G.I. Joe. - Yeah, yeah.

54
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,976
- Well, then say G.I. Joe, don't make up a name.
- All right, you know what,

55
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,344
whatever. It doesn't matter. Anyway,

56
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,145
we had this really amazing connection

57
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:55,877
and the sex was so meaningful,

58
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:57,212
both of us wept tears of joy.

59
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,514
- Makes me want to throw up.
- Yeah.

60
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,549
- Just what happened.
- You know what I think is happening

61
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,883
right now? I think the guy's

62
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:03,435
coming by because you stole his watch.

63
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,603
Oh, right, you jacked
his wallet or something

64
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,354
so he'd come over and you-you...

65
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,690
- Yeah.
- Right? Just to get him to talk to you again.

66
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,142
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,911
- Hello. Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

68
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:13,395
Hey. Thanks for calling me.

69
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,981
- Yeah. Thanks for coming by.
- So you have my watch?

70
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,285
- Oh...
- Yeah. Just diving

71
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,703
straight into that, huh?

72
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,455
Listen, um, I'm really glad
you called, though.

73
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,207
I really wanted to thank
you for last night.

74
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:26,825
Thank<i> you</i> for last night.

75
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,160
Yeah. It's like, we were

76
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,328
having sex and the whole time

77
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,329
- Yeah.
- I was like,

78
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,830
"What's become of me?"

79
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,300
You know,
all I do is I strip all night, I play

80
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,502
video games all day,
I have meaningless sex

81
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:37,636
with strangers.

82
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:38,721
My own daughter won't even

83
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,888
talk to me, you know? So I was

84
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:41,890
like... "Damn."

85
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,892
And I realized I hit rock bottom.

86
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,011
Oh.

87
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:47,563
And that's why I was crying.

88
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,815
Oh. Right, yeah.

89
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah. But don't-don't take it personally.

90
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,435
No. Because it... Why would it be?

91
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,937
- All right, cool.
- It's...

92
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:56,522
- Yeah, cool.
- Cool, 'cause it really

93
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:58,991
helped me realize that I got
to give that lifestyle up.

94
00:02:59,076 --> 00:02:59,992
- Oh...
- So thank you.

95
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,493
You're welcome.

96
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,330
Um... I don't remember your name.

97
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:07,916
Dee.

98
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,501
Dee?

99
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:11,453
- Yeah.
- Cool.

100
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:14,540
Now, can I get that watch, or...

101
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,292
- Hey, Dee, I think he just wants his watch.
- I think he needs his...

102
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,343
- Yeah, I understand.
- Yeah.

103
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:18,344
Oh, yeah, yeah.

104

105
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:43,407
Rock bottom? Me?
Uh, hey, buddy, how about when

106
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,658
your daughter stopped talking to you...

107
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:46,076
Maybe that was your rock bottom, okay?

108
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,327
I'm not rock bottom.

109
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,279
You know what I am? I'm a rock.

110
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,582
Dee is a rock.
In fact, I'm the type of gal

111
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,485
who makes men's lives better.

112
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:56,203
Hey-o! You guys mind if I shower
in that leaky urinal again?

113
00:03:58,841 --> 00:03:59,840
Well, that... Don't count that.

114
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,091
That's not a good example.

115
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:04,044
No, I got... I got to do something
about this, goddamn it.

116
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,679
I am gonna fix this problem,
'cause I'm gonna

117
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:06,964
tell you something right now:

118
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,800
Sweet Dee is a rock.

119
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,552
Goddamn it, Frank, you shot a woman.

120
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,353
- Who cares?
- Jesus Christ, man,

121
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:15,689
- I got to stop. This is too real.
- What, what?

122
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,140
I got to take a break, dude.

123
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,725
It's driving me insane.

124
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,861
Come on, how are we gonna
win if you keep quitting?

125
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,195
I don't care!

126
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:23,614
- Lot of storm-outs today, huh?
- Yeah.

127
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,482
- Yeah. Yeah.
- This is pathetic.

128
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,783
Dee can't handle a little rejection.

129
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:29,119
Mac's banged up
over a goddamn video game.

130
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,203
- Yeah.
- It's...

131
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:32,039
stripper guy is traumatized

132
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:33,991
because he gets to take his clothes off

133
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:35,742
in front of a bunch of horny ladies.

134
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:38,161
- Yeah.
- And then he has sex with one disgusting bird.

135
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,546
- Yeah.
- Come on, man,

136
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,415
- that's not trauma. That's not real trauma.
- Nah. It's not even

137
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,966
- that bad.
- I mean, if... if anything,

138
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:43,967
that's insulting to people

139
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,052
- who have experienced real trauma.
- Yeah.

140
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,053
- I think it is. Yeah.
- I mean, like

141
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,421
you, for instance.

142
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,922
Uh, me?

143
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,173
Well, yeah. Sure, man.

144
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,308
I mean, you grew up fatherless.

145
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,894
You were raised by a woman
who was basically a prostitute.

146
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:55,145
Well, the father stuff was real.

147
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,146
Yeah, without a doubt.

148
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,147
Got some daddy issues there.

149
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,265
And-and you, too. I mean,

150
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,816
like, you know,
what happened with you...

151
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,768
with Ms. Klinsky, the librarian.
I mean, you were raped.

152
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:03,353
- Ah. No. St...
- And tha-that's got to affect you.

153
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,287
- That's trauma.
- Will you stop?

154
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:06,440
Why do you guys br... no.
That wasn't a rape, okay?

155
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:07,991
- It was.
- That was a mutual... No, stop. Like...

156
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:09,610
She's an older woman,
you were a younger...

157
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:11,078
A woman can't rape a guy.

158
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:12,863
- An older woman can rape a younger...
- It's not...

159
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:14,164
- Doesn't matter. That's not the point.
- Oh, yeah. Right, right.

160
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:15,165
- This is separate, yeah.
- Look, it's...

161
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,333
It's not the point. The point is,

162
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,168
yeah, fine, I'll do it.

163
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:20,253
You'll do what?

164
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:21,838
I'll strip. Yeah.

165
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:24,124
Huh. I didn't realize you
were talking about that.

166
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,175
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,209
- Huh.
- You know,

168
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:28,345
if this Mike fella wants to walk away

169
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,130
from an amazing stripping career,

170
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,715
hey, I'll take up that mantle.

171
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,133
You know, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed

172
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:34,635
in myself for not thinking of it before.

173
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,886
You know? It just makes sense.

174
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:36,887
Right, yeah.

175
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,939
Here's the thing, man.
I can't do it without you.

176
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,057
I need you to get my back.

177
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,309
Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?

178
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:43,894
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

179
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,445
I-I-I... no, I just literally

180
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,563
need you to have a look at my back,
you know,

181
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,698
make sure there's no moles

182
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:48,782
or, like, unsightly hairs,

183
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:49,783
bumps, zits, you know,

184
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:50,784
- that kind of thing.
- Ah, yeah...

185
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:51,785
And then, you know, get after it.

186
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:52,953
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll clean you up.

187
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:53,987
All right, all right, I can do that.

188
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:55,288
- Cool.
- Cool, man. You be my boy?

189
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:56,657
Yeah, I'll be the boy.

190
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:58,458
Well, just be my... L-like my bag boy.

191
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,160
You know, carry around my-my lotions,

192
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,995
my oils, my scents, my razors.

193
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:03,213
Cool, man. Chill, chill.

194
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,581
Yeah, that's cool, right?

195
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,283
- Yeah, that's cool, bro. Cool.
- Cool.

196
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,024
_

197
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:09,720
Frank, where are you, man?

198
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:10,804
I can't see.

199
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,256
Jesus Christ.

200
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:17,227
Oh, who's there?! Oh...

201
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,679
Hey, boy.

202
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:19,846
How you doing, man?

203
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,403
No! Baba!

204
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:27,418
_

205
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:28,572
Mother!

206
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:30,023
Oh, shit!

207
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,241
Oh, no, man!

208
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,325
I'm so sorry, man.

209
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,279
Hey, son.

210
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:38,415
Dad?! What are you doing here?

211
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,533
How did you get in the game?

212
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,118
Guess we...

213
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,253
won't be having that catch

214
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:44,871
after all.

215
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:46,339
You were gonna have a catch with me?

216
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,292
I was, but...

217
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:52,796
you killed me, son.

218
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,299
I... love...

219
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,137
Wa-Wa... Wait! Wait, Dad!
Who do you love?

220
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:01,972
Dad, who do you love? Wait.

221
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:05,392
Dad, who do you love? No, Dad! No!

222
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:10,864
What the hell?

223
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:13,116
Oh, was that a dream?

224
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:14,785
Dennis?

225
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,154
Oh, my God, man,
I just had the weirdest dream.

226
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:08,588
- What?
- Frank.

227
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:11,291
Look, I-I... I can't sleep.
I'm having nightmares.

228
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,176
- Dead kids, dads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mac.

229
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:14,795
Slow down. What are you saying?

230
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,379
I got to quit the game, dude. I can't

231
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:17,798
- do this anymore.
- No, no, no.

232
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:19,466
Don't quit just yet.

233
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,102
- Look, have a drink and calm down.
- Okay, fine.

234
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,721
I'll calm down. I'll-I'll
drink some whiskey or something.

235
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:26,723
Yeah, stuff it down with brown.

236
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,775
That's the best way to deal with things.

237
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:30,310
Okay.

238
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,896
Kid's a mess.

239
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,161
Goddamn it, Charlie,
we're 30 minutes late, man.

240
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,446
I'm so sorry I cut your
back so many times, man.

241
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:42,048
- What happened?
- I was nervous, dude.

242
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,540
- Why?
- I've never, like, cut such a muscular back.

243
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,659
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Oh, dude, your back looks great, man.

244
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:48,086
I'm working hard, dude.

245
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,287
Dude, you're putting the work in,
and it's showing, man.

246
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:51,464
- Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.
- Yeah, right, right, right, right.

247
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,064
But just let's not
talk about it in there.

248
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:53,865
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Don't bring it up.

249
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,478
Can you walk me through
what your guy is again?

250
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:57,097
Okay, so here's the deal, man.

251
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,732
Who do girls want to have sex
with more than anybody else?

252
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:00,767
- Jugglers.
- Jug...?

253
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:02,686
- Dudes who can, like, juggle things.
- I know what a juggler is.

254
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:03,937
- You know, with the fire sticks and the balls.
- Yeah.

255
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:05,655
No, they don't want to
have sex with a juggler.

256
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,657
They want to have sex with their dads.

257
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:11,327
- Weird.
- Yeah, it is weird, so I'm a dad.

258
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,349
Oh. Okay, cool. Oh, and I'm your boy.

259
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:16,936
- All right, that works.
- Well, no. What? Why would you be my boy?

260
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:19,261
Oh, you said I was gonna be your boy
'cause I have daddy trauma,

261
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,092
and then, I didn't realize
I was gonna be your boy

262
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:21,908
in there, but that works great.

263
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:23,326
No, that doesn't make any sense.

264
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:24,694
How would you be my s...?

265
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,790
I'm their dad.
How could I also be your dad?

266
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,365
We can't all be related. Christ, Charlie,
you're not making any sense, man.

267
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,667
Yeah, I mean,
you could have a lot of kids, I guess.

268
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,703
I got to say, though,
I'm looking inside there,

269
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:35,038
and this isn't making sense to me.

270
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:36,672
I mean, these are all older women.
Might be

271
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,791
a little bit hard for me to
pull off the dad thing at all.

272
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:39,897
- That's not a good play.
- You know,

273
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,393
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this, man.

274
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:43,096
Hey, man, do you think
maybe that's 'cause

275
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,798
- of your librarian trauma?
- You're talking about Ms. Klinsky?

276
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,517
- Yeah, she was an older woman, and...
- What? No. There was...

277
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,769
Let's not talk...
Can we stop talking about trauma

278
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,721
- and-and-and cuts on the... on peoples' backs?
- Yes.

279
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,306
And let's... It's not sexy, okay?

280
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,891
- Okay, yeah, well, then let's split.
- Okay.

281
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:56,726
- All right, let's go.
- All right, man.

282
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,611
Are you the stripper?

283
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:00,426
- Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.
- Uh...

284
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:02,398
- What, are you 40?
- Yup.

285
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,067
Fine. You guys'll do, I guess.

286
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,402
Y-You guys? No. Sorry. I'm just the boy.

287
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,321
- The what? - Just...
- Sorry. I'm-I'm<i> his</i> boy.

288
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:10,474
Well, you're not my boy.
He's not...

289
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,493
Are you gonna stand out here
and talk like little bitches,

290
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:17,130
or are you gonna come inside and
take your dicks out for money?

291
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:20,249
Daddy?

292
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,219
Just don't call me Daddy.

293
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:25,951
<i>Yeah, my generation...</i>

294
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,113
we drank our problems away.

295
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,333
But since you softies like
to talk about everything,

296
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:33,309
I figured this was a good thing to do.

297
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:35,271
A PTSD support group, Frank?

298
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,240
Yeah, yeah. Maybe you'll get some help,

299
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,942
- we can finish the damn game.
- What's up, dicks?

300
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:41,661
What the hell are you doing here?

301
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,247
Well, because I am a rock and
not a rock bottom, I decided

302
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:47,033
to reach out to Mike and see
if I could get him some help

303
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:48,618
with, uh, some of these issues
he's been having.

304
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,953
I'm confused.
Is this a PTSD meeting for vets?

305
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,256
Mm-hmm, yeah.
You're a military guy, right?

306
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,791
No. It was just my stripper character.

307
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,593
Really? Oh, I just figured you based

308
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,630
- your characters off past experiences.
- Why?

309
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:04,217
Okay, look, I-I'm not gonna
pass myself off as a vet, Frank.

310
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:05,685
- Yeah, I don't feel good about this. Maybe...
- Well, then just don't talk.

311
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,303
- But...
- You don't have to talk. Just sit down.

312
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,639
Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair,
let's get this started.

313
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:12,391
- Probably not gonna call on you anyway.
- Okay, right off

314
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,310
the bat, I can see we got some newcomers

315
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,979
here today. You guys
want to introduce yourselves?

316
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,481
Ugh. Goddamn it.

317
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,149
Uh, I'm Frank.

318
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,618
I've been around the block,
seen some action.

319
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:24,320
I was in 'Nam for a while.

320
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,038
Private sector mostly.

321
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,573
I did shoot a couple of dinks

322
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,126
who tried to jack some
sneakers off the factory floor.

323
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,410
No big deal.

324
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,079
I don't feel nothing about it.

325
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,498
I'm just here to support my buddy.

326
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,250
Uh...

327
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,051
Hello. I'm Dee. I'm a rock.

328
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm here with this guy.

329
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:43,422
There was a bit of a mix-up
about his military credentials,

330
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,841
but, uh... whatever.

331
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,561
Now he's under the delusion
that he's hit rock bottom,

332
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,565
you know, and I just don't see
how that's possibly true, so,

333
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:54,567
we're gonna straighten
that up while we're

334
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,185
sitting here today, you know.

335
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,603
Mac's being a pussy!

336
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,021
He doesn't want to fight anymore!

337
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,439
I'm not being a pussy.

338
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:01,824
I just don't want to
kill women and children.

339
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:02,858
How do I get him

340
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,827
to stop thinking of them as real people?

341
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,195
Mike's embarrassed about his dancing,

342
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,947
and I just... I don't get that.

343
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,865
I don't... How is that
rock bottom behavior?

344
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,417
You know? Think of Channing Tatum.

345
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:13,286
Can you please explain
Channing Tatum to him?

346
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,755
- I'm not sure I follow...
- Oh, yeah. He's G.I. Joe.

347
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:16,956
Mac can't sleep at night.

348
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,675
He's having erotic nightmares and shit.

349
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,427
- He doesn't know what's real anymore.
- Yeah.

350
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:24,096
Mike's embarrassed about his
video game-playing, which makes

351
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:26,349
no sense to me, 'cause you know what?
Video games are hard.

352
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,551
- You ever play <i>Fallujah?</i>
- Beat it five times.

353
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:30,853
- You want to play with me?
- I'm actually trying to get away from that.

354
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:32,305
Well, what if he paid you?

355
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,184
Ten bucks an hour.

356
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,185
- 20.
- Deal.

357
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,440
- Wow. Really?
- Well, will you look at that?

358
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:38,032
Now we're getting somewhere, huh?

359
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,031
- Yeah.
- That couldn't have happened

360
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:40,620
without your rock, could it?

361
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:41,814
Wait a second, Frank. What about me?

362
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,232
You're out. Dishonorable discharge.

363
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:44,617
I'm sorry.

364
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:46,235
What is happening here?

365
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:47,536
Doesn't matter. We're done with you.

366
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:48,821
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yeah.

367
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:58,798
- Hey, son.
- Dad?!

368
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,083
What are you doing here?

369
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,803
I broke out of jail and
came straight to see you.

370
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:08,024
- Because you love me?
- 'Cause I'm gonna kill you, son.

371
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:09,809
Oh. Oh, no!

372
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,680
What...? What-What's happening?

373
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,432
When did I get here?
How long have I been asleep?

374
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,983
You got here, like, five minutes ago.

375
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,518
You've been asleep for 35 seconds.

376
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:21,237
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I'm-I'm losing my mind.

377
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,988
- I mean, I'm actually going insane.
- You know,

378
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,523
we're all having a little
bit of a hard time right now.

379
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:26,025
- Yeah.
- But we got to fight fire with fire,

380
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,576
and Charlie and I refuse
to be defeated by this.

381
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:28,994
We're gonna win this war.

382
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:29,867
What war?

383
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:32,125
- The war on women!
- Women, man!

384
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,116
There's a war on women?
Can I get in on that?

385
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:36,952
Bro, it's been raging
since the beginning of time, bro.

386
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,454
- Oh.
- And we're losing ground.

387
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:40,039
Phone!

388
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,426
- Hello.
- Ah, yeah.

389
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,795
Uh, yeah, is youse Daddy and the Boy?

390
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,798
- Uh, y-yes, it is. Boy speaking.
- Oh.

391
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:52,385
Yeah. Uh, I hear
youse are re... rule good.

392
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,136
Well, yeah, that-that is true.

393
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:55,855
Well, I've got a party for you.

394
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,023
- Um, Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Yeah.

395
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,476
Yeah, this is Daddy.
What's-what's the gig?

396
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,362
Uh, yeah, a giant party.
Tons of sorority girls.

397
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:05,281
Sorority girls.
Oh, sorority girls. Nice.

398
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,033
Did you just lick your hand?
Yeah, that...

399
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:11,237
that sounds good. Um, listen,
a few new ground rules, though.

400
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:13,456
I'm a bad dad now. And, uh,

401
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,291
the Boy's also gonna be dancing with me.

402
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,293
Okay. Uh, whatever. Uh, uh...

403
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,328
Yeah, we need Mike. We need him.

404
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,831
- Mike? Why do you want Mike, Dee?
- What? You knew it was me?

405
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:24,049
Of course I knew it was you.
Who else does accents so poorly?

406
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,330
The accents were terrible.

407
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,331
- The accents were terrible.
- All right, look, I just...

408
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:28,564
I want him to have fun,
make a ton of money,

409
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,165
party with a bunch of sorority girls,
you know?

410
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,001
I need to show him that
this is a great life.

411
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,919
This is not a rock-bottom life.

412
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,504
We'll do it at Paddy's.
It'll be a win-win.

413
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,673
- Make a ton of mon...
- Mmm.

414
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:40,509
Yes. Okay.

415
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,344
What? Hello?

416
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,896
Goddamn it.

417
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,231
This is good.
This is... th-this is good.

418
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,651
Young girl sorority girls.
It's, like, age-appropriate for me,

419
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:50,986
you know? Not like
those perverted librarians.

420
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,405
- Cougars. Whatever, man.
- Yeah.

421
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,441
And it's gonna be on our home turf.
Like, Paddy's.

422
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:57,359
- Whoa. And with Mike, we'll be like a...
- Oh.

423
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,778
We'll be like an elite stripping
dance force, like a unit, man.

424
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,121
Dude, dude, dude, dude,

425
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,122
- we're gonna look good, man.
- Yeah. Yeah, man.

426
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,217
We're gonna win this war.

427
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,618
- Oh, hell yeah. Oh, yeah.
- We're gonna win this war on women.

428
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,202
You know what, Mac,
maybe we could use you after all.

429
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,557
- He's asleep.
- Yeah, he's out.

430
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:11,874
_

431
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,798
It's amazing!
I can't believe they have zombies

432
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,216
on the final level!

433
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:23,469
I love zombies.
Ghouls, too. I love ghouls.

434
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,988
Right now, if we can just
make it to that second box

435
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,439
over there,
we can grab the all spark coin

436
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:28,941
and we can win the game.

437
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,139
<i>Frank. Frank.</i>

438
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:44,957
Frank!

439
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:45,991
Frank!

440
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,577
Oh. What happened?

441
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,779
- Where am I?
- Oh, you're in the back office.

442
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:52,363
You passed out playing the game, dude.

443
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:53,364
We dragged you back here
so you could sleep.

444
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,884
Oh, Mac. I think I was too hard on you.

445
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,220
I think I got PTSD, too.

446
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,805
- Oh, no. We don't have that.
- Huh?

447
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,557
Yeah, I actually slept about
ten hours last night, dude,

448
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:03,092
and I feel great.

449
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,511
I think we were just suffering
from sleep deprivation.

450
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,596
Well, where's Mike?
I want to finish the game.

451
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,398
Oh, we finished the game.
Yeah, like, right after

452
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,233
you passed out,
Mike and I just got in there.

453
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,318
- Dude, it was awesome.
- Do you want to do it again?

454
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,853
No, I don't want to play anymore.

455
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,522
Well, where's Mike? I'll do it with him.

456
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,107
He's out, too. Yeah, he's doing

457
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:19,942
some weird stripping thing
with Dennis and Charlie.

458
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,111
I only woke you up
'cause I figured you'd want to see it.

459
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:23,946
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

460
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:32,845
I really appreciate you getting me

461
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,096
this gig. I mean, truthfully,

462
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:36,732
I don't think I was ready
to give this lifestyle up.

463
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:38,183
Of course not. Why would you?
You're really good

464
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,985
at dancing.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

465
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,154
Listen, you like video games?
I got you paid for it.

466
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,773
You're a great stripper?
I got you this gig.

467
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,441
- And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?
- What?

468
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm gonna reunite you
with your daughter.

469
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,828
- Oh, man.
- Yep.

470
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:52,247
Look, I really appreciate
everything you've done.

471
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,950
- It really, really means a lot to me.
- Eh, well,

472
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:57,002
you just needed your rock.

473
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:58,147
Fire it up.

474
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,648
- Smell good? Everything poppin'?
- All right. No, feels good.

475
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:00,803
- Look good?
- I don't know. What do you think?

476
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:01,604
- You like how it smells?
- It looks good.

477
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,115
- And you can't see any of the blood.
- Okay, good.

478
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:03,616
It's all patched up good.

479
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:05,377
- What do you think about my prop, hmm?
- That's really cool.

480
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,379
- A little kid licking that up there.
- Wait, what-what am I smelling?

481
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:08,237
Cheese.

482
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,238
- Is that made of cheese?
- Yeah, yeah.

483
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,310
And then I painted the rest with,
like, magic marker and stuff.

484
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,135
Oh, Christ. Why did you make
a cheese lollipop? It stinks.

485
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,970
- For-for my nerves. Yeah.
- That smells horrible.

486
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:17,105
Oh, God. There's nothing sexy
about cheese. Put it away.

487
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:21,894
Ladies, are we ready
to party tonight?

488
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,947
So am I.

489
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,148
All right.

490
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:28,901
We're gonna see some skin
tonight. Yeah.

491
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,152
Scars and all.

492
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,177
This, actually, is a real scar, too.

493
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:33,739
And I got a good story behind that.

494
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:36,325
This is, uh...
They took out the kidney, actually,

495
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,327
from the fron... A Chinaman.
And he did not know

496
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:39,878
how to do it, I'll tell you that much.

497
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:41,797
Cricket was a bad idea, huh?

498
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:43,715
Yeah, I know.
But we needed that, like, you know,

499
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,718
- McConaughey emcee-type.
- Yeah. But looks like we got

500
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,720
AIDS<i> Dallas Buyers Club</i> McConaughey,

501
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,889
- not<i> Magic Mike</i> McConaughey.
- That is what he looks like.

502
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,557
- It's a good crowd, though. It's a good crowd.
- He's... Yeah.

503
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:54,009
All right, well...

504
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:55,260
That was the first time
that I really thought,

505
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,262
"Hey, I might actually, uh...

506
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:01,400
I might die, and...
and no one's gonna remember."

507
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,627
All right! Hey!

508
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:06,853
Let's, uh, keep it movin'.

509
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,913
Keepin' it real, keepin' it sexy,

510
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,915
and takin' back the power,

511
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,752
let's give it up for Daddy and the Boy!

512
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,178
Hey, Boy, let's have a catch.

513
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,547
Over here, Pop.

514
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,559
Hey. Good throw, son.

515
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:32,798
I love you, Dad!

516
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,216
- I love you, too, son.
- Oh?

517
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:36,001
And even though I never
even said it enough.

518
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:36,969
What is this?

519
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:37,970
I wasn't a good... Shh!

520
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,639
I wasn't a good father to you,
and-and I regret that now.

521
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,975
No, that's fine, because now
is our chance to connect.

522
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:44,009
This is super weird.

523
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,811
Hey! Shush, all right?

524
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,013
This is our thing.
We have the power. You don't talk.

525
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,431
All right, you know what,
Dad, don't listen to them,

526
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:50,899
'cause we're gonna win this war.

527
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:52,151
This is not sexy!

528
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,402
Just take something off!

529
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:54,653
You know, you take something off!

530
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,605
All right, look,
it's too hot for baseball.

531
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,774
I'm gonna take my clothes off now.
I think.

532
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:01,360
- Okay!
- Yeah, now we'll take our clothes off.

533
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:02,709
Yeah!

534
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,581
Wait, wait, son, don't.
Don't. They're laughing.

535
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,616
Don't take your clothes off if
they're laughing. We have the power.

536
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:10,002
- It's not a joke!
- It's not a joke, all right? This is sexy.

537
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:12,955
Oh, stop, sto... Oh, you know what?

538
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,673
You might want to check your programs
'cause I'm bad dad now.

539
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,175
I'll take you to your goddamn room.

540
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:19,094
- I'll bend you over my knee.
- Take your dicks out!

541
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,381
All right, listen to me. This is it,
this is what you were made for.

542
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:26,011
Now you get out there
and save the day, soldier.

543
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,288
This is about a father and a son

544
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:32,774
- whose relation...
- Oh, come on!

545
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,487
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

546
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,162
Soldier boy, Mike.

557
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,113
- Oh!
- Your cock was in my face!

558
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,198
Oh, God, I didn't mean to!
I didn't mean to!

559
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,450
You're disgusting!

560
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,285
My finger touched your asshole!

561
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:29,038
Never talk to me again!

562
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:31,290
I got you!

563
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,709
I got you. I'm your rock bottom?

564
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:35,544
I'm your rock...
That's your rock bottom,

565
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,763
sticking your dick in your
daughter's face, you son of a bitch.

566
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,614
- Why would you do that?!
- Get out of here!

567
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,099
That's my daughter!

568
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,345
Oh.

569
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:44,903
Yes!

570
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,273
- Wow.
- Jesus Christ.

571
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,659
- Wow, Dee, that was dark.
- That's like the darkest thing you've ever done.

572
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:51,910
You know what that was?

573
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:53,612
- That was your rock bottom.
- Yeah.

574
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:55,163
- Yeah. - Hmm.
- Whatever.

575
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,332
Feel good.
I don't want to talk about it.

576
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,117
I don't want to talk about my thing.
You want to talk about your thing?

577
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:00,454
- No, no, let's not.
- You know what we should do?

578
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,509
Let's just, uh... let's just get drunk.

579
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,510
- Yeah, come on.
- Let's not talk about trauma.

580
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:04,673
- Or deal with any of that shit.
- Woo.

581
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:06,124
Let's just have a good
time and get drunk, huh?

582
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,676
Stuff it down with some brown.
