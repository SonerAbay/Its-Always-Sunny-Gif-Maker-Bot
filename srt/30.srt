1
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:35,845
We keep putting more on, and
It's not showing up at all.

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,650
Well, then I guess cocaine
is weightless, all right?

3
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,657
I'm gonna file that up here actually.

4
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:43,455
What are you doing?
Cleaning my hands off.

5
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:46,361
What are you, a cat? Use a
towel. My mouth's right here.

6
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,422
We talked about this. No
getting high on the supply.

7
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:50,433
I'm not getting high. I'm
just cleaning my hands.

8
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,265
We have to be very careful, considering
our past addictions to glue and crack.

9
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:55,772
We got over that.
I got over that.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,707
I don't smoke crack anymore.
You huff glue every single day.

11
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,539
No, I don't.
No? Did you have any today?

12
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:07,310
It's still gross, Frank.
We made a thousand dollars.

13
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:09,979
No. I made a thousand
dollars. You didn't do shit.

14
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,215
You just sat in the car and read a
magazine. What the hell do I need you for?

15
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,224
Give me that money.
Every ho needs his pimp.

16
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:17,056
We got any vials around
here? Vials for what?

17
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,653
We went back to Bingo. We got
a little of the cocaine back...

18
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,562
with the money that
we got from the pills.

19
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:24,328
You better go back and get a gun,
because dealin' drugs is dangerous.

20
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:27,530
No, it isn't. It's a rich person's
drug. There's no danger involved.

21
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,971
It's, like, stockbrokers and
high-powered business executives.

22
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,975
We'll just go down
to Center City and...

23
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,375
Waltz into a board meeting, slap your
drugs down on the conference table...

24
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,414
and be, like, "Hey, you guys wanna
buy drugs? We're drug dealers. "

25
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:40,474
Are you saying that's not
gonna work? What are you saying?

26
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,041
What are you saying exactly?

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm saying that that is not
gonna... You don't like that idea?

28
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,190
At least we didn't become prostitutes.

29
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:49,920
I am not a prostitute. I am
providing... Let me handle this.

30
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:54,431
Dennis is providing a very important
service to lonely people in need.

31
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:56,194
Really? So he speaks for you now?
No.

32
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,667
I was... He doesn't have to
speak if he doesn't want to.

33
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:01,864
I don't? Really? No. You
leave everything to me.

34
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:05,431
All you have to do is sit there,
relax, have yourself a drink...

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,944
and just keep looking handsome.

36
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,412
Okay. I like that arrangement.
Get me a beer, Frank.

37
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,813
Oh, no beer. Too many calories.
Yep.

38
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,182
It's all about keeping
this body fit. Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:17,517
Ehheh. I'll get you a nice vodka tonic.

40
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,522
Well, that doesn't have
much calories...

41
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,524
so I think that's a smart... drink.

42
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,355
I take care of my boy.

43
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,888
Every time you talk, you
weaken the nation. Shut up.

44
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,263
Why you wanna hurt me? I'm not hurtin'
you. Just shut up and play cards.

45
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:33,030
You're judgin'. You
judge me all the time.

46
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:34,867
I'm just tryin' to
remain elegant over here.

47
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,736
Don't try so hard.
Remain quiet.

48
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:39,402
Oh! Youse guys got the
right idea with these.

49
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,741
It's, like, the perfect mix
of comfort and wind resistance.

50
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,906
They make that In men's?

51
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:46,643
Huh? I think this is
men's. Yeah, it's men's.

52
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,914
Listen, guys. I was thinkin' we go
down to Paddy's, put the squeeze on 'em.

53
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:52,285
We're right in the middle
of somethin' right now.

54
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:55,655
Don't you guys do anything besides
play cards and eat deli meats?

55
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,217
Go wash my car.

56
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:01,629
Fellas! I feel like I'm being
seriously underutilized here.

57
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,758
Look, if you just give me a chance...

58
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,496
I could show you how hard
I actually am.

59
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,664
What? That's right. I'm so hard
that people are scared of me.

60
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,106
And they should be, 'cause
I'll explode all over them.

61
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,644
What's the matter with
you? I'm eatin' here.

62
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:17,112
What? What are you
talkin' about, your dick?

63
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:20,810
My dick? No, I'm talkin' about my
brute force and my catlike reflexes.

64
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:24,514
You hear that, Anthony?
He's got catlike reflexes.

65
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:26,750
That's right.
Hands like a cat.

66
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:29,691
You know what? I think someone
just earned themselves a nickname.

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,625
Really? What?
Yep.

68
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:35,029
From now on, you'll be
known as Pussy Hands.

69
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:39,168
I'd like to go on record
saying I don't like Pussy Hands.

70
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:40,966
But Cougar Hands would be good.

71
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:44,201
Here's to you, Pussy Hands.
That's great. It's settled.

72
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,936
Hey, Pussy Hands, go wash my car.

73
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,808
How about Jaguar Hands?
Nah.

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,108
Leopard Hands?
Nah.

75
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,978
Panther Hands.
Nah.

76
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,040
Goddamn it.

77
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,780
Go get your saucer of milk, honey.

78
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:59,550
He does have gorgeous hands though.

79
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,753
Excuse us.
Excuse me. Sir? Ma'am?

80
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,385
Hi. Would you two
be interested in...

81
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,054
These people are just walking too fast.

82
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,621
You know what we should do? We
should go back to the country club.

83
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,224
Remember the country
club, with the jockeys?

84
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,566
This about the horse,
Charlie? It is about the horse.

85
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:17,096
Goddamn it. I'm pretty sure those
jockeys are raping that horse.

86
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,074
They're raping the shit out of
it. Excuse me, sir. Can I talk...

87
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:21,168
They're racing by us
as fast as they can.

88
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,873
These people are revved up. They're in
fifth gear, and we're stuck in first.

89
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:27,042
We need to boost our r.p.m.'s. 
Let's get goin' a little bit.

90
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:30,246
What are you suggesting?

91
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,846
A little dip into our Bolivian marching
powder, then we're back on the street.

92
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,983
Not in your nose. That's
how you become a drug addict.

93
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,687
Rub it all over your gums,
Dee. All over your gums.

94
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,559
Okay. Feel that? How's
that feel for you?

95
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,757
Whoa. I see what you mean, Charlie.

96
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:44,266
I see... It's like my mouth
is no longer a part of my head.

97
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,360
I kind of feel nothing,
but it feels so good.

98
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,234
That's the feeling you're going
for. That's where you wanna be at.

99
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,934
Keep reapplying every 10 to 15
minutes. That's what I've been doing.

100
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,499
It kinda wears down. What?
Charlie. Ten to 15 minutes?

101
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:56,206
No. We're gonna run out. No
more gumming for a little while.

102
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,214
No more gumming. We're good though.

103
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:00,182
I'm ready. I'm good.
I feel pretty good.

104
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,412
I feel weird, but pretty
good. Let's start the show.

105
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:05,250
Let's be like Wall Street
and... Rickety Cricket.

106
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,518
That's Rickety Cricket!
Rickety!

107
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,617
Rickety Cricket!
Rickety!

108
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,855
Rickety Cricket!
Rickety!

109
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,954
Where have you been
hiding? Where have you been?

110
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,192
They let you become a priest
again, huh? Congratulations.

111
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,236
It's the reverend. Hey,
man. How you doin', man?

112
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:21,237
Keep your head up,
Reverend. Keep the faith.

113
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:22,795
Bless you.

114
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:26,365
Oh. Yikes. I get it.
It's like... Okay.

115
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:28,378
Ever since you convinced
me to abandon the church...

116
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,471
my life has been in a bit of a tailspin.

117
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,817
Who? Me or Charlie?

118
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:37,581
You, Dee. You.

119
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,351
That doesn't ring a bell. There
was something that happened.

120
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,153
I wasn't sure that it was
that. I don't think it was that.

121
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:44,456
So you're livin' on the
streets now, Cricket.

122
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:47,497
Yes, I'm living... That's
great. That's really great.

123
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,692
Actually, it's the
opposite of great, Charlie.

124
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,962
It's one of the darkest
times of my life.

125
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:53,970
Is it? Is it? That makes sense. Yes.

126
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,735
But the good thing is that you
must know a lot of drug addicts.

127
00:05:57,808 --> 00:06:00,936
Yes. I was actually attacked by a
couple last night. Almost got stabbed.

128
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,810
Really? That's great.
Did you? Did you really?

129
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,349
Wonderful, Cricket. Then you
can help us sell our cocaine.

130
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,408
Do you know those guys?
Can you sell drugs to them?

131
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:11,284
Do you bump into them? Do you
guys hang out on certain corners?

132
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:12,845
Are you close?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

133
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,447
You want me to sell drugs for you?

134
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:17,085
We would do it, but we're not
street urchins. Yeah, man. Yeah.

135
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,719
Know what I mean?
But you.

136
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,559
They would buy drugs from a
street urchin like yourself.

137
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,496
You got the "street
urchin" thing goin' on.

138
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,694
Please stop calling me a street
urchin. I'm not a street urchin.

139
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,863
You are what you are now.
You know what I'm sayin'.

140
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,428
I was a priest. I have
a master's in theology.

141
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:32,943
That was then. This is now.
What good's it doing you?

142
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,468
I am trying to get my life back on track.
I don't think selling drugs is a smart move.

143
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,674
Uhoh. I'm sorry.
Come on, Cricket.

144
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,446
I guess Charlie and I didn't see you
sitting atop your homeless ivory tower.

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,010
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

146
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:47,057
What is your problem? You just
push my buttons, don't you?

147
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:48,955
You just enjoy pushing my buttons.

148
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:51,494
What have you done?
I've done nothing to her.

149
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,655
Can I stop this little lovers' quarrel?

150
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,494
You're not fooling anybody, Cricket.

151
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:58,433
Clearly, the two of you have
strong feelings for each other...

152
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,335
and you're letting that get in the
way of a good business deal here.

153
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:04,101
Look, Cricket, for the love
of God, help us out here, man.

154
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,665
I am not...

155
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:07,734
I tell you what. I'll let
you stay at Dee's place.

156
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,679
No.
Till you're back up on your feet.

157
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:13,239
Dee's place? Yeah. You
two alone, together.

158
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:15,342
One thing could lead to
another. You never know.

159
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,286
You think she still likes me?

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,089
Yeah.

161
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,562
I wasn't sure. I know we
have sort of a sexual tension.

162
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:30,429
No, no, no. You guys got
your own thing going on.

163
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:34,640
I gotta take a cut now,
Cricket. We're working together.

164
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:42,539
Jesus Christ, Frank. I can't
believe you had that thing made.

165
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:45,243
Every pimp has a chalice.
This one is the shit.

166
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:47,581
Great. How much money
did you drop on that?

167
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,314
A lot.

168
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,015
You spend a shitload of money on a chalice
you're just gonna eat cereal out of...

169
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,058
but you won't bail us
out by paying the mob?

170
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,526
By the way, your Jane
is sitting over there.

171
00:07:56,595 --> 00:08:00,087
Aw, you gotta be kid... Dude,
she's, like, a hundred years old.

172
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,533
Sixty-eight tops. That's
still extremely old.

173
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,433
Well, I'm not kissing that.

174
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:08,439
You don't have to kiss her. We
can make that one of your rules.

175
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,407
This time, nothing with the ass.

176
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,376
That got really weird last time.

177
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:15,778
What are you talkin' about? You didn't
set up that ass play on the last one?

178
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:18,715
No. I never set up any ass play.

179
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:22,382
All right. Well.

180
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:27,188
I wanna set up a doctor's appointment
anyway just to be... just to be safe.

181
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,921
All right. Do that.
All right. Here we go.

182
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,965
Hypothetically speaking here...

183
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,866
do you think you could teach a horse
to sit on a barstool and drink beer?

184
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:40,963
I don't know. Maybe. Would you hypothetically
pay really good money to see that?

185
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,975
Is this about bringing a horse back
to the bar? That is completely insane.

186
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:45,977
I'm askin' hypothetical questions here.

187
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:49,014
I'm sorry. I'm a little preoccupied with
worrying about being killed by the mob...

188
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:51,413
because a homeless priest ran off
with all of our drugs. Sure. Sure.

189
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:56,947
Who is it?
It's Matt.

190
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:58,956
Who?
Matthew Mara.

191
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:02,255
It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety
Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket.

192
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,057
Hey! Come on in, man.
Hey!

193
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,256
Come in. Oh! Yeah!

194
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,266
Where should I put this?
Why does he have that?

195
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:11,360
Why does he have his stuff? Charlie
said I could move... It's not important.

196
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,371
Look at this place.

197
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:16,602
It's exactly as I imagined
it would be. What is?

198
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:19,337
Cricks? How'd you do
with our drugs, man?

199
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,470
Oh. Uh, I sold 'em. Here.

200
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,777
Hey, is there a dream
catcher above your bed?

201
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:26,409
Shit, shit, shit! Holy
shit! Look at all that money.

202
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,715
That is a huge wad of money. This is
more money than we make at the bar.

203
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,085
I have never seen this much
money in one spot. Oh, my God.

204
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,647
I guess we can pay the mob back.
We can definitely pay them back.

205
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,455
That's good.
But we have another day.

206
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:38,622
We have a whole day. We have 24
whole hours to go. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

207
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:40,528
He flipped this in what?
No time really.

208
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:43,227
He flipped it so fast, Charlie.
Let's think a little bit for a second.

209
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:45,600
We could flip another batch.
We could pay the mob back.

210
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,764
We could have money
left over for ourselves.

211
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,501
Maybe a little coke.
Yeah, more coke.

212
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,770
I can get a horse. You're not
gonna get a horse, Charlie.

213
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,505
We can have some coke
then. She likes Swiss!

214
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,809
I knew it!
I pictured Swiss.

215
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:59,146
Hey, uh, Cricket.
Cricket, buddy.

216
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:01,812
Can I talk to you for a second?

217
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:05,152
Look, uh, you did
such a fantastic job...

218
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:08,887
that we're gonna need you to go
back out there and do it again.

219
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,488
But you guys said it was a onetime
thing. We say things all day.

220
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:14,658
We say words all the time.
We said so many things.

221
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:18,430
I was thinking maybe I'd curl up on that
bed of Dee's and I'd sleep with the bear.

222
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:21,029
Now's not a good time for
that, man. I'm so tired.

223
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:22,835
Are you tired?
I'm just so tired.

224
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,899
Check it out. I got the
thing for you right here.

225
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:28,378
Where'd you get that? Every
good dealer keeps a head stash.

226
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,176
No.
Dip your finger in there.

227
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,581
Look, Cricket. I got
the thing for you here.

228
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,482
I can't.
Let's speed you up.

229
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:37,215
And then you'll wanna
get back out there.

230
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:39,587
Oh. Aah. Yeah.

231
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:41,592
Oh.
Shh.

232
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:53,037
Where am I having dinner
tonight, Frank?

233
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,073
I'm kind of in the
mood for Asian fusion.

234
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,133
No more dinners. We're going
straight to bangin' from now on.

235
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:01,179
Check this out.

236
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:04,773
Jesus Christ, man.
What, you got a problem?

237
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,580
Yeah. This makes me seem
like a whore. You are a whore.

238
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,382
I'm not a whore.

239
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,423
I'm a handsome companion who goes
to nice dinners with fancy women...

240
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,424
and who has rules
about what he'll do.

241
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,892
What happened to the rules, Frank?
You can still have your rules.

242
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:20,057
It says right here... "No
Rules. " Don't be so uptight.

243
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:22,692
I'm walkin' from this...
What the hell, dude?

244
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:26,295
I'm knocking some sense into
you, Dennis. This is all you got.

245
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:28,863
Dude, why do you keep hitting me?

246
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:32,138
Don't talk back to me!
Okay. Sorry.

247
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:35,840
Look, I'm gonna get you out of this.

248
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:38,109
It's you and me against the world.

249
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:40,947
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

250
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,353
You promise?
I promise.

251
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:47,756
And, hey, I don't wanna
hit you, baby.

252
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:50,852
So please don't make me, okay?

253
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,863
You're my one and only.

254
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,195
You gotta do right by me, okay?

255
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,397
Okay.

256
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:01,734
Come on, Cricket. Where is he,
Charlie? Why do we trust him?

257
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,536
He came through for us
once. He'll do it again.

258
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,338
This is empty.
Get rid of that.

259
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:07,936
You know what, this is his
whole plan. It's not a plan.

260
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,038
Yeah. He convinced us
that he was on our side.

261
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:12,106
Now he's gonna stab us in
the back. I don't think so.

262
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:13,913
What's with the pants?

263
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,920
These things? These are horse-riding
pants. You can't get a horse.

264
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:17,717
Why not?
Because it's crazy.

265
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,384
Is it any crazier than having
a dog that bites or sheds?

266
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,859
Or a cat that poops in a
box while it's biting you?

267
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:25,260
While it's biting you?
Oh! You guys!

268
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,855
Cricket! There you are! What are
you doing? Cricket! There you are!

269
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,662
I'm workin' on my moves.
What moves?

270
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:31,532
For my musical.
I'm writing a musical.

271
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:34,766
It's about life on the streets. Archangel
has to live on the streets and fight crime.

272
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,831
What?
That's great. Where are our drugs?

273
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:39,503
I sold the drugs.
Good. Give us the money.

274
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:42,604
Spent the money on these sweetass
kettledrums. Look at these.

275
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,205
Those are trash cans.
Trash cans, Cricket!

276
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:47,184
These are trash cans? Then
why do they sound like this?

277
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:51,950
You "sold" our drug
money on two garbage cans?

278
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:54,686
No. No, no, no, no.
I did some too.

279
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,786
We can see that! Is there any
left? Can we have what's left?

280
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,024
There is some left. You
guys are yelling like crazy.

281
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,124
I can't compute.
Don't do all of it.

282
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,362
I still gotta write the seventh
act. It's kinda all up here.

283
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:05,960
Come on back to the bar.
Let's go.

284
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,268
I'm not going anywhere without these
kettledrums. Bring your trash cans.

285
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,830
Yeah, don't forget the trash cans.

286
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,739
I'm bringing the trash cans.

287
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,869
Watch the crack addicts
though. They will cut you.

288
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,948
You understand? It's
$200 for the first hour...

289
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,247
and a hundred and fifty
every hour after that.

290
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,153
Unless you want him to
act like he's enjoying it.

291
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:26,589
Then it's a little extra. Eh?

292
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:29,727
All right.

293
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,997
I need... I need you
Make it sexy.

294
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:39,436
I need... I need you

295
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:42,440
You like ass play? He'll
do anything with the ass.

296
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:46,000
I never said...
I wasn't gonna tell...

297
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:56,614
Don Sal?
Yeah. What?

298
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:59,680
Forgive me for speaking
out of line here, but...

299
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:03,387
I don't think I'm being properly
utilized within the organization.

300
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:05,794
I've tried to be eager
and work with a smile...

301
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:08,731
but I'm not making
any forward progress.

302
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:11,292
Aren't you the janitor?
It's not important, Don Sal.

303
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,361
What is important is that
I get out on those streets...

304
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,201
and start doing some gangster shit.

305
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:17,333
There's gotta be a union
boss I can put the squeeze on.

306
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,400
Or a truck I can hijack, right?

307
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,915
How would you like to
do me a personal favor?

308
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,680
Sounds shady. I'm in.
Good.

309
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:30,244
I need you to go over to my house...

310
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:32,882
and take care of my wife.

311
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,926
You mean, like, rub her out?

312
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:36,483
No.
Oh.

313
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:39,463
You want me to bang her? I'm sorry.
No!

314
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:42,762
What the hell is wrong with you? Why
would you say that? Communication problem.

315
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:45,303
What I need you to do
is just go over there.

316
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,669
Like a protection thing.
Yeah. It's somethin' like that.

317
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,268
Okay. I mean, you don't mind
gettin' your hands dirty, do you?

318
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,973
Absolutely not.
Good.

319
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,974
Goddamn mafia!

320
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:04,482
Two hearts that beat as one

321
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:07,024
Like that? Huh?
Get what you want?

322
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:08,582
Just keep dancing, whore.

323
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,992
Two hearts that beat as one

324
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,929
Dennis?

325
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:20,001
We gotta talk. Now.

326
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:22,939
What the hell you doin' here?
I'm working. What are you doing?

327
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:25,442
You cannot seriously be thinking
about banging this old lady.

328
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,774
No, Mac, you have to separate
yourself from the way they look.

329
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,872
Frank says that the only thing
that matters in this game is cash.

330
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:33,713
What did Frank do to you?
Frank takes care of me.

331
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,845
You don't understand the nature
of our relationship. What?

332
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:40,187
Hey! Hey! You! Out! This
is our turf. Get out.

333
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,387
Frank, he cannot bang this
woman. It's the mob boss's wife.

334
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:45,157
What do you think she's gonna do...

335
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,164
call her husband and say
she's banging a whore?

336
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,166
Dennis, up those stairs.

337
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:50,963
Dennis, don't do it.
He's got you brainwashed.

338
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,800
Go!
Dennis! Stay!

339
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:58,468
Go! Get up there! Now!
Stay! Stay! Stay!

340
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,841
You're gonna get us
killed! Stop! Stop! Stop!

341
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,177
Please stop hitting me so
I can think for a second.

342
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:06,012
You see? This is bad. You got
him thinking for himself again.

343
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:09,383
What the hell are you doing,
whore? Get back upstairs.

344
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,388
No.

345
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:14,016
Get your ass back in the bedroom.

346
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:16,026
I'm outta here.

347
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,857
What about you, Pussy Hands?

348
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:23,424
Me? Oh, no. I would never
sleep with you. You're gross.

349
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:29,006
Last taste. Last taste.
One more. That's it.

350
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:30,939
Last one. That's it because
we're almost out of it.

351
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,943
We can't do this.
Mm-hmm.

352
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:34,945
All right. Okay.
Here's the plan.

353
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:38,779
I'm gonna cut it with flour. I don't
think the mob's gonna know the difference.

354
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,047
You sure that's gonna work? People do it
all the time. I think this will trick 'em.

355
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:49,217
That's too much, huh?
That's too much flour.

356
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:51,387
Let me think.
They're gonna kill us!

357
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:53,397
We're dead!
Here's what we're gonna do.

358
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,456
We're dead 'cause of the
flour. We're outta here.

359
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,798
Where we going? We're gonna skip town.
We're gonna go up to the mountains.

360
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:59,894
We can't tell anybody. We just
gotta go. We'll go to the mountains.

361
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,566
We gotta get outta here.
We're gonna have a fresh start.

362
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,472
We'll start over.
I like that.

363
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:08,206
It's just gonna be you and
me and Peter Nincompoop.

364
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:11,942
Who's Peter Nincompoop?

365
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:16,545
Huh? Huh? Oh, my God.
How did that get here?

366
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:19,089
How did that get here? I rode
it here. What do you think?

367
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,489
Hop on. We're outta here.
I'm not hopping on there.

368
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,960
We can't get outta here on that.
We need a car. It's too obvious.

369
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,395
It is?
People will see... us and it.

370
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,797
We gotta get out in a car.
All right.

371
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,028
You got a better chance
without us, don't you, buddy?

372
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:34,402
Okay. You know what.
Get outta here. Hah!

373
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:38,170
Go, Peter Nincompoop!
I miss you already!

374
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:42,079
I love you, Peter Nincompoop.

375
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:44,081
Mmm. Let's go.

376
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,650
Okay, okay.
What are you doin'?

377
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,655
I'm gonna try and stay sharp
here. That's mostly flour.

378
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,588
But if we do enough of it,
it should still work, right?

379
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,683
Well, then, let's do
a lot of it. Let's go!

380
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:59,230
That's a pop. That's
a pop. That's a pop.

381
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:01,322
Make it sexy.
It has to be sexy.

382
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,334
Otherwise, you don't eat. Okay?

383
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:05,734
Frank, put the gun away.
Oh, no.

384
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,102
I'm goin' out,
I'm goin' guns blazing.

385
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:11,438
Rise up
Gonna get higher and higher

386
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,842
Whoo!
Rickety Cricket.

387
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:15,846
Hey!
Lookin' good, bro.

388
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,643
Thanks, man. I'm almost done.

389
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:21,812
Welcome back to the bar. Good afternoon.

390
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,651
How you guys doin'? We're
very good. Things are fine.

391
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,953
You guys look like you're
doin' really well. Absolutely.

392
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,686
Check it out.
We got all the cocaine.

393
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,388
Didn't get the cash. Got the cocaine.
We might have bigger problems.

394
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:34,125
We just pissed off the mob boss's wife
because me and Dennis wouldn't bang her.

395
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:37,066
We just need to be
prepared for anything.

396
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:39,296
Okay. Then I tell you
what. I will get my gun.

397
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,737
Whoa. When'd you get a
gun? I went back to Bingo.

398
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,640
Wow. I thought we said no guns
though. That was before all the blow.

399
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,643
You should've told me, because I'm been
carrying this thing around the entire time.

400
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:50,010
Guys, guys, guys!
No guns! No guns!

401
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:53,848
I'm gonna put this in my sock. And if the
shit goes down, I'll pretend I'm tying my shoe.

402
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,114
And I'll reach for some cigarettes.

403
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:58,656
And when I ask for a
light, we come out blastin'!

404
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,657
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
No! No!

405
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,590
We are not gonna come out blasting!

406
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,652
Jesus Christ! What is
wrong with you people?

407
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:08,825
Look, we can still get through
this if we just calm down.

408
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,664
Oh! These guys.

409
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,499
Hey. Ho.

410
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:16,439
Hiya.
All right. It's Friday.

411
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,442
Youse guys got somethin' for me?

412
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,172
Has anybody got a light?

413
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:24,374
Right here.

414
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:27,009
Don't move!
Put the guns down!

415
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,280
I got the 25 G's. I got
the money, so it's all good.

416
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,015
Eh?
There you go.

417
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,215
Get outta here.
Go on.

418
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,588
Count It.
Got it, boss.

419
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,093
Where'd you get the money?
I sold Frank's pimp chalice.

420
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:38,857
What?
That's right, you son of a bitch.

421
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,593
Thanks for bailing us out.
Just like always. Goddamn it.

422
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,534
It's all here, boss.
Okay. Well, that was close.

423
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:47,765
Yeah, it seemed close. It got a
little stressful. A little tense.

424
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,307
"Tense" is an excellent
word for what happened.

425
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,138
It was nice doin'
business with you guys.

426
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,144
Hopefully, I'll never
have to see you again.

427
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:57,113
All righty. Sounds
good. Sounds very good.

428
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,480
You guys, you gotta make
it sexy... hips and nips.

429
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,280
Otherwise, I'm not eatin'.

430
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:03,844
Yeah.

431
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:05,947
What?
Who?

432
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,151
You. Come here. Yeah?

433
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:09,989
Can you do me a favor?
Sure.

434
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,086
Explain to me why my
wife is calling me...

435
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:15,895
telling me that one of Pussy Hands's
friends tried to force himself on her.

436
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,902
Oh! Oh!
This guy?

437
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,939
Oh! Oh! That's crazy!

438
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,100
Enough with the "Oh's"!
I think that's insane.

439
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:26,736
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

440
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,745
Then I assume it was you, pinhead.

441
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,644
No! It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!

442
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,616
Then who was it?
