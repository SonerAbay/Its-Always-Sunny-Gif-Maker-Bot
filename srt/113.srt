2
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,108
My apartment is not a spa.

3
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:44,776
Dennis and I are gonna take a soak.

4
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,342
You and Dennis are going to bathe together?

5
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:49,912
It's that Turkish bath thing.
What are you worried about?

6
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm not worried about anything...

7
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,583
but my apartment is not
a Turkish bath, okay?

8
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,060
Well, Dee, this is
Dennis's apartment now too.

9
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:58,029
No. No, goddamn it, it's not, all right?

10
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,464
Mac and Dennis do not live here.

11
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:09,000
- What the hell is this?
- One more!

12
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,303
Stop!

13
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,743
- Hey!
- Good set, boys!

14
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,246
What are you doing?

15
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,906
Oh, Dee, this is Jojo...

16
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,609
- Tiny, Charlie you know.
- I don't care.

17
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,948
Together, we are Ass Kickers United.

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,512
You guys, come on, please. I don't want you
doing your weird routines in here!

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,650
It's not a routine, Dee,
and there is nothing weird about this, okay?

20
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,320
Ass Kickers United is a way of life...

21
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,864
based on the life-improvement
teachings of the Master.

22
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,422
What kind of cult shit is that?

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,990
No, no, it's not a cult, Frank.

24
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,696
The Master is the only
human to ever achieve enlightenment...

25
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,261
through the way of the warrior.

26
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,863
Snap, two, three.

27
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,273
One, two, seven, three, nine.

28
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,265
Come on. Goddamn it!

29
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:13,329
Frank, I can't get this Fight
Milk out of the goddamn couch!

30
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,395
Oh! Shit!

31
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,339
It burned a hole in the cushion!

32
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,570
That's probably the crotein.

33
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,169
Don't get that on your skin!

34
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:23,182
Hey-oh! Frank! Frank,
sorry I'm late, man, but, uh, good news.

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,877
I brought checkers. Oh, what's up, Dee?

36
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:28,079
I got dominoes, and what the hell is going
on? Your place looks like shit.

37
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,145
- What happened?
- Yeah, it does. I'll tell you what happened.

38
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,691
Mac and his goddamn
Ass Blasters Incorporated...

39
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,556
were in here jerking around all day.

40
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,825
Mac, Charlie and a bunch
of goons started a queer club.

41
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,388
- Hmm.
- They got a newsletter.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,335
Oh, shit. "Ass Kickers United."

43
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:45,166
- Oh, my God.
- What?

44
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:49,174
- Dee, Mac didn't start this club. I did.
- What are you talking about?

45
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:52,507
Yeah. I, uh... I just made this shit up
about Ass Kickers United...

46
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,843
to get Mac to stop eating my Thin Mints.

47
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,611
- Huh?
- You know how Mac is all irritating and shit?

48
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,276
- Of course.
- The worst!

49
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,877
Right. He was doing all this irritating shit
and he was driving me crazy.

50
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,219
Worst of all, he was eating
all my Thin Mint cookies...

51
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,156
and, so, you know, playing
on Mac's physical insecurities...

52
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:08,456
I decided I would get
in his head a little bit.

53
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:10,257
So I created this Master character,
all right?

54
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,820
I typed up this newsletter...

55
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:14,731
which was mostly about fitness
and, like, just kicking ass...

56
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,099
at life in general, just kind
of speaking Mac's language.

57
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,469
But mostly, I was speaking of the dangers of
consuming too many Thin Mint cookies.

58
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,303
And I'll tell you, it worked like a charm...

59
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,967
'cause he stopped eating
Thin Mints almost immediately.

60
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:27,639
- That... is extremely impressive.
- Oh.

61
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,239
Dennis, I missed most of that last part.
Run it by me again.

62
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,615
Frank, I just spoke for five straight
minutes. I'm not doing it again.

63
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,984
- Dennis started a cult.
- No, I didn't start a cult.

64
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,148
Sure sounds like a cult.
Hey, I got a great idea.

65
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:39,384
Why don't you type up another newsletter...

66
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,120
and tell Mac and his dum-dum friends...

67
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,821
to go and fix up your apartment, right?

68
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,830
That way, you guys can get out of my place.

69
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,388
Or maybe get some broads involved.

70
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,435
Cults are great for attracting new age tail.

71
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,494
Guys, you can't go straight to fixing
apartments and getting young, new age tail.

72
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,563
You can't do that.
That takes years of brainwashing.

73
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,905
Here's the problem. If you don't do that
and write the newsletter...

74
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:59,138
and fix up the apartment,
then I'm gonna rat you out.

75
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,907
- Come on.
- I'm gonna have to. You know why?

76
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,846
I'm up to here. I've had a very bad day!

77
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,406
I'm at the end of my rope...

78
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,247
- Okay, Dee, calm down.
- If I'm being honest.

79
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,549
All right, look, I'll test
the waters a little bit, okay?

80
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,249
See if we can get 'em there slowly.

81
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:13,759
Maybe you can get 'em
to eat a shit sandwich. That would be fun.

82
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,954
Why the hell would I... What?
No, this isn't about fun.

83
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,862
This is about...
It's about Thin Mints, goddamn it! Right?

84
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:22,026
And the reason I'm so good
at this is because I take it seriously.

85
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,297
Now, just watch and learn.

86
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,465
Listen up!

87
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,339
According to the Master, guys...

88
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,106
we're not getting enough vitamin D.

89
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,670
So these stickers harness
the power of the sun...

90
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:39,446
and deliver it directly to our bodies, okay?

91
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,181
And, apparently, guys,
there's another exercise.

92
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:43,916
Yes, sensei!

93
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,685
All right, now, they're
called hammer jerks...

94
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,458
and it's sort of like
a hammer, then you bend.

95
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,090
- Then you snap, then you jerk.
- Ow.

96
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,656
- Then a hammer.
- Hammer!

97
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:55,723
- Now bend!
- Bend.

98
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:56,928
- Snap.
- Damn it.

99
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:57,992
- Jerk.
- Oh, yeah.

100
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,835
Hammer, bend, snap...

101
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:01,896
jerk.

102
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,067
Hammer...

103
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:04,872
I can't believe they went
for the sticker thing.

104
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:06,411
Thank you. Thank you.

105
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,969
Okay, time to dial it up a notch.

106
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,073
Let's put 'em to work
and get 'em to your apartment.

107
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,141
We can't just dive into that shit.
We talked about this.

108
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,708
It's a slow burn.

109
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,550
They're wearing stickers on their heads.
They're there.

110
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,112
Look, look, look, stop.

111
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,818
You guys are going crazy.
You're gonna blow the Thin Mint thing.

112
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,123
Will you just trust me? I got this.

113
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,753
I am the Master.

114
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,798
I'm gonna get you what you want.

115
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,265
You just got to let me do my thing.

116
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,393
- That sounds... That sounds good.
- Mm, yeah, okay.

117
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,438
- You gonna goddamn blow this for me?
- No.

118
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,996
- You gonna blow the Thin Mint thing?
- No.

119
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,179
- <i>"The Master saith."</i>
- Yeah.

120
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:47,743
"Kicking ass in life is all about drywall."

121
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,345
And pussy. Put "pussy."

122
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:50,912
Goddamn, Frank, don't say "pussy."

123
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,049
- It's disgusting. I'm not putting it.
- Mmm.

124
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:56,027
"To be a total badass...

125
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,429
- you must learn carpentry.
- Mmm.

126
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:04,232
Fixing apartments is what you must do."

127
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,238
And buy Wolf Cola.

128
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:07,967
Let's make some coin.

129
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,531
Okay.

130
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:14,478
"And buy Wolf Cola, the only
cola for true refreshment."

131
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:15,605
That's good.

132
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,650
- "Splash into the beast."
- Mm-hmm, that's great.

133
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:20,584
I know it is. Cool it with the jerky, will
you? You're driving me nuts.

134
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,917
- Now, put-put "bring pussy."
- Goddamn it. All right, fine.

135
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:26,083
- Just put it.
- Hey, listen! This is what I'll do.

136
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,686
"Ladies are now mandatory.

137
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:35,258
Each of you dick-bags must
recruit at least one woman."

138
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:36,825
Should we put anything else?

139
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,497
- Make 'em eat a shit sandwich.
- What is it with you?

140
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,563
Do you really want to see
somebody take a roll...

141
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,666
and stick doody in it
and put it in their mouth?

142
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,677
- God! You are so gross.
- Nah.

143
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:49,042
Okay, so, how much for the Wolf Colas?

144
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,413
- Five bucks apiece.
- Okay, great. Ma, how many you want?

145
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:52,974
I'll take three.

146
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,418
Okay. And Mrs. Mac?

147
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,012
- Sh-She'll have one.
- Huh?

148
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,456
One. Any more caffeine
than that, and she will not stop talking.

149
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:02,359
Really? Oh, kind of want to see that.

150
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,089
Charlie, can I talk to you for a second?

151
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:08,294
- Yeah. What's up?
- Um, does all this seem kind of strange to you?

152
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:10,529
Huh? Uh... Oh! You mean the Wolf Cola thing?

153
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,093
Yeah. I was wondering.

154
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:14,936
Like, how does the Master
know about Wolf Cola?

155
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,703
Oh, he's an aficionado of all beverages.

156
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,266
He's gonna know the finest of colas.

157
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,006
Oh, oh. You mean the carpentry thing. Yeah.

158
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,743
No. Throughout history,
uh, Ass Kickers have always known carpentry.

159
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,547
- Jesus Christ, Harrison Ford.
- Right, okay.

160
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:29,782
- Then what are you talking about?
- The women. The women, dude.

161
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:33,348
This is supposed to be a men's club, you
know? Who wants that around?

162
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,291
Oh. Uh...

163
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,226
I don't know. I'm kind of cool with it.

164
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,323
Also, I don't ever remember
anything in the newsletters about no women.

165
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,233
It could not have been more clear...
no women, no gays.

166
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:46,568
I don't ever remember you
reading anything about that.

167
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,300
It was implied, okay?

168
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:53,539
Look, in these kind of texts,
you need to be able to in... infer what's be...

169
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,137
Look, I'll explain it to you later.

170
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,513
I think I'm just gonna...
I need some time off.

171
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,781
Whoa. Hey, man, you can't take a day off
from kicking ass, okay?

172
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,482
Look, an Ass Kicker
must be present every day.

173
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:05,183
An Ass Kicker must do the exercises.

174
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,748
An Ass Kicker must avoid Thin Mints.

175
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,090
I know the rules, okay? I don't need to...

176
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:11,528
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go. I'm just gonna go.

177
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:14,158
- You're just gonna go?
- I mean...

178
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,565
I mean...

179
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:19,162
Okay, I'm taking the men with me,
and Frank's got the women.

180
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,706
Oh, cool. Are you an Ass Kicker now?

181
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,866
- I'm an Ass Kicker now.
- Sweet. Who signed you up?

182
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,432
- The dumb one.
- Oh, Tiny?

183
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,910
No, no, no. The one eating
paint chips off the wall.

184
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,013
These taste like paint.

185
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,743
Uh, yeah, those are paint chips there, pal.

186
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,182
- These are?
- Yeah.

187
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,117
- Oh, they're delicious.
- Yeah, that's the good paint.

188
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,677
Let's go.

189
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,724
All right, let's go. Hey, we're gonna, uh,
go swing some hammers.

190
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,925
Oh, you guys, it's so great
that you do construction.

191
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,830
I mean, this is just gonna be easy...

192
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:50,597
just slap a couple coats of paint around,
maybe a couple of new doors.

193
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,695
- You're gonna be in and out in a few hours.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:54,700
Ha... Oh!

195
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,004
Wow! Shit.

196
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:01,911
- No wall! That's pretty awesome.
- Okay, boys, let's get to work.

197
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,211
- Yeah.
- Look, I do construction for a living.

198
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:07,811
I mean, I thought Ass Kickers was just some
sort of fun workout club, you know, like...

199
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,377
- CrossFit.
- CrossFit.

200
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,980
Hey, man, you don't want to take
this seriously?

201
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:14,891
Hey, that's fine. Why
don't you give me those stickers back then?

202
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,452
Uh, no, I'm coming down
with a cold and I need mine.

203
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,395
Did you do, like, your deer antler spray?

204
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,057
Some. But I'm running lower.

205
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,398
Have some of mine. Here.

206
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,664
All right, you know what?
I overreacted, boys. I overreacted.

207
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,968
I snapped at you,
and the Master wouldn't like that.

208
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,442
And I'm sorry. I think
maybe this is my mission and my calling.

209
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:35,072
So why don't you guys find some other
mission and I'll handle this one, okay?

210
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,638
- Thanks, Charlie.
- All right, cool.

211
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,206
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

212
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,081
- Goddamn it, Charlie.
- It's fine.

213
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:42,951
You know, the guys have been
working their asses off. I got this. Look.

214
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,683
Dee, the Master says fix it?

215
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,816
I'm gonna fix it.

216
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:53,933
Frank, is that you?
Missed you in there, pal.

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,265
Still pretty steamy though
if you want to hop in and...

218
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:00,329
- What the hell's this?
- Just watching a little TV.

219
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:03,933
- Are those Thin Mints?
- Oh, yeah, big-time, dude. I love these things.

220
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,138
I notice, uh, you're
looking a little out of shape there, bud.

221
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,680
I am?

222
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,477
Yeah. Yeah, and it's a shame too...

223
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,950
because you've been looking
so great lately. So sexy.

224
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,853
- I was?
- Yeah, so to see this is just disappointing.

225
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,550
To me, but, you know...

226
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,524
- This disappoints you?
- Yeah.

227
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,255
What are you doing? You taking a day off
or something? Is that okay?

228
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,058
I'm sure the Master allows
for that though, right?

229
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,565
- Well, I'm not really sure about that.
- Oh, you're not sure, yeah.

230
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,034
Did the Master not make that crystal goddamn
clear in all those newsletters?

231
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,902
- Was that not clear?
- I-I didn't read into it like that.

232
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,533
Wow, wow. I mean, I haven't read
the things, but I've just...

233
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,167
You guys have been telling me.

234
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,678
Thin Mints, from what I understand...
that was a whole thing.

235
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,079
- I think that was, like, rule number...
- Oh, shit.

236
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,639
I... Yeah. I-I...

237
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,049
I-I may have... I messed up a little bit.

238
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,353
I hope he doesn't notice the fat that I'm
noticing sort of accumulated all over.

239
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,723
But maybe he won't notice.
I noticed, but maybe he won't.

240
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:57,092
- Y-You don't think he would, or...
- No, I think he will.

241
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:59,427
Uh, do you mind if I use the computer?

242
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:02,832
I'm just gonna grab this and take it over
here for a little bit, okay?

243
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:03,891
Mmm.

244
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,165
And snap it back!

245
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:13,371
Bend and snap.

246
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:14,936
How's that neck, Cindy? Everything good?

247
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,606
How are the muscles? You feeling okay?

248
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,515
- You may want to soak 'em a little bit.
- Actually, I feel great.

249
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:23,248
- Oh, you feel great.
- Frank, I'm in tremendous pain.

250
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,688
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her.

251
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,225
I can't breathe.

252
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,421
Oh, she needs a cigarette break.
Could we stop, please?

253
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,464
I don't care what she needs.

254
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,022
I'm not talking to you.

255
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,466
Do whatever you want.
I'm trying to hurt <i>her.</i>

256
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,094
What?

257
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,934
Uh, well, it's... it... I'm...

258
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,804
You have to tear the fascial tissues...

259
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,708
in order to tone the muscles properly.

260
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:47,302
- Oh.
- According to the Master.

261
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,406
- Okay.
- So you bend and you snap.

262
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:51,973
But snap your head back.

263
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,712
Bend. You see it?

264
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,413
- Frank?
- And snap!

265
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:58,980
- Frank, Frank, Frank. We need to talk.
- Yo, Cindy, you keep working.

266
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:00,787
- Go ahead. Snap it.
- Okay, you got it.

267
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,920
Hey, listen. We gotta make
a bit of an adjustment.

268
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,328
Tiny and Jojo, they don't
want to do the construction...

269
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,493
so I was looking into what cults do
to force people into labor...

270
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:13,027
when the mind tricks don't work, and one of
them was a personality test, right?

271
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:16,837
You basically just get a bunch of dirt on
people and you hold it over their heads.

272
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,399
So, blackmail.

273
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:19,775
Yeah.

274
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,083
So this is a basic personality test.

275
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,813
It's really simple.

276
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:32,187
It just measures the amount
of... guilt stressors that you're feeling.

277
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,250
You know, I took it,
and I just... It's changed my life.

278
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,818
What are guilt stressors?

279
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,488
Yeah, Dee, what... what are guilt stressors?

280
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,293
Oh, great question. Great question.

281
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:42,766
Apparently,
secrets and lies lead to guilt stressors...

282
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,325
and that's not good, you guys.

283
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,871
You know why?
It impedes muscle development.

284
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,463
- I have read that.
- Oh, really?

285
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,566
- Well, it's science. It's just basic science.
- Oh, shit.

286
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,167
It does sound like good science.

287
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:55,009
You guys just hang on to that machine and
talk about all your regrets.

288
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,379
And what are regrets again?

289
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,783
Y-You just talk about things you feel
really guilty about.

290
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,617
- Oh.
- Oh, okay. Uh, okay.

291
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,487
- Do you want to...
- I'll go. Dee, where do my feet go?

292
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,754
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
- Okay, uh...

293
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,727
I ate a baby toad once. I'm not proud of it.

294
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,698
Uh, just kind of happened.

295
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,292
- It pains me to think about how scared
and confused it was... - Mm-hmm.

296
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,860
And wondering, "Why am I not home...

297
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:21,998
and why am I in some sort
of acid pond that's burning my skin?"

298
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,338
What if it was looking for its mother?
It was a baby.

299
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,073
I got an idea. How about we let one of these
guys, uh, give it a shot.

300
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:29,739
- I'll go.
- I don't feel better, but all right.

301
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:31,339
- Where do my feet go?
- Dee, his feet?

302
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,975
- It doesn't make a goddamn difference.
- Okay.

303
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,716
- I ate a toad too.
- Oh, God.

304
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:37,813
- Really?
- I did.

305
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,687
- Do it again, like that?
- Yeah, do it again.

306
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,249
- Go ahead.
- Whoo!

307
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,817
Oh, I feel the burn.

308
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,090
Yeah, how's...
how's the neck feeling? How's the neck?

309
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,654
You know, it's not bad.

310
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:49,428
- It's actually a little tight.
- It's a little tight.

311
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:52,062
Well, how about
if we hop in the healing pool.

312
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,038
- Okay.
- I'll give you some touch therapy...

313
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,370
so you don't seem too weak for the Master.

314
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:57,670
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

315
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,904
- I don't suppose that could hurt.
- No, that won't hurt.

316
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,172
Oh, shit.

317
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,241
Oh, hi.

318
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,549
The water's wonderful.

319
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,886
- When did you get in here?
- You don't mind that we came in first, do you?

320
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,756
- There's plenty of room.
- No, how long are you gonna be?

321
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,317
Well...

322
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:20,422
- Oh, God.
- She thinks she has a tear in her uterine wall...

323
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,433
so it might be a while.

324
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,560
All right. L-Let's go.

325
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,868
Oh, God.

326
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:30,102
I'm gonna go do a few sets of kettle pops
while I run the block a few times.

327
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,905
- Yeah.
- Don't want to disappoint the Master.

328
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:35,209
- You want to come?
- Go... You go get yourself good and banged up.

329
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:36,976
- Okay!
- Oh, yeah.

330
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,313
Guys, guys, guys,
there's been a mistake, a terrible mistake.

331
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,979
I got a new newsletter from the Master.

332
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:44,454
There's gonna be no more women,
no more Wolf Cola...

333
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,423
and no more carpentry in Ass Kickers United.

334
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:47,982
This has all been a test...

335
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,790
designed by the Master to figure out who
the true believers are.

336
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:54,993
I passed, you failed,
and that's why I'm going to level two.

337
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,737
Oh, also, uh, Dennis will
be level two as well...

338
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,294
but he'll be directly under me.

339
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:01,863
Wh-What? Where'd you get that from?

340
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,409
- It was implied in the newsletter.
- No.

341
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:07,469
How is Dennis in level two?
Or an Ass Kicker, for that matter?

342
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,844
- Oh, he bought in.
- He... bought in?

343
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,678
Come on, Ass Kickers,
let's get out of here...

344
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,412
- before we're tainted by these
disgusting women. - Mm-hmm.

345
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:17,013
All right. God, crazy. Failed that test.

346
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,455
Go kick some ass, huh? Go kick some ass!

347
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,927
- Hmm. - Thought you could
outmaster the Master, idiots?

348
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,488
So you swayed 'em back.
Uh, whatever. We can do that too.

349
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,056
Dee, you think this is easy?

350
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:32,764
You need years of practice
to even sniff my talent for manipulation.

351
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,932
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a cult that
needs a charismatic leader.

352
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,607
Yeah.

353
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:43,543
Goddamn it, Frank. Goddamn it!

354
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,176
No. No, we cannot let him
get away with this.

355
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:49,517
No, this is about something different now,
something much more important.

356
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:52,716
- Shit sandwich?
- What? Why? What is that? No!

357
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,317
God. No, this is about control now.

358
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,056
This is about control,
and it's about beating Dennis.

359
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,222
Mmm.

360
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,698
I know exactly what we need to do.

361
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,802
Hmm.

362
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,974
Deandra, we're all set.

363
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,070
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,671
- He's out?
- He's lit.

365
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:19,843
I have so much alcohol in here.
I gave him three bottles of Fight Milk.

366
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,409
Whoa. That's a lot.

367
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,318
Okay, you ready? Got your cards?

368
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:24,879
- Okay.
- Okay.

369
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:26,322
Here we go.

370
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,751
Charlie.

371
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,387
Charlie.

372
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,694
- Say it louder.
- Charlie, wake up!

373
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,394
Huh? What's... What's...

374
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,160
What's happening?

375
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,762
It is I...

376
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,674
the Master!

377
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:46,712
- Am I dreaming?
- You're having a vision.

378
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,838
- Am I peeing?
- Uh...

379
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,246
- Is he peeing?
- Just read the card.

380
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:56,054
You and the other Ass Kickers must con...

381
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,612
con...

382
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,282
What's that word?

383
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,292
- Congregate.
- "Congregate"? What does that mean?

384
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,089
It doesn't matter. Just say it.

385
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,857
Congregate.

386
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,194
- What does that mean?
- Oh, God. You know what? Just...

387
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,927
Hey, Charlie, hey.

388
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:12,630
Get all the Ass Kickers together and meet at
Mac and Dennis's apartment, okay?

389
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:15,105
Lord Zolo is gonna get you
on the mother ship.

390
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,698
Lord Zolo?

391
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:20,439
Charlie, you've graduated to the next level.
Congratulations.

392
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:24,040
And your reward is to get
to know all the secrets of the universe.

393
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,913
Yeah, there's just
a few things you have to do.

394
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,479
Okay. I'll do them.

395
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,554
I'm peeing.

396
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,322
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

397
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,424
Okay, you guys...

398
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:43,991
Holy shit!

399
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,003
Whoa! What the hell happened in here?

400
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,232
You like it?
Yeah, well, before Master Rex said...

401
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,865
that we weren't supposed to do carpentry...

402
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,775
I talked to Tiny and Jojo and they got their
construction crew in here.

403
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,643
- There's a wall.
- Oh, you're goddamn right there's a wall.

404
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,409
I'm good. Dennis is gonna shit his pants.

405
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,007
Why? What are you good at?

406
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,574
Good at my...

407
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,450
I'm a good person, and you know what?

408
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:04,455
It's time to... to do the plan...

409
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,013
that the Master laid out, right?

410
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,992
I'm gonna take Tiny in the other room
and make the pods ready.

411
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,926
- Come on, Tiny.
- We got pods?

412
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,623
Of course we got pods.

413
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,724
Lord Zolo's gonna take you guys
on that mother ship with him. You need pods.

414
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,099
- Am I right, Master?
- Do... Do I get a pod?

415
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,695
Okay, guys, guys, guys, we got a...

416
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,638
Uh, wow. Holy shit.

417
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,108
- That's a wall.
- Yeah. This place looks great.

418
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,008
You're goddamn right this place looks great.

419
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's pretty
impressive stuff, Dee, but, uh...

420
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:30,972
it doesn't seal the deal.

421
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,314
I've got an announcement.
I've got some big news here.

422
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,853
The Master texted me while we were
on our way over here.

423
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:37,513
Oh, interesting.

424
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,354
Uh, I wonder how it's possible that the
Master could've texted you...

425
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:42,553
when he's been here with us the whole time.

426
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,528
Rex is the Master?

427
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,394
- That makes so much sense.
- Yep.

428
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,558
Yes. Of course I know that Rex...

429
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,832
is the Master, and of course I would never
question the word of someone so... wise.

430
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:56,306
But I actually got
a text from the Supreme Overlord Master.

431
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,002
And that's Rex's master.

432
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,672
- Oh, shit. - "Oh, shit" is right, you
guys. That's... He's the big guy.

433
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:05,945
He sits right at the tippy-tippy-top, and he
made it very, very clear to me...

434
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:09,385
that all of you are going to need to...

435
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:10,979
commit suicide.

436
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:13,422
Tits! I knew it! The final circle.

437
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,892
Yeah, okay, sure, but hang on a second.

438
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,054
- Can I please talk to you for
just a quick second? - Sure.

439
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,155
Why don't you guys get yourselves lathered
up in lighter fluid...

440
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,700
and, uh, you're gonna get ready
to light yourselves ablaze.

441
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,599
- Thanks for trusting me.
- Yeah, of course.

442
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,936
I did it. I won.
I am the most charismatic leader.

443
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,067
I got Tiny to eat a shit sandwich.

444
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,667
- Ugh!
- Oh!

445
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,269
Goddamn it!

446
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:35,904
I got him to eat a poopy.

447
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,414
You idiot!

448
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,917
I got these guys to think
they were going to another dimension.

449
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,646
- I'm the winner.
- Are you kidding me?

450
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,188
They were gonna light
themselves on fire for me. I'm the winner.

451
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:47,054
- Oh. - Guys, guys, hang on a
second. The winner of what?

452
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,526
The... The Ass Kickers, okay?

453
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:52,462
The winner of the Ass Kickers.
It's mine. It's not theirs.

454
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:55,898
- What? - It's mine. The whole
thing's made up. I made it up.

455
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,597
Master Rex, is this true?

456
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,229
Oh, don't ask Rex. What...

457
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,797
The fire is started.
Thank you so much for trusting me with this.

458
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,035
This is good-bye!

459
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,599
- Goddamn it! No, not again!
- Don't do it!

460
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:08,203
- Whoa!
- Run!

461
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,009
Hey! We'll get you some help, okay?

462
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:11,879
- We'll call the fire department.
- Oh, God.

463
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,578
- Yeah.
- And then we'll go to Dee's.

464
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:16,450
- No, no, no. Can't we go anywhere else?
- No, Dee.

465
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,285
What if the Supreme Overlord
tries to contact us?

466
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,655
- He has to know where we are.
- Yeah, exactly.

467
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,626
All right, well, at least
he's on the mother ship now.

468
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,185
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God! Unbelievable!

469
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,753
Come on, let's go. Get help. Let's go.

470
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:27,355
Good luck, Jojo!

471
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,367
Thank you! Aah!

472
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,500
