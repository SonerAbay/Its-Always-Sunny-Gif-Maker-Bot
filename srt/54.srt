1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,961
[Knocking] [Mac] Dee.
Dee. Dee. Dee.

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,963
Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee.
Sweet Dee. [Dennis] Hey!

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,757
Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee.
Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,300
What?
Hey.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,135
Hey- Oh-
What the hell is this?

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,804
- Oh, yeah.
- [Purring]

7
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,139
- [Dennis] Uh-oh.
- And so it begins.

8
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,433
- Mmm. - What are you talking about?
I got a cat. So what?

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,979
Congratulations, Dee. You've begun your
transformation into crazy cat lady.

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,482
I didn't begin a transformation.
I just- I just got a cat...

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,484
'cause I wanted
something to hang out with.

12
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,820
I don't have, you know,
a roommate or anything,

13
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,197
and I don't really have
anyone to talk to, so I...

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,700
If you listen to yourself, you would realize
you're only strengthening our argument.

15
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,868
What do you want?
We need a big bowl for popcorn.

16
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,787
- Yeah!
- Mac and Dennis movie night!

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,747
Whoosh!
Tuesday night's movie night!

18
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,332
We're doing Predator again.

19
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,167
You guys don't have a bowl?
Um...

20
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,130
We don't have a big one, no.
Not a big enough one for what we need, Dee.

21
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,006
[Clattering] All right!
Be careful! Come on!

22
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,550
These cups suck.
You serious?

23
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,135
Yeah. Oh!
Bingo.

24
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,678
Yeah, you found it.
Nice.

25
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,723
Why did you guys have to both
come over here to get one bowl?

26
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,350
It's more fun if we both come.
I was gonna hold the bowl.

27
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,145
Dennis was gonna stand next to me and
make snide comments. Yeah. That's right.

28
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,063
Oh, you look like a bird.
That's one. Uh- Old.

29
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,649
Pick a new one. You got a new one?
It's an oldie but goodie.

30
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,943
- He comes up with good ones.
- Yeah, no. That was a good one.

31
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,071
I don't understand why you can't make snide
remarks and hold a bowl at the same time though.

32
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,657
It doesn't make sense. You're fixating
too much on the bowl aspect of it.

33
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,784
Put it this way. If the two
of us didn't come together,

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,995
what if one of us were
to get into a jam? Mmm.

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,580
Be silly not to have
the other one there.

36
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,999
Silly? Dennis, that sounds
downright dangerous. Yeah.

37
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,836
See, you'll never get out of a jam because
you got no friends. Well, you're a spinster.

38
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,045
Mm-hmm.
A lonely spinster.

39
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,756
With a cat.

40
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,716
[Both Giggling]
Those are all funny.

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,469
It's funny 'cause I feel like you
guys are two codependent losers...

42
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,053
who are so wrapped up
in each other...

43
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,264
that it's hard for you to see
how pathetic your lives are.

44
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,807
It's like you're
an old married couple.

45
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,310
No, Dee.
We're more like a dynamic duo.

46
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,395
So you don't think that
two 30-year-old men...

47
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,982
who spend every waking moment
together is a little bit pathetic?

48
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,901
Well, we don't spend every
waking moment together.

49
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,778
- What are you, crazy?
- You're right. I'm sorry.

50
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,947
When was the last time you went more
than an hour without seeing each other?

51
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,908
All the time.
Every day.

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,744
- Okay. Without checking in?
- Ch- Checking. That's...

53
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,329
Uh-huh.
He always checks in with me.

54
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,873
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He likes to have
me check in, but it's not like...

55
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,250
Okay.
Enjoy that movie, boners.

56
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,419
[Exhales]

57
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,671
She doesn't know anything
about friendship, dude.

58
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,757
No. How could she?
She doesn't have any friends.

59
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,259
"Old married couple."
That's what she called...

60
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,094
[Both Chuckling]

61
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,428
[Door Opens]

62
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,265
- Hey-oh.
- Yo, where you been?

63
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,892
What do you mean?
I was getting the movie.

64
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,769
Yeah, but you weren't answering
any of my calls.

65
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,230
I've been calling you...
sort of over and over again.

66
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,440
I was having a conversation
with the video store clerk.

67
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,902
Yeah, but I texted you 911, dude.
That means it's an emergency.

68
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,946
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah.

69
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,657
Uh, what was the emergency, Mac?
Well, I couldn't get in touch with you, dude.

70
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,993
I almost called the police.
The police?

71
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,703
I mean, that's
a bit of an overreaction.

72
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,540
I was gone for what, an hour?
Yeah, but I thought we had a deal.

73
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,667
You know, you would check in
every once in a while,

74
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,128
and then that way I would know
that you were okay.

75
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,838
Okay. I- I'm okay.

76
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,548
Uh, I'm sorry.
Can we watch the movie?

77
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,592
Yeah. Great. Sure.
Yeah.

78
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,177
The Transporter 2?

79
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,305
Yeah, I-
Look, man. I-I-I...

80
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,015
I know you wanted
to see Predator again,

81
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,893
but I feel like we've seen that 30
times in the last two months...

82
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,686
and thought maybe
we could mix things up.

83
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,147
Video store clerk guy said
this movie's awesome, so...

84
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,567
The video store... clerk guy.
I feel like you won't...

85
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,319
[Chuckles]
stop talking about him.

86
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,155
Huh. I asked him for a movie
recommendation, okay?

87
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,866
Yeah. And you got one.
It's really not that big of a deal.

88
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,703
Well, the big deal, Dennis, is that I wasn't
even consulted on the decision. Okay?

89
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,247
And this is a big deal to me as well.
It's also my night.

90
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,708
Plus, Transporter 2?
We haven't seen Transporter 1,

91
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,460
which means
we'll be completely lost.

92
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,503
I doubt it.
Plus Jason Statham's physique...

93
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,255
is nothing like the lineup
in Predator.

94
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,841
Okay, stop. I don't want
to have conversations anymore...

95
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,551
about dudes' physiques,
and whether they can...

96
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,470
Dennis, in body mass alone...

97
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,972
That's what I was trying to avoid-
a conversation about body mass, okay?

98
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,391
We've had that conversation
five times a day for the last month...

99
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,019
because we keep watching Predator,
and all you talk about is Weathers...

100
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,064
and-and-and Jesse "the Body" Ventura
and how many pounds they can pack on.

101
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,275
It's important to pack on mass.
You're talking about carbo-loading.

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,110
I don't want to have this
conversation with you anymore.

103
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,197
No. You'd rather have conversations
with video store clerks.

104
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,116
You know what, man? If you don't want to
watch the movie with me, that's fine.

105
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,327
I will watch it by myself.
Goddamn it!

106
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,996
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where is this coming from?

107
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,044
I have been thinking a lot about
what Dee said, and I do think...

108
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,215
[Exhales] maybe we are spending a
little bit too much time together.

109
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,384
Wh-What are you saying?

110
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,471
I'm saying that I feel like we're
in a little bit of a rut, and...

111
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,141
I feel like I'm not...

112
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,228
flourishing.

113
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:18,275
[Clicks Tongue] Well, far
be it from me to, uh,

114
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,404
keep the flower of you
from flourishing, but, uh,

115
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,365
I guess I'll grab my shit and
stay at Charlie's. Wait.

116
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,702
Don't do that.

117
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:31,664
[Exhales] I... feel like I'm the
one that got us into this mess.

118
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,001
Okay. So you'll stay
at Charlie's then. No.

119
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,254
You should stay there...

120
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,964
because you already said
that you would.

121
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,716
Also, I have more stuff.

122
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,885
It'll take me longer to
pack, and it'll be easier.

123
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,722
[Doorbell Rings]

124
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,937
Hi. I'm responding to a
missing persons report.

125
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,944
I'll pack my things.

126
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,241
- [Knocking]
- Hey!

127
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,661
[Laughing]
Hey-oh!

128
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,621
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing here?

129
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,124
- I came to hang out with you.
- I thought it was movie night.

130
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,419
Yeah, it is movie night. But, uh, Mac and
I are taking a little bit of a break.

131
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,004
I was thinking about
what you were saying.

132
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,881
You were right.
I wasn't spending enough time by myself.

133
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,341
I wasn't being an independent individual.
I wasn't flourishing.

134
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,010
So let's watch the movie
together, you and me.

135
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,846
[Meowing] I'm kind of in the middle
of something with my cat right now.

136
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,808
Oh. Okay. Well, yeah. I like cats.
Let's bring him into the mix.

137
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,937
Uh, can't do that.
He is... in the wall somewhere.

138
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,607
- He's in the wall? - Yeah.
I think he got into the wall.

139
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,317
Wow. Well, that's a bummer.
[Meowing Continues]

140
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,027
But I'm sure he'll come out
at some point.

141
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,987
Got himself in there.
I'm sure he'll get himself out.

142
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,324
Or he won't, and he'll die in there, and
you'll have a dead cat smell for a while.

143
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,534
But listen, I'm gonna help you
out of that jam.

144
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,454
Open the windows and get some
scented candles going,

145
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,206
maybe get a big fan in here...

146
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,459
and then he'll decompose
and everything will be fine.

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,296
Boom! That's what it's like to have a sidekick.
Helped you out of a jam.

148
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,381
[Meowing Continues]

149
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,884
In the meantime, let's watch the movie.
I want to- I want to...

150
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,887
[Exhales] Just want to watch a movie...
with you.

151
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,972
Could we do that?

152
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,395
Why don't you just put your
trash into a trash can?

153
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,191
I put it in the trash can when I'm
ready to take it outside, dude.

154
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,902
Yeah, but you could skip a step
by first putting it into the can.

155
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,695
And you can
shut the hell up, man.

156
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,949
Okay. And Jesus Christ, Frank.
Are you cutting your toenails with a steak knife?

157
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,575
I suppose you have a problem
with that too?

158
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,080
Ah! Oh! Oh! Botched toe!
I botched that one.

159
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,541
Oh, that's a botch job.
That's bleeding.

160
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,543
I need some trash
to plug up the cut.

161
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,461
Do not plug an open wound
with trash.

162
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,297
- Well, it's bleeding like a sieve.
- Then use your sock, bro.

163
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,258
Don't waste a good sock on
a tiny little cut. Sock.

164
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,593
I'll find you a candy wrapper
if you give me a second. Oh.

165
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,513
Oh. Oh, wait a minute.

166
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,224
That's- That's working.
Oh, it's acting like a cut glove.

167
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,768
Ah! Unbelievable, dude.
Waste of a sock.

168
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,313
There are so many things that are gonna
need to change now that I'm living here.

169
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,023
Are you hearing this shit, bro?

170
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,984
Well, you know, he's got
some good ideas. What?

171
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,320
- Maybe it wouldn't be bad if he moved in.
- Are you serious, dude?

172
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,447
I could use a little structure
in my life here. No, man.

173
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,908
Look at all the trash all over the place.
Oh, I love the trash.

174
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,535
He's cleaning up the trash.
Mmm...

175
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,162
[Phone Ringing] I don't
want struc- [Groans]

176
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,913
Uh- Eh-
Is that Dennis?

177
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,374
I don't know who it is.
I haven't answered the phone.

178
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,293
Are you gonna answer it though, because- Okay.
Unbelievable, dude.

179
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:26,130
- I'm just gonna get it. Hello?
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?

180
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,175
Oh, Mac is being annoying as shit.
That him?

181
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,719
Oh, Mac's being annoying?
That's a big surprise.

182
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,221
He bossing you around a whole bunch?
Totally bossing me around.

183
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:38,392
Yeah. Typical. It's what he does.
It's what he does.

184
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,936
- Did he mention me?
- No.

185
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,398
No? Really? He didn't say
anything at all about me or...

186
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,692
What is this, dude?
Did you call me just to talk about Mac?

187
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,570
Okay, 'cause I don't want to talk about Mac with you.
Is he talking about me?

188
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,032
-No, no, no, no. Tell him I'm not talking about him at all.
-I'm not telling him shit, dude.

189
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm gonna hang up the phone on you.
No, no, Charlie.

190
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,162
Don't hang up the phone. I didn't call
to talk about Mac. I swear to God, dude.

191
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,623
Please. Come on. I could care less about that guy.
Are you kidding me?

192
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,918
Called to talk to you. Wanted to see if you
wanted to come over to Dee's apartment.

193
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,794
- We're doing a movie night.
- Charlie, hang up the phone.

194
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,963
Oh, my God, dude. I'll be right over.
Hang up the phone.

195
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,007
Yes! Yeah! Yes!

196
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,510
Yes. Yeah.

197
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,596
Hey, Dee.
Charlie's coming over.

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,473
I don't care.

199
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,267
Ah, shit.
I don't care either.

200
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,232
I am so excited to watch
this movie without Mac.

201
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,818
He is so annoying. He's always constantly
critiquing the fight scenes...

202
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,862
and talking about how he could
choreograph the fight scenes...

203
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,697
so much better than they could,
which is ridiculous.

204
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,700
- He doesn't know shit.
- Ooh! Dennis, I pinpointed him.

205
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,953
Dee, will you forget the
goddamn cat for a second...

206
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,080
and listen to all the interesting
things I have to say?

207
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,873
You're being the worst
sidekick right now.

208
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,708
No, you're being the worst sidekick.
[Meowing]

209
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,169
I thought sidekicks were supposed
to help each other out of jams.

210
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,046
What? I did
help you out of the jam.

211
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,215
I told you what to do with
your dead, stinking cat.

212
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,050
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

213
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,136
Oh! I lost him. I lost him, Dennis.
Thanks a lot.

214
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,306
Oh, do me a favor.
Peel this apple for me, please?

215
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,726
No! No, I'm not
gonna peel an apple for you.

216
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,520
But Mac always does it for me.

217
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,188
Why does Mac
peel your apples for you?

218
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,066
He doesn't like for me to eat
the apples with the skin on it.

219
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,609
He says the skin's
loaded with toxins.

220
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,152
Okay. Well, good news.
Mac's not here.

221
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,072
I know he's not here, and that's
why I need you to do it for me.

222
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,866
- Please? Please? - Oh, Jesus.
Just eat it with the skin on it.

223
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,078
I do not like it with the skin, Dee!
I'm not allowed to eat it with the skin!

224
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,788
- I'm not allowed!
- Oh, my God!

225
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,540
All right.
If you just shut up,

226
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,418
I will peel the apple for you the
way that Mac likes you to eat it.

227
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,295
Give it to me.
Give it to me!

228
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,714
I'll do it the way
that Mac insists. Okay?

229
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,799
Yeah.

230
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,220
Hey-oh! Is that Charlie?
Charlie's in the house!

231
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:43,350
Charlie's in the house!
Hey! Hey!

232
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,227
Hey, you want a skinless
apple, bud? Yup.

233
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,398
Two skinless apples, Dee.
Let's fire the movie up. It's movie night.

234
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,900
- Here's your apple, dick.
- All right. Yeah.

235
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,194
Where's mine?
Are you kidding me?

236
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,822
Mmm. You can peel your
own apple, Charlie.

237
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,035
Mmm. She's in a little bit of a mood
because her cat got stuck in the wall.

238
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,789
Cat in the wall, eh? Okay.
Now you're talking my language.

239
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,417
I know this game. All right.
Catch me up to speed here.

240
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,961
What do we got? You're putting
Cheeto fingers all over the wall.

241
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,422
All right. Let's focus, Dee.
What's the point of entry here?

242
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,550
That's the thing, Charlie. I've been looking all
around this goddamn place. I can't find one.

243
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,635
All right. I've seen this before.
You know what happened?

244
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,097
I bet it flattened itself out, went
right through a seam in your wall.

245
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,225
I don't think there's anything in the
laws of nature that would support that.

246
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,436
Cats do not abide by the laws
of nature, all right? Hey.

247
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,980
You don't know shit about ca- We're
still gonna watch the movie, right?

248
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,066
Uh- Uh, yeah.
Yeah?

249
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,777
I think it's stuck in there.
No! It is not stuck.

250
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,654
All right. Let's focus on what's
happening with the cat, all right?

251
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,698
It made a conscious decision
to go in your wall. Correct?

252
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,909
Really?
Absolutely. Absolutely.

253
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,578
It chose to be in there.
It wants to be in your wall, Dee.

254
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,331
Thinking about getting some catnip, and
I was gonna put it- No, no, no, no.

255
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,875
Don't do that. Don't do that.
It's gonna know that's a trap, Dee. Okay?

256
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,544
That's gonna irritate the cat, then
it's gonna dig itself down further.

257
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,338
We may never get to it.
Okay? You serious?

258
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,006
Let's start thinking
like a cat here. All right?

259
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,925
You know, we-
we need another cat.

260
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,843
Yes? That's what we need.
Here's what we're gonna do.

261
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,471
I'm gonna crack a little hole in
your wall- Tiny one. It'll be cool.

262
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,599
And then I'm gonna slip a second cat
in with a string tied around it.

263
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,976
Those two will become codependent,
then I'll rip the second cat out,

264
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,896
and the first one hopefully- hopefully
will follow. Hey, hey. Hey, man.

265
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,024
Hey. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep bugging
you, but you didn't tell me what to do.

266
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,777
I don't care. Do you want me to
start it now or wait? I'll wait.

267
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,446
Yeah. Start it. But I want to
watch it with you. I will wait.

268
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,657
Just start the movie, man, 'cause
I'm having a conversation here!

269
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,325
- All day.
- [Mouths Word]

270
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,412
All right. Where are we gonna get this other cat?
I can get you another cat.

271
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,122
I got followed here
by, like, 10 cats.

272
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,707
Yeah, they're starting to
follow me these days. Uh-I...

273
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,793
You know, I don't want you
to miss the setup.

274
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,087
[Mouths Words]

275
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,758
I got everything- all the groceries,
no cat food. [Chuckles]

276
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,469
And I bumped into
that guy at the video store.

277
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,806
- Beefcake?
- Total jerk-off.

278
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,850
[Exhales] Nice.

279
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,478
- Hey! This place is tits!
- Yeah, right? Looks good.

280
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,021
Huh? You did a great job.
Thank you.

281
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,691
Whoa! Frank! No, no!
Oh, God, dude! What?

282
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,152
The skin of those things
is riddled with toxins!

283
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,612
[Groans]
Yeah, get it out though.

284
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,990
Get it all out.
Yuck! [Spitting]

285
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,576
Whoo! That was a close call.
Good save.

286
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,327
Hey, all right.
Well, don't touch me with it.

287
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
Hey, also-
I cleaned out this closet.

288
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,457
I'm telling you, bro, we could
fit a mattress in there.

You and Charlie don't have to
sleep next to each other anymore.

Well, I- I kind of liked the other
arrangement though. That was pretty good.

291
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,301
[Chuckles] Yeah. The other arrangement
was- was not pretty good.

292
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,761
It was, um...

293

It was, uh- What- What's
the word I'm looking for?

00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,892
- Crazy. - No, it's not- not crazy.
It's like...

295
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,061
- Wackadoo.
- No. Just... stop.

Whoa! Wh-What-
What are you doing now, dude?

What? I'm taking
the toxic skin off.

Yeah, but you're cutting it
with your toe knife.

- Who gives a shit?
- Frank, that is disgusting.

What- What are you talking about?
I'm throwing it out.

301

- Wait. You're throwing my toe knife out?
- The toe knife is gone.

302
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,119
- Why would you do that?
- Because you were cutting your fruit with it!

What the hell's going on here?
Look, Mac. I mean, look. I...

304
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,292
I think the cleaning up and the throwing
the trash away is good, but the...

arrangements and the plastic...

and throwing the toe knife
out the window, that's...

I'm not gonna put on airs
just because I got company.

is putting on airs? - You betcha!

Look, I gotta take a walk.
My head is swimming.

That's fine. Just make sure you,
you know, check in. Oh, my.

'Cause I haven't heard from
Charlie, and it is getting late.

I'm gonna pop this little girl in your wall here.

Uh, I hear a squabble.

I should've gotten a bird.

do with a bird? Yeah!

They're absolutely not poisonous!

I would throw up now!

cats in there, okay?

436
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,817
Now will you step aside
and let the men do the work?

437
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,320
Shut up! Shut up, okay? I got it from here, all right?
I'm bashing a hole in my wall.

438
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,614
I'm going in myself. Give me this.
Get out of the way.

439
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,783
All right. I'm not kidding.
Get the hell out of the way.

440
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,785
Oh. I'm dead serious.
I'm going in. I've had enough.

441
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,787
Go for it.
Bash away. Bash away.

442
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,666
[Shouting] [Frank] Whoa!
Oh!

443
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,419
- I'm gonna get you, you jerk!
- Yeah! Yeah, Deandra!

444
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,839
[Panting] Come on, kitty.

445
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,341
[Meowing]
Oh. Come on.

446
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,636
Okay. I'll get you.
I'll get you.

447
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,346
Wait- Oh.

448
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,223
Wow! There are
a lot of cats back here!

449
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,475
Yeah. We put a lot of cats in there.
[Cell Phone Rings]

450
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,936
Oh, I'm getting a text.
Ooh. Who is it?

451
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,647
Ah, the dynamic duo in effect.
Oh, they're back together!

452
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,274
[Chuckles] Yeah.
All right.

453
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,859
They're watching Predator.
You want to join?

454
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,360
Absolutely, dude.
Great.

455
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,945
Deandra, we're out of here.
Yeah.

456
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,614
Hey, you guys?
We're going.

457
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,824
Yeah? You guys, I think
I'm stuck in the wall.

458
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,410
That's why she needs a friend.
You gotta have a sidekick.

459
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,329
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying.

460
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,165
All right- Oops. Okay, I'm trying to back
out, but my shirt's caught on something.

461
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,500
[Cats Screeching, Hissing]
Guys?

462
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,086
Guys?
Guys, come on!

463
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,125
