How are ya?

From October 28, 2008,
to November 1, 2008,

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,061
you were issued a series
of parking citations totaling $1,300.

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,399
- Who are these people? - Oh, uh, these
people are here to corroborate my story.

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,693
- It's a parking violation.
- Oh, well.

8
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,362
I think you'll find it goes
much, much deeper than that.

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,240
Yes, Lady Madam of the court,
I do believe that this court will realize...

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,035
that we were all victims of a terrible ordeal
that caused each and every one of us...

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,830
great physical
and emotional trauma.

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,373
And what is this ordeal?

13
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,460
The Philadelphia Phillies winning
the World Series, Your Honor.

14
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:23,249
Okay, Mr. Reynolds. On what grounds
are you contesting these tickets?

15
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,418
Well- What grounds?
Where do we even begin?

16
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh, yeah.
On many grounds, Your Honor.

17
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,213
Many, many grounds.
Yes.

18
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,674
And let the record show that we are
waiving our right to an attorney.

19
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,011
Just explain to me why you feel you should
not have been issued these tickets.

20
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,805
Okay. Um, yeah.
Well, I think in order to do that,

21
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,099
we should probably start
at the top of the story.

22
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,101
I know what the story is.
Oh, all right.

23
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,437
It was game five
of the World Series,

24
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,439
and we actually had tickets.

25
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,691
Needless to say,
I mean, we were pumped.

acceptable to be shirtless in a public forum.

36
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,305
So I'm blasting bare chest the whole time.
What do you think?

37
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,682
- Smart.
- I think you're gonna be cold as shit.

38
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,769
I'm not gonna be cold at all 'cause
I'm gonna be wasted on grain alcohol.

39
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,022
Grain alcohol. Whenever there's a potential
riot, I'm getting blasted on grain alcohol.

40
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,816
Riot juice!

Oh, we got bed bugs, dude.

53
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,393
Okay, in the bottom of the ninth when the
Phillies are up by, like, 50 or 60 runs,

54
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,854
Dennis and I are gonna start
beating the shit out of each other.

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,981
Which will attract the
attention of Security. Yeah.

He's got a stranglehold on the
Philly mascot scene. It's not fair!

67
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,971
I got a pretty good thing going with Green Man.
I don't see why there can only be one mascot.

only room for one green idiot...

- I don't have the tickets in my pocket!

72
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,191
- [Charlie] What, dude?
- Nowhere. I know exactly where I left them.

73
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,360
I left them on the coffee table
in the apartment.

74

We don't have time to go back.
We're not gonna get a good spot for the tailgating!

the parking lot, get us a good spot.

out which player I want to kiss...

82
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,635
when I thrust myself out
on that field.

All right. Fine!

101
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,307
I'll have to scale the building, cut a hole
in the tent, smash through the window.

102
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,309
That'll cut down
on occupancy time.

You are not capable
of doing that.

Goddamn it, Dee! Goddamn it!

106

Oh, my God! Those guys can't get
in there to get the tickets.

That's poisonous gas, dude. You can't breathe that.

112
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,294
Screw 'em, right? What are you suggesting?
Maybe we sneak into the game?

113
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,047
I want to get into that game.
I don't even want to tailgate anymore, bro.

114

Oh, you're right! We gotta sneak in.
All right. We're gonna sneak.

115
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,927
How are we gonna sneak in though, bro?
Security's gonna be crazy.

116
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,221
There's a couple ways
you can do it.

117
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,516
One, we can take the secret tunnel that
goes from the Ollidy lnn into the stadium.

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,226
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

119
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,729
There's no secret tunnel going from
the stadium to the Ollidy Inn.

120
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,273
What the hell are you talking about?
This is common knowledge, bro.

121
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,276
There is. They built a secret tunnel
so that the visiting players...

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,821
can get safely back to the hotel without
the Phillies fans hammering them.

123
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,532
We're passionate fans. Passionate fans.
We gotta hammer something.

124
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,243
So they got a tunnel for that? Wow.
Don't you think there's gonna be security there too?

125
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,954
There might. All right.
You know what? I got it.

126
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,623
We're gonna do a Charlie One-Two, all right?
You're gonna do this, okay?

127
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,752
Okay. One, you jump in front of
a car coming into the stadium.

128
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,921
Two, you say, "I'm gonna sue you
if you don't give me tickets."

129
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,300
No! No!
That is a terrible plan.

130
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,969
How is that terrible?
Because it involves me getting hit by a car.

131
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,514
You'll be fine, bro. You're drinking riot punch, man.
You'll bounce off that thing.

132
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,267
It's called the Charlie One-Two.
You do it.

133
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,269
Well, no.
I've done too many, man.

134
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,856
The next one could be my last.
I don't want to get hit by a moving car.

135
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,233
You'll be fine!
This is the World Series, man.

136
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,153
I don't want to do any more,
dude. I could die.

137
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,614
You do it.

138
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,700
All right, goddamn it. I'm gonna do it.
Let's do it! Last time. One last time.

139
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,707
Too shitty, right?
Crappy car. Yeah.

140
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,086
No, you don't want to jump out in front of a shitty car.
We need rich people tickets.

141
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,630
Rich seats. Oh. Ooh. This guy right here.
This is a good one.

142
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,675
This is gonna be a good one, dude.
He's gonna have such good seats. Go, go, go! Go!

143

Bro, that guy was gonna have great seats.

144
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,764
Yeah. I felt like I didn't have a good angle.
What do you mean?

145
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,266
I might go this way.
You just jump right out in front of him.

146
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,685
This guy'll have good seats.
Don't get cold feet on me.

[Screaming]

149
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,986
Your Honor, so my friend here pushed me
in front of a moving car. No big deal.

150
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,781
Ladies and gentlemen of the court,
these were dire times,

151
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,159
and dire actions were needed
to get those tickets!

152
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,163
But we didn't get the tickets, Charlie, because
the guy saw you push me in front of his car.

153
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,998
Yeah, that's true.
We didn't get the tickets.

154
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,334
So you guys tried to scam
your way into the game...

155
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,336
by throwing each other
in front of cars...

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,839
with the hopes of extorting tickets
from the drivers.

157

Let the record show that the three of us do
not condone the actions of the two of them.

- Get back to your case.
- Okay.

163
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,109
So anyway, the three of us are back at
their apartment trying to get the tickets,

164
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,111
and Mac is scaling the building.

165
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,114
[Grunts] Well, it's just I couldn't
get a good grip, you know?

166
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,783

- Hey, you guys.

167

Look, I found
this garden hose. All right?

168
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,538
I'm gonna use it to pump
fresh air into the building...

169
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,498
and breathe into it
like a scuba diver.

170
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,209
That actually seems like it could work.
Yeah. Let's give it a shot.

171
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,712
I'll try it out. Okay.
I'll go- Yeah.

player selection conversation, okay?

179
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,066
'Cause I got some-
got some thoughts.

180
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,569
Yeah, I've been thinking about it.
Ryan Howard, right?

181
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
Mmm.
[Groans]

182
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,574
What? Look, if it's me, I'm going
Chase Utley 100% of the time.

183
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,119
He's a power-hitting second baseman.
Do you know how rare that is in the National League?

184
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,622
And he's hot, which is number one on my list.
Of course he is.

185
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,250
But I really like Ryan Howard.
You're kissin' Chase Utley, and that's it.

186
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,003
Why are you pushing Chase Utley on me?
It's starting to get weird.

187
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,422
Okay, look.
I have a plan, all right?

188
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,926
And it involves you getting this letter to
him when you get out there to kiss him.

189
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,845
I have given this to Major
League Baseball, his lawyer,

190
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,555
his manager, his mom,

191
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,391
and he has not gotten back to me,
which means he hasn't gotten it yet.

192
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,852
So just-
Okay. What is in this letter?

193
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,438
That's none of your business, all right?
Just get it to Chase.

194
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,900
Did you write a love letter
to Chase Utley? Is that...

195
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,612
In a lot of ways,
yes, I do love him,

196
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,657
but that is not a love letter in the
way that you're thinking of it, okay?

197

Look, it's starting to get packed.
Just forget about it, okay?

287
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,175
It's impossible to get into that stadium.
Trust me. Take my word for it.

288
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,136
No, that's not good enough!
We've gotta get in so Dee can kiss Chase Utley and...

289
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,597
Well, how the hell are you planning
on getting in there, Mac?

290
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,892
Uh- You put me on the spot! First thing
that comes to my head, scaling the facade.

291
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,771
I know I soured on that earlier, but I believe
that is my mind telling me I have it in me!

292
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,398
I hate to tell you this, bro, but you
do not have the core strength...

293
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,734
to scale the facade of
Citizens Bank- you just don't.

294
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,904
What? I work out all the time!
You only work out your glamour muscles, and you know it.

295
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,740
I work out my core!
No, you do not work out your core.

296
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,201
You're totally arm heavy.
You're all bi's and tri's.

297
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,537
And everything else
is just fat and ribs.

298
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,415
Bro, I can do way more push-ups than you,
and that's like 16 different muscle groups.

299
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,918
That is beyond retarded,
what you're saying right now.

300
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,005
I can do way more push-ups than you
even though I was just hit by a car.

301
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:49,638
One, two, three, four, five...

302
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,433
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11-
All right, enough!

303
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,144
- Stop it!
- All right.

304
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,105
But you get my point,
Your Honor,

305
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,899
and you could see that Mac was
slowing down at the end there. What?

306
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,027
And let the record show that that is because
he only works out his glamour muscles.

307
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,321
No, that's- That's bullshit!
I did, like, three more than you!

308
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,075
Yeah, but you were- I wasn't slowing down.
Put that on the record!

309
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,536
Strike that from the record.
I don't think you did three more.

310
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,955
- Oh, no! You saw it! She saw it!
- I need this story...

311
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,584
[Charlie] Sustained.
To come to an end soon.

312
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,169
Okay. Fair enough, Your Honor.
I will bring this story to a close very soon.

313
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,171
Okay, so- Let me pick up
where we left off.

314
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,258
We were at the parking lot, and I had just
punched him in the face for cheating...

315
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,719
like he just tried to do
right here in the courtroom.

316
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,304
Stop handing me papers.

317
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,055
[Mac] Why did you
hammer my nose, bro?

318
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,600
I hammered your nose because you
disqualified me for no good reason.

319
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,852
Because you had bad form, dude!
What are you talking about?

320
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,313
You were slowing down, and you
just tried to- That's bullshit.

321
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,732
I got hammered so hard! Yeah?
Well, you deserve it, asshole!

322
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,358
Charlie, who hammered you?

323
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,777
Just some overly passionate
Phillies fans. Who do you think?

324
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,031
You getting hammered by Philly
fans is reminding me of something.

325
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,867
There is a secret tunnel between
the stadium and the Ollidy Inn.

326
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,953
I know, dude! I was telling this guy
about the tunnel! No! That's not true.

327
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,540
They built it 'cause Phillies fans hammer
people all the time! That's a known tunnel.

328
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,334
They gotta get the players out!
It's underground.

329
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,544
Everybody knows about the tunnel.
Let's give the tunnel a shot.

330
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,588
Well, let's get in!
We've got nothing to lose.

331
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,715
It's starting.
You hear that shit? I hear it.

332
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,592
Is that- It seems
like it's gonna rain.

333
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,011
Don't ever disqualify me again for a
bullshit reason, or I'll hammer you again.

334
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,262
Was your form off?

335
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,017
Try to look inconspicuous.
Inconspicuous?

336
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,519
We all look like we've been
in a terrible fight, Frank.

337
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,064
Everybody in here looks like
they've been in a terrible fight.

338
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,608
These two ladies are in the middle
of a terrible fight right now.

339
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,277
Phillies fans are brutal.
There's the elevator. Go! Go!

340
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,448
All right. Which way is it, dude?
Which way? Uh, let's try this way.

341
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,243
The game is about to start, and this
damn thing is not giving me a signal.

342
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,663
Damn it. I don't know if I'm
on board with this plan, man.

343
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,208
I might just go up to the hotel bar and watch
it up there, then join the riot afterwards.

344
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,336
Maybe you're right. If we can't go to the game,
we should be able to watch it somewhere.

345
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,297
We're getting in the game, all right?
[Dee] Just hurry up.

346
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,966
All right, hang on a second.
This looks good down here.

347
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,719
Bingo. Look at this little room.
This has got to be something, right?

348
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,763
All right. Here we go.

349
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,765
It's a linen closet, Charlie.

350
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,476
Yeah. They want you to think
it's a linen closet, Frank!

351
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,728
All right, check behind the
shelves and shit. Why?

352
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,315
In Scooby-Doo, secret tunnels are always
behind shelves. There's gonna be one.

353
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,694
Could we not base our decisions on what does
and doesn't happen in episodes of Scooby-Doo?

354
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,904
Goddamn it! Let's get up to
the bar before the game ends!

355
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,906
Yeah, let's go.
Come on.

356
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,574
Oh, shit. It's locked.
What?

357
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,785
What do you mean, it's locked?
It's locked!

358
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,913
Help! Hey!
Somebody help us!

359
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,915
Guys!

360
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,292
Check this out.

361
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,628
- No!
- [Laughing]

362
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,505
Holy shit.
Is it really?

363
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,674
This is the way. [Charlie] Hang on.
It's dark in here.

364
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,634
But it sounds like it's a tunnel.

365
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,095
[Frank] It's dark as hell in here.
[Dee] I can't see anything.

366
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,680
[Mac] It stinks.
[Dennis] Awful.

367
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,349
[Charlie] Hang on. Hang on.
I found a light.

368

370
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,695
No, no!

371
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,365
[Screaming]

372
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,869
No, stop it! No! Uh-uh! No!

373
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:03,206
Are you telling me you all found a
dungeon at the bottom of the Ollidy Inn?

374
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,208
No. No, no.
No, no. Not really.

375
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,420
I just added that last part at the
end there to spice the story up...

376
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,548
'cause if I'm being honest, it kind of
seemed like we were losing you for a bit.

377
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,592
Yeah, you weren't paying
attention, but- But now you are.

378
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,721
But the point is, we did get stuck
in that linen closet for six days.

379
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,807
Yes, we did. And as you know, there
was a rain delay on the game.

380
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,894
We missed the game. We missed the riot.
We missed the parade. We missed everything.

381
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,898
Yeah. And the only way we got out is some
maid came after six days to get fresh towels.

382
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,735
Yeah. How does the hotel not run
out of towels for six days?

383
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,988
Let the record show that we question
that hotel's sanitation procedures.

384
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,115
Absolutely.
[Frank] It's a filthy place.

385
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,993
And while we were stuck
in that tiny little room for six days,

386
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,954
surviving only on sink water
and peppermint candies...

387
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,124
and what little bit of riot punch
we had left at that point,

388
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,668
my car accumulated the massive
amount of parking tickets...

389
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,587
that brings us
before you today.

390
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,591
So I submit to you that not only should
I be excused of those parking tickets,

391
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,344
but I think, um, we're really owed
compensation for the entire ordeal.

392
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,387
Compensation.
Because we went through some shit!

393
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,807
- Is that it?
- [Dennis] Um...

394
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,517
I think that about
covers the bases, yeah.

395
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,229
Because I do not find that your
story excuses your behavior.

396
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,980
In fact, it actually seems like...

397
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,026
you committed a litany
of additional crimes in the process.

398
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,695
I order you to pay the original fine.

399
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,239
Next case!

400
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,282
I didn't want to do this,
but I'm gonna have to...

401
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,368
I'm calling kangaroo court on this one!
A kangaroo court!

402
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,995
It's a kangaroo court.
I'm calling kangaroo court because...

403
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,081
And you know what?
I'm gonna toss in my countersuit.

404
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,208
Uh, Charlie Kelly versus
Major League Baseball...

405
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,293
A countersuit, Charlie?
And the Philly Phrenetic.

406
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,004
Don't do it, Charlie. I'm mad that this guy.
He's got a stranglehold...

407
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,090
Oh, boy. Look what's happening.
On the mascot scene.

408
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,134
First of all, I had to call him the Phrenetic.
His name's the Phanatic.

409
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,680
But I'm gonna get sued by Major League
Baseball if I call him the Phanatic.

410
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,392
And let's talk about steroids!
Can we talk about steroids?

411
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,186
Can we talk about steroid abuse?
It's bullshit!

412
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,481
It's ruining the game!
It's ruining it!
