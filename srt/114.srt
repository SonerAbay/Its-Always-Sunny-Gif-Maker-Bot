1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:02,581
<i>Uh... I feel like</i>
<i>you guys should have,</i>

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,383
<i>like, dressed up</i>
<i>a little bit for this.</i>

3
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>No, no, it sends</i>
<i>the wrong image, you know?</i>

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,120
Uh, we're not selling
a game for squares,

5
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:10,372
we're selling a game for, like,
everyday people like us, man.

6
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,590
Yeah, that's a good point.

7
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:12,791
Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank.

8
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:13,959
You will never guess
what happened. Okay.

9
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,211
So this guy comes in, right?

10
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:16,378
We think he's just
a regular customer.

11
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:17,930
We start chatting him up.

12
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:19,632
Turns out, he's an
executive at Mattel.

13
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:20,683
Yeah, so of course
we start talking

14
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:21,934
to him about Chardee MacDennis,

15
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,302
and he seemed totally into it.

16
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,687
Yeah, he's coming by today, man.

17
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:25,893
We're gonna pitch it to him.

18
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:27,473
Maybe we could, uh, work in

19
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:28,974
some of the ideas
I've been suggesting.

20
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,726
Those aren't "ideas"
as much as they are...

21
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,478
random acts of violence.

22
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:35,731
Well, you see, when I was a kid,
games were much more violent.

23
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,733
I mean, we used to play
"Purple Nurple,"

24
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:39,652
"Sock Full of Quarters,"
"Kick the Jew"...

25
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,224
No, why don't you
try winning one time?

26
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,539
And then you can start
throwing in new rules.

27
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:45,491
How about we just change
the name of the game then?

28
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:47,576
"Franken MacChardeeden."

29
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:48,911
What?
That's terrible.

30
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:49,912
First of all,

31
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:51,664
your name isn't "Franken."

32
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:53,465
Secondly, Chardee MacDennis
is just a working title.

33
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,833
Technically, we're still
in arbitration.

34
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,253
Last we left it,
Dee had filibustered,

35
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:58,721
and Charlie had
a motion pending.

36
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,306
And I will not yield
to the gentleman.

37
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,590
'Cause you have no honor,
you goddamn bitch.

38
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,392
You have no honor!

39
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:05,177
You see what I'm talking about--
it's a whole thing, Frank.

40
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:09,565
Then let's call it "Chardee
MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo."

41
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,930
What?
What are you talking about?

42
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,818
What does that have
to do with anything?

43
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,270
What made you just
think of that?

44
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,988
It's not a break-dancing
competition.

45
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:17,189
There's no electricity involved.

46
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,691
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

47
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:22,194
Hey, there, how's it
going, uh... Andy was it?

48
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,829
Yes, exactly.
Ah, Andy, I want you to meet Frank.

49
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:24,863
Frank, uh, meet Andy
from Mattel.

50
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,332
Hello, hello.

51
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,033
I got to tell ya--
I'm pretty excited.

52
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,753
Adult game play is
a fast-rising market,

53
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:31,954
and we are always on the lookout

54
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,372
for something a little
out of the box.

55
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,758
Oh, we-we can help
you there, bud.

56
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:38,043
That's great. Now, what was
the name of the game again?

57
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,430
Chardee MacDennis 2:
Electric Boogaloo.

58
00:01:52,348 --> 00:02:02,806
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

59
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,888
Okay, Andy, you're gonna like
this video we made for you.

60
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,093
Chardee MacDennis.

61
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,849
Chardee MacDennis is all your
favorite games rolled into one:

62
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:18,234
<i>Mouse Trap,</i>
<i>Chutes and Ladders, Sorry...</i>

63
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,739
But it's not exactly
like those things.

64
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,575
It's also like Boggle,
Wheel of Fortune, Risk.

65
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,910
<i>Chardee MacDennis!</i>

66
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,244
What other games do you like?

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,412
It's like those other games too!

68
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,613
But more better.

69
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,083
And different enough legally.

70
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,417
I'm a lawyer.
Shh!

71
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:35,453
I'm a lawyer in this part.

72
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:36,453
We're like Moby...

73
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,621
remix!

74
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:40,623
<i>Ch-Ch-Chardee MacDennis!</i>

75
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,625
Regular board games
should be called...

76
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:44,844
"I'm bored... games"

77
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,546
I don't get that one.

78
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,432
I... No, I told you not to...
Stay out of my peripheral...

79
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,519
Do you want a game that lulls
you into a sense of security,

80
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,554
<i>but surprises you</i>
<i>with constant rule changes?</i>

81
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,522
Then you want
the game of games...

82
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:56,973
Back... back up.
Sorry.

83
00:02:57,058 --> 00:03:00,360
<i>Chardee MacDennis!</i>

84
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,196
We always win.
And they always lose.

85
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,041
What are you guys doing over there?
Oh, shit.

86
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,151
W-Why'd you put that in?
Yeah, what was that?

87
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:09,702
Factually accurate.

88
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:12,405
So, Andy, what did you think?

89
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,574
I... got to say,

90
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,459
it's a little confusing.

91
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,995
Uh, can't we just play the game?

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,079
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Yeah.

93
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,831
That wouldn't be good.

94
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:24,918
Yeah, see, we tend to get a
little competitive when we play.

95
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,836
You know, we're not exactly
a mellow bunch.

96
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,887
Right. That'll be fun.
Plus, that's the best way

97
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:30,673
for me to understand the game.

98
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:33,259
But that's what... why you would understand...
Yeah, that's why we did that.

99
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,061
Okay, let me confer
with my associates for a minute.

100
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:36,846
Why don't you grab a drink?
It's o-on the house, of course.

101
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,648
Um, guys, can we talk?
Uh, cool, man.

102
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:41,351
I think we can probably, um...

103
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,353
We can't...
No, no, no... no, no,

104
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:44,988
I-I think we can.
Uh, we can do this, guys.

105
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,656
We just got to be...
just got to make it fun.

106
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,191
You know what we have to do?
Is we have to not care

107
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:50,193
about who wins. Just for this time.
Yes.

108
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:52,328
That'll help. That will help.
We just have to sell the game.

109
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:53,580
Just sell it. Okay. We can do it.
All right,

110
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,114
so, Frank, you'll
be on Andy's team.

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Wait, don't
stick me with him. He-he

112
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:57,700
doesn't know the goddamn rules.

113
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:58,701
I'm gonna get crushed again.

114
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,587
Shut up, Frank, just...

115
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,705
Shut up. Shut up. It's not
about winning or losing.

116
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,957
Exactly. It doesn't matter. It's fun.
We're not gonna care...

117
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,792
It's fun.
So we'll just...

118
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,010
we'll keep our emotions
in check.

119
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,044
Yeah.
Sure.

120
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,009
Just be like:

121
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:10,947
Exactly.

122
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:17,770
Gentlemen, good luck to you.

123
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,606
And to yous. And to yous all.

124
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,274
This is nice--
a little role playing.

125
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,976
Very big in gaming right now.

126
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,727
This also celebrates
sportsmanship.

127
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,362
Yes, indeed. Yeah, well,
you're totally getting it.

128
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,114
You're catching on.
Oh, by the way, there used to be

129
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,567
a couple rules about not cursing
and not asking questions

130
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:32,402
in certain rounds, but I think
we should do away with that,

131
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:34,153
for now, because it's your
first time playing and, guys,

132
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,573
we don't want
anybody blacking out.

133
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:38,041
Yeah, no problem. Right, that's fine.
I think that'll be fine.

134
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,042
We're flexible.
It's a good idea.

135
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:40,493
Okay, are we ready?

136
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,579
Three, two, one.

137
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:45,048
Gentlemen...
suck my dick.

138
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,306
Hut,

139
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,592
hut, hut.

140
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,325
What the hell's going on?

141
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,611
Oh, uh, this is our
flag-raising ceremony.

142
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:16,613
Yeah, we used to do
the Maori war dance,

143
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,164
but that-that got us
a little too riled up.

144
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,616
Either way, this is
all about intimidation

145
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,117
and showing off your prowess.

146
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,335
Uh, think of it like

147
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,120
the Indian-Pakistani
border ceremony

148
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:25,165
that they do over there.

149
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,529
Now, this is Mac
and Charlie's flag,

150
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,398
which, as you can see,
is fairly badly burned.

151
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,099
Not only does the winner get to

152
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,517
stomp the loser's game pieces,

153
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,218
but they also get to
burn their flag up.

154
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,276
Now, you'll notice
that the Golden Geese flag

155
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,810
is unsullied.
You'll also notice that

156
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,279
Mac and Charlie's flag is
just a little weird,

157
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,064
and that's because
their original name

158
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,782
was the Thundercats,

159
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,535
uh... but they were
confused by that.

160
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,036
Well, 'cause we're not cats.
Yeah.

161
00:05:57,122 --> 00:06:00,406
We're not cats.
So, then, how could we...

162
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:01,708
Mm-hmm. Even though
it's the name they chose.

163
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,459
So they went with
the Thundermen.

164
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,000
This brings us to Frank's flag,

165
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,386
which is, uh... yeah,
it's just unfortunate.

166
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,171
It's four Fs.

167
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,756
I didn't know it was
gonna come off like that.

168
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,224
Pretty sure you did.

169
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:33,656
Okay, Andy, Level 1 is Trivia,
Puzzles and Artistry.

170
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,074
The first team
to get three points

171
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,360
moves their game piece
to the next level.

172
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,696
All right. Here we go.
All right.

173
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:43,533
What Philly celebrity would you most
want to have a drink with? Oh, shit,

174
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,251
okay, yeah, you know what--
a lot of the questions

175
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,170
are opinion-based. Heads up.
Ah. Okay... I-I see.

176
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,505
Uh, all right, this is,
uh, let me guess. Um...

177
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,041
Oh: Dr. J.

178
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:53,793
That's not it! All
right, all right.

179
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,378
Play it cool, play it cool.
Okay, okay, sorry.

180
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,296
Yeah, all right. That is wrong,
though. You wouldn't

181
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,881
want to have a drink with him.
Dee, chance to steal.

182
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,683
Bill Cosby. Yes! All right.

183
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,018
Point for us.
Shit.

184
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,052
A lot of the questions
are outdated.

185
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:04,053
Yeah, yeah, they are

186
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:05,638
a little outdated.

187
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,140
Okay, our turn, our turn.

188
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:09,275
Um, artistry. And it's
an all-play, guys.

189
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,777
Oh! Oh!
All right, now,

190
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,946
a member of each team
must make this clue out of clay

191
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,474
while the other member
tries to guess what it is.

192
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,152
Okay, uh, penis.
What?

193
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,204
Uh, lip-penis.
What? No, look, look.

194
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,739
Oh, hard penis.

195
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:23,873
A hard clay penis.
Oh...

196
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,324
Gargoyle inside.
No?

197
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,076
It's a-a, okay,
a chopped-off head,

198
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:28,878
a decapitat...
uh, head in a box!

199
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:30,380
Dee, I'm gonna put
your head in a box

200
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,664
if you don't start
getting the answer right.

201
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,582
Goddamn it!
A heart, it's a heart!

202
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,217
Uh, it's, uh...

203
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,718
it's, uh, love!
Love!

204
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:36,835
Oh! He got it! Was that it?

205
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,824
Get another card. How
do you make a heart?

206
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:41,674
If the... Love?

207
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,010
Yeah, because I was making,
uh, Cupid's arrow, dude.

208
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,762
Well, why does it have
a big vein running through it?

209
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:48,014
Because that's the streak
as it flies through the air.

210
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,016
Come... At least I didn't
put a woman's head in a box.

211
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:53,102
This is not a woman's head
in a box, you sick freak.

212
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,405
This is a woman's
head in a freezer.

213
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,856
And it's supposed to represent
the preservation

214
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,524
of love forever and ever.

215
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,943
Whatever, dude. It's our turn,
it's our turn. We go.

216
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:02,495
No puzzles, no puzzles,
no puzzles, no puzzles

217
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,863
no puzzles, no puzzles...

218
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:05,915
Puzzles.
Oh!

219
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,450
Put this bottle back together.

220
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:08,835
Oh, shit.
Oh. Yeah.

221
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,519
Oh, that's interesting.

222
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,897
What bottle?

223
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:14,707
This one.

224
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:23,466
Now just be very, very careful.
Okay.

225
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,602
Final touches, final touches.
Watch that blue string--

226
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:28,187
don't pull it apart.
Okay, okay, okay.

227
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,056
Okay, okay. All right.
Ready, ready?

228
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,975
Okay, okay,
okay... okay.

229
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:36,362
Okay, very... Very careful.
Very, very careful.

230
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,197
It held.
It held!

231
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,367
It held! Just swallowed a
little glass, but it held, man!

232
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,152
You see, that's what I'm talking
about-- you sacrifice,

233
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:44,454
you put the work in...
That's right!

234
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,038
you earn that card.

235
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:46,989
We're catching up to 'em.
Hey... Okay,

236
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,041
it's our turn, then.

237
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,294
Dennis and Dee
skip right to Level 2.

238
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,212
Yes, yes! Aw... Aw...

239
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,466
Face, face!

240
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,785
Due to some alcohol-related
cheating, we decided

241
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,403
to incorporate I.V.'s

242
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,224
to keep everything
on the up-and-up.

243
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,745
You guys were the ones that were cheating.
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,448
Now, I feel like Andy
has to have one of these.

245
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,649
Well, Andy's our guest.
We don't want to be

246
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,451
poking him with needles.

247
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:12,369
Unfair, unfair!
Yeah, unfair, unfair, unfair.

248
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:15,122
Hey, hey, as you can see,
Mac and Charlie

249
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:17,908
are a little worked up about
never having won the game. Ever.

250
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:20,127
I'm a little concerned
about the safety of this.

251
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:21,545
The... Why... Oh, oh,
If it were beer?

252
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,413
No, no, no, no--
we're mainlining wine.

253
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,632
It's not beer. We switched
Level 2 to wine because

254
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:28,085
you can't mainline beer because
it's got bubbles in it and shit.

255
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,053
We tried-- it was bad.
I'm not sure it's safe

256
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,673
for people to put those
beverages directly in... Time!

257
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:39,446
Oh!

258
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:45,569
Okay, Andy, welcome to Round 2:

259
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:48,188
Physical Challenge,
Pain and Endurance.

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,656
Okay, now, we've added
a new challenge

261
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,658
to Level 2-- this is,
this is really exciting.

262
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:54,161
So what you do-- you spin the
globe, you point your finger.

263
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:56,997
Wherever your finger lands,
you have to speak in the accent

264
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:58,365
of that region for
the rest of the round,

265
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,616
otherwise, you gotta drink.

266
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,142
That sounds fun.
That's a great idea.

267
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:02,369
Isn't that good?
Isn't that good?

268
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,704
Let's go.
Uh... ha!

269
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:05,172
Russia!

270
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,591
Oh, okay, so I got it.
I guess I...

271
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,710
I guess I got to do that?

272
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:10,961
Huh?
You do Russia.

273
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,963
Hey, look at Andy, look at Andy.

274
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:14,882
Okay, let's see...

275
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,016
What do you got?
"Brasial."

276
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:17,217
No, Brazil.
Mm-hmm.

277
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,219
Wh-What's the accent
of Brazil?

278
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:21,271
It's a-it's a country in South
America-- why don't we say

279
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:23,440
any Latin American accent'll do?
Any Latin American? Okay.

280
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,226
Okay, homie.
Uh... <i>Hola, le homes.</i>

281
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,730
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.
Okay, man. Nachos.

282
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:32,449
Oh, real racist with it, huh? Yeah, that
is extremely racist-- and by the way,

283
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:35,485
that's more of a Los Angeles
sort of Mexican cholo vibe.

284
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,051
Let's go... let's go see the Dodgers
play the Lakers. Low rider.

285
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:39,907
Okay. Uh, Dee, you
want to spin for us?

286
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,159
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jesus Christ.

287
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:45,629
Oh! Ah, would you
look at that--

288
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,631
Philadelphia.
That shouldn't be on there.

289
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:50,000
You barely spinned it, homes.
That's bullshit, man.

290
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,386
Hallelujah.
Looks like the tide's turned.

291
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,254
Yeah, looks like
we got an advantage

292
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,557
over yous guys, huh, Den?

293
00:10:58,177 --> 00:10:59,426
What is going on?

294
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,094
What the hell is that?

295
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:03,480
My Philly accent.

296
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,265
Wow, that's not even close.

297
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,601
Drink, homes.
Ow! Okay, slower.

298
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,519
All right.

299
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,773
Physical challenge.
And this one's an all-play.

300
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:13,907
Oh! Hey! Okay,

301
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:15,192
everybody.
This is good. We like...

302
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:16,994
Hands on a bird body!

303
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,195
A member from each team

304
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,746
must try and keep their hand

305
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:22,616
on Dee's bony body for
as long as they can.

306
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:24,952
Dis is shit.
Dis is not good.

307
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,453
I don't understand.

308
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,459
Hang in there, homes. I can't
do it, "mang." I can't do it.

309
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:33,627
You barely even put your
hand on there already.

310
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,295
Hang in there, man.
I know, but...

311
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:36,964
Ah! I can't do it, I can't do it!
Oh! Ha!

312
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,882
Mac, that's crazy!
Ay, ay, ay!

313
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,801
Mac and Charlie are out!

314
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,970
Hey, why'd you do that?

315
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:44,688
I couldn't do it!
Ay, ay, ay!

316
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,140
Oh, violation!
That's not L.A. Mexican.

317
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:49,309
That's, like, Cartoon Mexican.

318
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:50,811
We barely even switched it, homie.
No, I don't know.

319
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,312
I'll have a drink, all right?
You got to drink, too.

320
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:54,231
Oh...
What is so hard

321
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:56,066
about keeping one
hand on this woman?

322
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:58,368
She's a very pleasant woman.
She's a very, very pretty woman.

323
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:01,371
Ugh. Don't sexualize her, dude.
This is bad enough as it is.

324
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:04,124
Vhat is the matter, Dennis?

325
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,410
Vhy are you zo uncomfortable?

326
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:07,995
Because the closeness

327
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,497
of your hand to her breast...

328
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:11,832
Stop. Yeah, stop.
...which is

329
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,835
making you want to have sex
with her?

330
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,137
Don't, don't... oh, goddamn it!
Ugh! Oh... Oh!

331
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:18,472
Wait, what's...

332
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:20,007
what's going on?
You stupid idiot.

333
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,009
Oh, my God, you glued
your hand to her!

334
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,477
Cheater! Cheater!
Cheater!

335
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,679
Oh, is that the accent drop?
Yeah, yeah,

336
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:27,648
all accents are dropped
the minute someone

337
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:28,849
gets caught cheating. Yeah,
yeah, we have to be able

338
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,267
to break them in
our native tongue

339
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:31,852
to allow for maximum shame.

340
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:33,417
Shame, shame, shame...
Shame, shame...

341
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:39,860
So... so no more I.V.'s?

342
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:42,112
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
That's a Level 2 game.

343
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:44,114
You don't want to mainline liquor, buddy.
You don't want to do it.

344
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,749
Still a pretty stiff drink.

345
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:46,700
Oh, yeah. Things
get ratcheted up

346
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:48,085
in Level 3.

347
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,453
Then even get worse in Level 4.

348
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:51,204
There is no Level 4.

349
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,424
Yes, there is:
Mind, body, spirit, horror.

350
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,626
Stop, Frank. Come on.
There's no horror level.

351
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,712
Look, Andy, his ideas
don't represent the game.

352
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,180
They don't represent us.

353
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:02,549
Okay, pick a card now...
Whoa!

354
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,801
Shits and Ladders.

355
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,053
Oh!

356
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:07,938
Sort of a play
on<i> Chutes and Ladders.</i>

357
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:10,974
Oh, yeah. Each member must take
a laxative and get on a ladder.

358
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,694
- The one who can hold it in the
longest wins. - Love this one.

359
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:15,612
Also known
as Shoots and Splatters.

360
00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:17,230
Poops and Bladders!

361
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,566
Andy!

362
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:22,152
I'll go get the laxatives.
All right, All right.

363
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,237
Here you go.

364
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:26,123
Strongest stuff on the market.

365
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,658
All right.
All right.

366
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,045
Mm. Oh, that's strong.
Ugh!

367
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,830
I don't like it.
Okay, to the ladders!

368
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,167
I'm already feeling a twinge.

369
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,252
Yeah, I-I feel something.

370
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,304
I don't feel like I
have to poop, though.

371
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,257
I feel weird.
I kind of feel crazy. Like, what is that?

372
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:48,011
That isn't a laxative,
is it, Frank?

373
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:49,730
Nope.

374
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,733
Welcome to Level 4,

375
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,101
horror.

376
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:08,482
Oh. What is this?

377
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,580
Wake up, guys. Wake up.
What's going on?

378
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,869
Hello, gang.

379
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,895
The keys to your cuffs

380
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,124
have been sewn
into your forearm.

381
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,045
Beside you are some tweezers

382
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,182
attached to a car battery.

383
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,924
Last team out of the room loses.

384
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:36,555
Frank, this is insane.
Let us out of here!

385
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,057
What are you doing?
Everything has to be based

386
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:41,110
on an existing board game!
That's the whole thing!

387
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:43,729
Oh, but it is, Dennis.

388
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,565
Ever hear of a game called...

389
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:48,367
<i>Operation?</i>

390
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,987
Oh, shit.

391
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,122
He's got a point.

392
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,540
Damn it.
Let's go.

393
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:01,163
- This game is totally insane!
- Don't give up on the game!

394
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,215
The game is fine!
No, no, no, no.

395
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,750
No, this isn't representative
of us...

396
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,585
Oh, God!
Oh!

397
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,387
Oh, I'm gonna stop!
I'm gonna stop!

398
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,423
No, I quit, too. I quit.
I can't do it.

399
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,591
- I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!
- Oh, God!

400
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,427
- It's just the bone.
- Charlie!

401
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:17,013
Oh, Jesus Christ, dude! Oh!

402
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,648
Oh! I think
you shit your pants, too.

403
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,934
Well, it was probably just the
laxative kicking in. It wasn't

404
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,187
a goddamn laxative, Charlie!
You just pooped your pants!

405
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:26,272
You guys quit! You quit

406
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,074
and we won the game!

407
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,658
Finally.

408
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:32,578
Finally, I won the game.

409
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,581
This is not what I signed up
for, you donkey-brained maniac!

410
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,283
Uncuff me!
Cool it, cool it.

411
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,785
Take it easy. I mean,
it's just a... it's just

412
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,170
a simple mind game.

413
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:42,922
No one had a key on 'em.

414
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:46,509
You know, I knew
they'd cave like bitches.

415
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:47,760
Hold on a second.
Wait a second.

416
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:50,096
Andy, did you just call him
"donkey-brained"?

417
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:52,965
Yeah. What? It's an expression.
What did you mean by

418
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,767
"not what I signed up for"?

419
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,685
Do you two know each other?

420
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:58,220
No!
No...

421
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:00,189
No. No.
No.

422
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:02,308
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait-- look at this, guys.

423
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,644
"Mattel" is spelled wrong on his
business card. That says "Matel."

424
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,646
I'm calling this number.

425
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:14,904
Welcome
to the home of Wolf Cola...

426
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,241
Oh, okay, Frank, so you clearly

427
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:21,494
just hired this guy
so that you could win

428
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,245
and put your stamp on the game!

429
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,331
No, there's no truth
in that at all. No.

430
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:26,749
Tell 'em, Andy.

431
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:33,222
What?!

432
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,891
It was all bullshit?
It was just a hoax?

433
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:38,060
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait,

434
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:39,929
wait, wait...
Unreal.

435
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:43,349
So, then, if this isn't about
selling the game anymore...

436
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,117
Well, then it's about winning.

437
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:50,022
Okay, here we go.

438
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,274
Public humiliation.

439
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,776
Are you ready, Charles?

440
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,078
Yes... Okay,
I'm-I'm in a sort of...

441
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,364
Dude, are you-you
sure you're okay?

442
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,200
You might've lost a lot of blood from
digging around in there with the tweezers.

443
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,335
You know. He's around it. Yep.

444
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,421
Here we go. Okay, then here we go.
You have to withstand

445
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:08,040
one full minute
of intense berating.

446
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,925
Okay, that's, uh, lights on.

447
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,343
He's ready. "Lights on," he said.
"Lights on." Okay.

448
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,512
But it's not gonna be from us.

449
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:17,466
Nope. Not from us.
It's from<i> her!</i>

450
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:19,435
Ow! Ow! You're holding my hair!
Okay, hold on a second.

451
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,688
Ow, let go! Oh, my God, that hurt so much!
Goddamn it.

452
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,473
Okay, well, you know what, it
was supposed to be a big reveal.

453
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
I had a whole thing planned.
What's wrong with you?

454
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,881
You know what, of course you
ruined it-- you are the worst.

455
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,279
Oh, my God, what is that smell?

456
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:33,899
Is that poop? Did you poop
in your pants, Charlie?

457
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,951
Yeah.
Oh, gross.

458
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,787
That's so disgusting.
This is gonna be so easy.

459
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,823
No, dude, don't
listen to them, okay?

460
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:42,374
You can do this, Charlie.

461
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,076
If you can not cry
for just one minute,

462
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:46,629
just one minute,
we win the goddamn game.

463
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:47,630
Yeah, man.
You can do this.

464
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,048
Are you ready?
Yeah.

465
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,633
Okay, yeah.

466
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,468
All right. Okay. Okay.
Here we go.

467
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:54,170
I can do...
Ready, get set, go.

468
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,388
Charlie Kelly, I have been
waiting for this

469
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:57,806
for a long time,

470
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,892
you poop-smelling

471
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:01,844
trash person.

472
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,512
Your face,
it looks like a troll!

473
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,564
You look
like you have troll features!

474
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,433
You stalked me! There's
something wrong with you!

475
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:10,102
Your brain is broken!
I hate you!

476
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,438
I hope you die! And I hope you go to hell!
Three! Two!

477
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:14,173
And I hope it burns!
One!

478
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:16,108
You did it! You did it!

479
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:17,710
Holy shit!

480
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,479
<i>We won!</i>

481
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,281
<i>Charlie?</i>
<i>Come on, buddy, you can do it.</i>

482
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,532
Come on, wake up,
Charlie, wake up.

483
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,251
I don't know
if he's gonna wake up.

484
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,786
I don't either.
Charlie, come on, buddy.

485
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:29,538
Charlie, are you okay? Charlie...
Charlie, open your eyes.

486
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:33,092
Charlie? Oh. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. There he is.

487
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,260
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
We thought we lost you, buddy.

488
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:36,295
We thought we lost you.
Hey.

489
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:39,215
Oh, my God. Oh, man. What happened?
God... like, all I remember is,

490
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,634
like, winning the game
and then passing out.

491
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,435
Is that how you remember it?
Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,638
No. No, no, you
cried like a baby.

493
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,023
Yeah, pretty much right when
the waitress started talking,

494
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,808
you cried like a little bitch.
Quite a bit.

495
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,777
Yeah. Yeah. You-you
must have been

496
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,812
hallucinating
from all the blood poisoning.

497
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,949
So... did you guys win?

498
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:58,817
Yeah. Big-time.
We always do.

499
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,704
So did you crush
our game pieces?

500
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,872
No. Oh, my God, Charlie, no.
Charlie, we weren't even thinking

501
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,374
about the game anymore.

502
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:06,542
No one was.
We were terrified for you.

503
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:07,708
With you in that condition?

504
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,161
Really? Oh, thank you.

505
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,154
Oh, thank you so much, guys.
Oh, God.

506
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:12,034
Are you kidding me?

507
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:15,134
That's, like, really, the
nicest thing you've ever done.

508
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,803
Uh, Dee, can you...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:20,556
Charlie, no,
we wouldn't have done that

510
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,174
with you... with
you in that condition.

511
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,642
Yeah. It-it...
No.

512
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,428
But now that you're
conscious, you know...

513
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,765
Dee, are you, uh,
all set back there?

514
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,151
Yep.
Okay.

515
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,773
Loser. Yeah!

516
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

517
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,530
Yeah! Yeah!

518
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:55,457
