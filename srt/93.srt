1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:04,341
- Okay, but now you make a right-hand turn...
- Make a right turn.

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:05,342
Okay, making a right.

3
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:08,225
You should pass three fuzzy
poles with blinking lights.

4
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:09,279
Those are traffic signals.

5
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:11,452
Okay. All right, wait a minute,
I haven't gotten there yet!

6
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:12,343
And, great.

7
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:13,580
You should be making a left turn here.

8
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:14,604
There's no left!

9
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:15,605
You don't know where I am, tape.

10
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:16,606
This ain't working, Charlie.

11
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:17,607
This ain't working.

12
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,609
You should pass three fuzzy
poles with blinking lights.

13
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:20,610
Those are traffic signals.

14
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,612
I passed the traffic signals!

15
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,615
You should pass three... It's stuck!

16
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:26,683
Charlie, I need you here!

17
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,785
This tape isn't working.

18
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:32,288
This is KPFN Public Radio.

19
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:36,840
Today, on <i>Do It
Yourself Gardening:</i> composting.

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,563
I'm sure many of you are wondering
what composting involves.

21
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:44,300
You should pass three fuzzy
poles with blinking lights.

22
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:47,904
Hate those poles and the blinking lights!

23
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:51,007
Make sure your
compost pile gets plenty of air.

24
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:56,201
- Now...
- Oh Sandra... you dumb bitch.

25
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:01,206
Wha...?

26
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:04,843
Charlie, what is
so hard to understand?

27
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:09,180
I believe that if I inseminated
the right woman, our seed could

28
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,750
potentially-- through an
X-Men-type genetic mutation--

29
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:14,486
create a son capable of bending steel.

30
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:15,487
Uh-uh.

31
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,489
That's completely insane.

32
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,090
Do you understand genetic
mutations at all?

33
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:21,092
Do you hear what you're saying?

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,728
I didn't cause any damages, Dennis.

35
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:25,731
Yeah, not to the exterior of my
car, but to the interior of my car.

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,732
My interior is ruined.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,168
Guys, so, I'm sitting at a red light,
at a dead stop, and Frank rams into me.

38
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:30,836
Out of nowhere!

39
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:33,071
And now he's saying he's not
gonna pay for the damages.

40
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:35,073
I mean, did you know
that the man cannot see?

41
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,141
I can see! I got glasses.

42
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:37,443
I just need new lenses.

43
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,778
The lenses are what make
the glasses work, Frank!

44
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:43,582
If you were driving around without the
use of sight, then that is completely

45
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,751
irresponsible, and you need
to pay for the damages.

46
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:46,384
Yeah.

47
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,587
None of the damages were my fault.

48
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,589
Well, it sounds like all of
the damages were your fault.

49
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,617
I mean, Frank, how are we
even talking about this?

50
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,226
Yeah, if you rammed into... He
ran directly into somebody else.

51
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:58,396
Dennis was eating a bowl of cereal.

52
00:01:58,465 --> 00:01:59,397
What?

53
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,600
He was eating a bowl of
cereal when I hit him, and it

54
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:05,403
spilled all over the interior,
and <i>those</i> are the only damages

55
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:06,572
to the car.

56
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:10,609
You were eating a... bowl of cereal?

57
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:11,242
Yes.

58
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,077
While you were driving?

59
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:13,645
Yes. It's not that crazy.

60
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,947
That's not what this is about.

61
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:17,916
Well, it's a little bit about that.

62
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,918
Yeah, there's a high spill
factor if you're driving...

63
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:21,553
Actually, it's a lot about that.

64
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,555
Come on, I don't
have to justify myself to you!

65
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,556
You know what I'm gonna do?

66
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:25,557
I'm gonna take you to court.

67
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,157
Fine. Fine.

68
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,159
Nobody needs to go to court here.

69
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:31,162
There's no reason we can't settle this
ourselves, like civilized adults.

70
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,232
No, we can't, Dee, so I'm gonna take
him to court, I'm gonna sue him,

71
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,933
and I'm gonna win.

72
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,068
Dennis, you don't want to
go anywhere near a court.

73
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,337
How many bench warrants for
sexual misconduct do you have?

74
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,107
I-I probably have... yeah.

75
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:46,244
Yeah. And, Frank, how many unregistered
guns are in your car right now?

76
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,278
A lot.

77
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:50,916
Ooh, I <i>like</i> where you're headed
with this, Dee, and, uh,

78
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:55,487
if I may, I think what you're proposing
is that we handle this little matter...

79
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,489
internally.

80
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:19,733
Sync & corrections by 

81
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,346
Okay, uh, okay okay okay.

82
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:28,599
I'd like to begin with my opening
statement, uh, if I could.

83
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:32,245
First off, uh, who is the
defendant in this matter?

84
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,246
That's not a statement.

85
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:37,916
All right, well, irregardless, uh, I would
like to know, as Frank's lawyer, who

86
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,818
I am persecuting or who I'm defending.

87
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,819
Yeah. Prosecuting.

88
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,456
Okay, let me just nip this whole
thing in the bud right now.

89
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,459
Stop treating this like it's a
trial, and like this is a courtroom.

90
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,226
Yeah, but the tables.

91
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,295
Yeah, but I was against that, too, okay?

92
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,230
Let's just present the facts
to each other, and then let's

93
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,831
decide as a majority who's in the right.

94
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,900
That being said, Frank
would be the defendant.

95
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,834
I'm not the defendant.

96
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,603
No, that implies that I am guilty.

97
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,471
He's right.

98
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,140
If anyone's ever accused of anything, I
automatically assume they're guilty.

99
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,141
You do, right?

100
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,143
I'm gonna make you the defendant.

101
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,812
Okay, and I'll make Frank the defendant,
and then we'll split it up after.

102
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,813
<i>You're</i> the defendant.

103
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,814
You aren't prosecuting him!

104
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,783
I'm finished! I'm finished.

105
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,152
Where have you been for
the last three hours?

106
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,588
I have been making... this.

107
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,022
What the hell is that?

108
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,257
It's the Trial Meter.

109
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,660
It shows how we each feel
throughout the trial.

110
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,029
Yeah, I made little gavels with
our names on it, and we can move

111
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,863
them accordingly.

112
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,201
And at the end, whoever has the
most gavels on their side wins.

113
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,769
It took you three hours to make that?

114
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,604
Yeah.

115
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,472
Mac, let me tell you something.

116
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,108
Nobody is gonna want to use
that because it's so stupid.

117
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,711
We are dealing with a serious issue here.

118
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,712
You imbecile!

119
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,713
Don't be an imbecile.

120
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,515
Okay, my property is at stake.

121
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,216
What are you doing?

122
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,217
W-Well, don't do that.

123
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,485
Look, okay, not that we're using
this stupid thing, but don't

124
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,655
start doing that because you're gonna...
I like what he did there.

125
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,457
I'm gonna go ahead and move my guy.

126
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,659
Why? Why? We haven't
presented any facts yet.

127
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:54,860
Yeah, okay.

128
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,464
Well, don't everybody start
moving their gavels over to the

129
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,534
side, we haven't even... well,
good, at least you have the

130
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,535
common sense to be on my side.

131
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,171
Well, as your representative in this
matter, I didn't have much of a choice.

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,172
My hands were tied.

133
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:07,841
N-N-No. No, no.

134
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,808
You're not... you're
not my representative.

135
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,809
I will be talking for myself.

136
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,713
This is an open and shut case,
and anybody who can't see that

137
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,748
is a savage and an idiot!

138
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,183
Okay, uh, I would like a
five with my client, please.

139
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,818
Oh, you want a five, counselor?

140
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,853
I'd like to take a five, yes.

141
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
All right, I'll allow it.

142
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,656
Stop talking like this is a
goddamn courtroom, please.

143
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:24,657
Oh, I'm the judge!

144
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,658
No, you're not.

145
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:26,659
Can I be the bailiff?

146
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,660
You are not anything!

147
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,361
I'll allow it.

148
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,362
No one is anything!

149
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,365
I will scratch everybody's
eyes out of their sockets!

150
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:42,775
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
collies, uh, my client Frank here isn't

151
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,711
really on trial today, you know.

152
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,012
Common sense is on trial.

153
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,750
And, well, common sense would
tell you that eating a bowl of

154
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,253
cereal while operating a car
is, well, it's-it's reckless.

155
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,888
It's moronic.

156
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:00,058
One might even call it... donkey-brained.

157
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,960
Donkey-brained?

158
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:07,800
Uh, it means to have the brains of a
donkey or a donkey-type creature.

159
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,969
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I
know what it means, guy.

160
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,539
But if anything, it's not
donkey-brained to drive around

161
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,809
with a bowl of cereal, it's
donkey-brained to drive around

162
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,611
without the use of your vision.

163
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,112
Oh. That's interesting.

164
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,749
So you do admit that someone who
makes foolish decisions could be

165
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,584
considered donkey-brained?

166
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,621
Uh... sure. Yeah, okay, fine.

167
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,755
I'll take it.

168
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,923
All right.

169
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,895
Uh, now, Frank, if I'm correct, when you
were a boy you were admitted into a...

170
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,764
mental institution.

171
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:39,765
Is this correct?

172
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,066
That's correct.

173
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:46,071
But soon after, it was discovered that I
wasn't mentally disabled, so they let

174
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,072
me go.

175
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,610
And, they let me go <i>with</i> the
proper paperwork, clearing me of

176
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,511
everything.

177
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,299
I would like to add into
evidence Article 1.

178
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,851
Uh, Mac, will you please
read this document?

179
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,152
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,955
"By the power of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

181
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,091
Reed Mental Institution hereby
decrees Frank Reynolds to not

182
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,695
have... donkey brains."

183
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,796
What?

184
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,199
What? That is an official document
that says "donkey brain" on it?

185
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,201
Well, it's written right
here in plain English.

186
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,203
Frank, would you like to
clear this up for everybody?

187
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,507
Well... all the kids in the
neighborhood knew I got sent

188
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:25,043
upstate, so they started calling
me "Frankie Donkey Brains," and

189
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,846
it was very traumatic.

190
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,448
So I got my mommy to drive me
back up to the loony bin, where

191
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:35,488
they signed this official certificate
exonerating me of all donkey brains.

192
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,890
Yeah, great. What does this
have to do with anything?

193
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,360
Uh, well, Dennis, if by your
own admission someone who has

194
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,663
donkey brains could be
considered reckless or moronic

195
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,501
or idiotic, and my client
Frank here has a state-issued

196
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,905
certificate clearing him of
having said donkey brains, then

197
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:59,812
I ask you this: do <i>you
</i> have any such certificate?

198
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,979
What?

199
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,149
Well, we don't want a donkey
on the road eating cereal.

200
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,185
We know <i>Frank's</i> not a donkey.

201
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:12,190
How do we know <i>you're</i> not
a donkey-brained man?

202
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,693
Why would I have a certificate?

203
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,529
You <i>don't</i> have a certificate?

204
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,531
N-N-No, the burden of proof is not on me.

205
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,533
The defendant will answer the question.

206
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,534
The defendant?

207
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,568
I'm not the defendant!

208
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,438
Just answer the question.

209
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,439
No.

210
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,440
No further questions.

211
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,441
Oh!

212
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,508
You got to be kidding be.

213
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,443
Because of that?!

214
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,510
You don't have a certificate.

215
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,513
I mean, you know, what else are we
supposed to... What in the...?!

216
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,514
You may have donkey brains.

217
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,515
I don't know.

218
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,518
No one can prove that they're not
donkey-brained except for him.

219
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,687
I just... I wish you had a certificate.

220
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,221
Oh, bullshit!

221
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:52,264
Frank... would you like a glass of wine?

222
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,298
Yeah, all right.

223
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,367
Huh? Why not have a glass of wine?

224
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,370
I mean, after all... Oh!

225
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,371
Hey! Hey! Hey!

226
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,372
You can't do that!

227
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,774
Oh, I'm so sorry.

228
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:02,942
Oh, whoopsie, whoopsie.

229
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,811
See, I bashed into Frank
while he was at a dead stop.

230
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,813
That's completely my fault, Frank.

231
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,415
I will pay for <i>all</i> the
damages to your shirt.

232
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,084
Case closed.

233
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,320
Oh, well, when you put it
like that, you got me.

234
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,823
You know, I'm on Dennis's side
now-- he just convinced me.

235
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,092
Uh, hold-hold on one
second though, Charlie.

236
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,730
It occurs to me that Frank
assumed responsibility for a

237
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,765
potential spill the
second he took the wine.

238
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,766
Yeah, he's right.

239
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,767
I knew the risk.

240
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,770
So in this circumstance, it would
appear that Frank is at fault.

241
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,772
And therefore in the
car, Dennis is at fault.

242
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,773
I am on Frank's side.

243
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,774
Case closed.

244
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,776
I pushed... I mean, I pushed him!

245
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:38,777
Boom! You nailed it.

246
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:39,778
You know what?

247
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,780
Mac just made the most
credible argument of all.

248
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:42,781
Hold on a second!

249
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:43,916
Hold on, Charlie. Credibility?

250
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,918
You're interested in credibility?

251
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,988
I would like to call
my next witness: Mac.

252
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,497
So, Mac, you seem to be pretty locked
into Frank's side at this point, right?

253
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,500
And your opinion, it carries a lot
of weight around here, doesn't it?

254
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,501
Oh, absolutely.

255
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,003
I'm a tastemaker around here.

256
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,538
Pretty much what I say goes.

257
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,873
And I've decided that
Frank is the winner.

258
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,543
Yeah. And, Charlie, you find
Mac's arguments to be fairly

259
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,444
credible and convincing?

260
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,648
I do. Yeah, he makes a
lot of good points.

261
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,018
He's a good judge, and...
he's an even better bailiff.

262
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,954
So if you find Mac's arguments
to be so credible, why

263
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,223
is it that you disagree on
the subject of superhumans?

264
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,526
But we don't...

265
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,662
What? What does this have
to do with the case?

266
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:34,132
Well, Mac, if your character isn't
credible, then are your arguments?

267
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,903
Strike this line of questioning
from the record, please.

268
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,904
Uh, overruled.

269
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:39,905
Let her continue.

270
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,841
Mac, do you or do you not
believe that you could create a

271
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,079
superhuman race of strongmen through
genetic mutation and evolution?

272
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,081
What difference does that make?

273
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,484
If you believe something that insane,
then how could you be our tastemaker?

274
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,552
How could we believe anything
that you have to say?

275
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,868
I'm gonna ask you one more time:

276
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:00,559
do you or do you not believe
that you can create a superhuman

277
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,896
race of strongmen through
genetic mutation and evolution?

278
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,436
Uh, no.

279
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,771
That's ridiculous, Dee.

280
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,839
What are you talking about?

281
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:14,907
What are you talking about?

282
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,909
You were just... you were just
telling Charlie this morning all

283
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,944
about the... "Oh, have you seen
<i>X-Men?"</i> and "My seed," and...

284
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,946
Well, I was joking with Charlie.

285
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,948
That could never happen
in the real world, Dee.

286
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,950
That's, like, a comic book thing.

287
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,719
He's credible! He's credible.

288
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,053
I win this case.

289
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,054
It's an open and shut case.

290
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,457
Shit, Dennis, that was...
Wait-wait-wait a minute.

291
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,393
Mac, why don't you believe that?

292
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,461
Huh?

293
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,529
Well, I'm just wondering.

294
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,398
Why don't you believe that you
could pass down a gene that

295
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,369
would eventually evolve
into a race of supermen?

296
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,437
Why?

297
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,439
Well, that's a silly question.

298
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,474
Because evolution doesn't
exist, of course.

299
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,475
I'm sorry?

300
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,477
Oh, could you repeat
that again for the room?

301
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,747
Because evolution is
bullshit-- it's not real.

302
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,315
Goddamn it! Recess!

303
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,646
What? What? What? What?

304
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,395
You got to sway Charlie.

305
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,187
You got to make yourself credible again.

306
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:06,188
What did I do?

307
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,924
We got to stop with this--
your insane, crazy beliefs.

308
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:11,193
You got to tell them that
you believe in evolution.

309
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,594
Oh, come on, Frank.

310
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:13,662
That's ridiculous.

311
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,097
We got to get Charlie to stop
thinking you're a lunatic.

312
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,500
Look, Deandra's gonna side
with Dennis-- that's a given.

313
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:19,601
You want me to win?

314
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:22,471
Okay, Frank, for you, I will
make myself credible in

315
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,473
Charlie's eyes again, so you can win.

316
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,210
Just give me 15 minutes.

317
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:31,046
I'm finished, guys!

318
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:32,047
Jesus Christ.

319
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,048
I'm finished.

320
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:35,984
Now, this is all about making
myself credible in your eyes

321
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:41,657
again, and I'm gonna do that by
admitting that evolution... is a lie!

322
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,959
God damn you, Mac!

323
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:46,127
Yes, please do, Mac.

324
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,664
Now, as you can see, this
is the Evolution Meter.

325
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:52,133
And I've put God, the creator of
everything, on the right side.

326
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,403
And evolution... on the left.

327
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:56,505
I went ahead and put you guys
all on the fence, 'cause of

328
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,707
course you're gonna... Actually, no.

329
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,809
Let's start where I would start.

330
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,644
No matter. I'm righteous.

331
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:06,682
I'm not gonna stand here,
present some egghead scientific

332
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,884
argument based on fact.

333
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,586
I'm just a regular dude.

334
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,187
I like to drink beer.

335
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:13,221
You know, I love my family.

336
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,223
Rock, flag, and eagle, right, Charlie?

337
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,224
He's got a point.

338
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,225
No, he doesn't.

339
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:18,226
What?

340
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,261
See, Charlie?

341
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:21,830
These liberals are trying to
assassinate my character.

342
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:23,665
And I can't change their mind.

343
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:26,067
I <i>won't</i> change my mind,
'cause I don't have to.

344
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,603
'Cause I'm an American.

345
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,239
I won't change my mind on
anything, regardless of the

346
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,341
facts that are set out before me.

347
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,678
I'm dug in, and I'll never change.

348
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,213
Mac, look.

349
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,241
You're wasting our time.

350
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:42,217
You're not gonna get us to
not believe in evolution.

351
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:43,619
And why is that?

352
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:49,024
Because the smartest scientists in the
entire world all agree that it's real.

353
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,961
I'm glad you brought that
up, because, Mr. Reynolds,

354
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,465
science... is a liar sometimes.

355
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,034
Oh, boy.

356
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:02,137
This... is Aristotle.

357
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,540
Thought to be the smartest
man on the planet.

358
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:07,208
He believed that the Earth was
the center of the universe,

359
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:10,078
and everybody believed him,
because he was so smart.

360
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:15,050
Until another smartest guy
came around, Galileo, and he

361
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:18,286
disproved that theory, making
Aristotle and everybody else on

362
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:21,590
Earth look like a... bitch.

363
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:27,729
'Course, Galileo then thought
comets were an optical illusion,

364
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:31,800
and there was no way that the moon
could cause the ocean's tides.

365
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:35,070
Everybody believed that
because he was so smart.

366
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:39,908
He was also wrong, making him
and everyone else on Earth look

367
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:42,010
like a bitch again.

368
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,181
And then, best of all... Sir
Isaac Newton gets born, and

369
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:48,951
blows everybody's nips
off with his big brains.

370
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,119
'Course, he also thought he
could turn metal into gold, and

371
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:56,358
died eating mercury, making him
yet another stupid... bitch!

372
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,661
Are you seeing a pattern?

373
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:00,762
No.

374
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,201
Mr. Reynolds, these were all the
smartest scientists on the planet.

375
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:09,170
Only problem is, they kept being <i>wrong.</i>

376
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,772
<i>Sometimes.</i>

377
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,809
<i>This is insane, you fool.</i>

378
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:16,344
<i>I'm a fool because I have
more faith in the saints that</i>

379
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:17,613
<i>wrote the Bible?</i>

380
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,616
<i>Yeah, because you just read
the words of a bunch of guys</i>

381
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:24,185
<i>that you never met, and you just
take it on faith that everything</i>

382
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:25,621
<i>they wrote was true.</i>

383
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:26,622
<i>Hm.</i>

384
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,624
<i>And what makes you think what
your scientists are writing is</i>

385
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:29,958
<i>any more truer than my saints?</i>

386
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:33,128
<i>Because there are volumes of proven data.</i>

387
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,230
<i>Numbers. You know, figures.</i>

388
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:37,399
<i>Th-There are fossil records.</i>

389
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,967
<i>Oh, fossil records.</i>

390
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,202
<i>Ah! I didn't even think
about the fossil records.</i>

391
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,037
<i>I guess I'll concede.</i>

392
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:44,973
<i>Oh, wait, uh, one more thing
before I do, Mr. Reynolds.</i>

393
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,876
<i>Have you seen these fossil records?</i>

394
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,078
<i>Have I... huh?</i>

395
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:52,748
<i>Have you pored through the data yourself?</i>

396
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:54,016
<i>The numbers? The figures?</i>

397
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,084
<i>Well, no. I'm-- no.</i>

398
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,485
<i>Oh.</i>

399
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:58,854
<i>Interesting.</i>

400
00:15:58,922 --> 00:15:59,855
<i>So let me get this straight, Mr.</i>

401
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,023
<i>Reynolds.</i>

402
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,026
<i>You get your information from a
book written by men you've never</i>

403
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,193
<i>met.</i>

404
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,729
<i>And you take their words as
truth, based on a willingness to</i>

405
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:13,368
<i>believe, a desire to accept, a leap of...
of, dare I say it?</i>

406
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:16,237
<i>Faith?</i>

407
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,239
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

408
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:20,341
<i>Look, I mean-- I don't even know
how I'm supposed to respond to</i>

409
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:21,176
<i>that.</i>

410
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:23,244
<i>Like... oh, come on.</i>

411
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:25,881
<i>That is a... that's a false equivalency.</i>

412
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:27,943
<i>Just answer the question, Mr.</i>

413
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:29,885
<i>Reynolds.</i>

414
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:33,188
<i>Sure. Yeah, okay.</i>

415
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:35,223
<i>I rest my case.</i>

416
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,792
<i>Well, that got me.</i>

417
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,061
<i>Frank, do you want to, uh... Put me over.</i>

418
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:39,895
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

419
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:40,729
<i>What?</i>

420
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,464
<i>Well, we're going on the fence.</i>

421
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,265
<i>I mean, that's a shadow of a doubt.</i>

422
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,101
<i>You actually don't believe
in evolution anymore?</i>

423
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:46,935
<i>I don't know.</i>

424
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,036
<i>He created a reasonable doubt.</i>

425
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:50,538
<i>He makes you sound like a
stupid, uh, science bitch.</i>

426
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:51,539
<i>Yeah, he got you good.</i>

427
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,141
<i>Eh... oh, my God.</i>

428
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,013
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

429
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,135
What-What are we even talking about?

430
00:16:58,255 --> 00:16:59,801
How did we get on evolution?

431
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,054
This is not about evolution.

432
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:03,924
Well, it became about that when
you attacked Mac's character.

433
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:07,594
Yeah, like they did in the O.J. trial
to that hero cop, Mark Fuhrman.

434
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:08,428
Right!

435
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,263
Okay, let's just get back on track here.

436
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:12,032
I would like to make
my closing arguments.

437
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,033
N-No, no, no, no, no.

438
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,434
This has gone on long enough.

439
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:19,039
And by the way, Dee, why the hell do you
give a shit about any of this, anyway?

440
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,607
You don't know?

441
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:23,610
You can't think of why I might
like to set a precedent of

442
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:27,347
responsibility for when
someone's car gets destroyed?

443
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:31,118
No.

444
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,353
Anybody else? Anybody?

445
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,521
I... I can't really think of anything.

446
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,689
Can you think of anything?

447
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:37,624
I'm blank.

448
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:38,759
Not ringing a bell for me.

449
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:43,363
You guys have destroyed every
single car that I have ever owned!

450
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,699
And we've never had so much as a
conversation about it, much less a trial.

451
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,368
A whole trial!

452
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,736
Are you making that up?

453
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,571
Isn't this... What is she talking about?

454
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:52,572
Are you sure that happened?

455
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,774
Oh, you sons of bitches.

456
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,642
Oh, you goddamn sons of bitches!

457
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,078
I am going to destroy everything you own!

458
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:58,912
Ooh.

459
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,813
'Kay, you know what?

460
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:00,747
I'm gonna end this.

461
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:01,648
I'm gonna end this!

462
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,150
Oh!

463
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,085
I still vote for Dennis.

464
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:07,087
All right, well, I'm still for Frank.

465
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:07,921
Yeah.

466
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,991
And I am actually gonna go to the fence.

467
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,225
What?

468
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,059
God.

469
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,094
Oh, goddamn it!

470
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:15,122
We're nowhere with this.

471
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,063
All right, okay, guys, settle down.

472
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,965
I think if we've learned
anything today, it's that, you

473
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,902
know, we can't just take
things based on faith.

474
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,471
Only seeing is believing, right?

475
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,639
Let's take this to the streets.

476
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:27,640
Thanks, guys.

477
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,474
Yeah, man. No worries.

478
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,309
Have a good one.

479
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,143
See you later.

480
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:30,977
Have a nice day.

481
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:31,812
Bye bye.

482
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,082
Okay, here's the deal.

483
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,151
Dennis, if you can drive to
your apartment and back without

484
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,420
spilling a single drop, Dee,
your precedent is set, and

485
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,687
Frank, you pay for everything.

486
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:42,488
Fine.

487
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,323
Good.

488
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,025
Okay, and Frank, if you can
drive to our place and back

489
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,927
without getting in an accident
with me giving you directions,

490
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,029
you can continue to drive as
long as I'm in the car with you.

491
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:49,963
Deal!

492
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:51,131
All right.

493
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:54,467
On your mark. Get set. Go!

494
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,702
Did he say it was a race?

495
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:56,536
No.

496
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,470
Why are they running?

497
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,505
I have no idea.

498
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:00,373
All right, steady.

499
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:01,208
Steady as she goes.

500
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,042
I'm going straight.

501
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:02,876
Beautiful.

502
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:03,745
No, beautiful stuff.

503
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:04,544
This is the best.

504
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,313
Yeah. Dee, uh, please prepare
me a bowl of cereal.

505
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,314
Yup.

506
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,215
What are you doing?

507
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,884
We got to see for ourselves
how reckless this is.

508
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:12,853
And you hold it in one hand
and drive with the other.

509
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,686
Interesting.

510
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:14,520
Yeah, I know.

511
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,556
Pretty mind-blowing stuff, isn't it?

512
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,860
Then I stop at a stoplight, and,
once I'm stopped, and everything

513
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,329
is safe... take a bite.

514
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,163
All right, here we go.

515
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,032
Hold on.

516
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:25,665
Make a... make a left right there.

517
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,499
Make a what?

518
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,334
Uh-huh. Go left.

519
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,301
Make a left.

520
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,135
Right.

521
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:29,970
Right?

522
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:30,803
No!

523
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:31,671
Make up your mind!

524
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,505
Deandra, shut up!

525
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:35,742
Well, dude, now that we're
alone, you can admit it.

526
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:39,980
I mean, I swayed you on
evolution a little bit, right?

527
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:43,350
Well, I...

528
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,851
Ah!

529
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,079
That's crazy! That is insane!

530
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:46,853
How do you hit me again?

531
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,720
It was Deandra's fault.

532
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:48,554
What?

533
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,223
She gave me the wrong directions.

534
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,057
This way, that way!

535
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,825
Guys, it was actually
pretty cut and dried.

536
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:53,933
It was Dee's fault.

537
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:55,921
I was trying to give directions
and she interrupted me.

538
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,640
***

539
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,417
***

540
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,372
This is your fault?
This is perfect.

541
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,111
Guys, we were all here to witness it.

542
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:05,132
It was Dee's fault, she'll
pay for the damages.

543
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,034
Absolutely. She should, yeah.

544
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:06,868
That's it.

545
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:07,702
Don't you dare.

546
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,844
No, it was-- oh, you
know, I have an idea.

547
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,452
Should we have a trial?
Me and Charlie?

548
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:11,614
- Kind of just had a trial.
- Too many trials.

549
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,499
Can't have a trial for every person.

550
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,781
Let's just have her pay for
it and be done with this.

551
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,068
All right, that's it.

552
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:17,902
N-no, no, no!

553
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,134
What are you-- no, because
Charlie was giving the-- I was only--

554
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,682
Goddammit!
