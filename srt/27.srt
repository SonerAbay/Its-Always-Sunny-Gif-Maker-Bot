1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:04,380
So he's in the law house, right...

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,923
Oh, please stop talking.
Just let me finish my story.

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:10,085
Describing an episode of Law and
Order in full detail is not a story.

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:13,597
No, it's so good. First of all, I
think I could be a really good lawyer.

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,895
I'm better than Sam Waterston,
I'll tell you that much.

6
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:18,299
You want to be a lawyer? Don't you think
you should know how to read or write?

7
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:22,305
Objection. Hearsay. That's lawyer talk.
That's the kind of stuff you have to do.

8
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:24,705
That serial killer killed
another woman last night. Really?

9
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:30,646
Yeah. It says here he's targeting
young, attractive blondes.

10
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:33,912
Okay, that's it. I'm not closing
the bar by myself anymore.

11
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:37,284
Why? What are you worried about?
You don't fit the description.

12
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,414
I fit the description. No,
no. Young, attractive...

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,823
I fit the description. All right.
Well, first of all, you're too big, Dee.

14
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:44,828
You're like a... You're
like a female Larry Bird.

15
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,659
There's too much of you.
There's not too much of me.

16
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:49,165
He would never finish the
job. He'd get the job done.

17
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,259
He'd spend his whole night hacking and
sawing. Then he still wouldn't be done.

18
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,737
He would open his box of tools and say,
"What tools am I gonna use for this?"

19
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,969
He could use normal tools. He'd look at
that pile of bones and flesh and say...

20
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,977
"How many people have I murdered
tonight?" "How is this just one person?"

21
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:05,141
Mm-hmm. Well, guess
what. You're Larry Bird.

22
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:07,741
That's okay, 'cause Larry Bird's an
excellent player. He's an awesome player.

23
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,014
What's up, bitches?
Hey yo!

24
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,953
Hey. This guy,
he got laid last night.

25
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,753
What? No, I didn't. Yeah,
you did. You didn't come home.

26
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,317
Yes, I did. You're wearing the same
clothes you were wearing yesterday.

27
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:19,989
That's what you were wearing
yesterday. These are different clothes.

28
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:22,794
Where'd you get those
scratches on your neck? What?

29
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:24,926
You got scratches on
your neck. No, I don't.

30
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,163
Oh, let me see.
No. What?

31
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:29,934
I gotta take a piss.
I don't have any...

32
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,532
You guys are... Huh?

33
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:36,038
Well, that was weird.
Wow.

34
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:39,140
He's been acting like that a lot
lately. What's gotten into him?

35
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:42,118
Serial killing.

36
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:18,249
If I'm gonna prove that Mac is guilty,
I gotta apply a little pressure.

37
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,553
I'm gonna get a chain saw.
A chain saw?

38
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,890
You can't just torture someone
'cause you think they're guilty.

39
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:26,555
Oh, don't give me that liberal bullshit.

40
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:29,259
Mac is not the serial killer. He's
not smart enough. He's a dumb person.

41
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,267
And dumb people are not
capable of serial killing.

42
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:34,998
Oh, yeah? What about the scratches
on his neck? I got a hunch about this.

43
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,472
You got a hunch? Frank's got a
hunch. Let's just convict him.

44
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:41,103
Let's carve our best friend to pieces with a
chain saw based on a hunch. Jesus Christ, Frank.

45
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,670
Dee, why don't you and I use
a little textbook psychology?

46
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,615
And that'll lead us to the
real serial killer's doorstep.

47
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:48,743
Are you all gonna go
against me on this?

48
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,947
Sorry, Larry Bird. Stop trying
to use the Larry Bird thing.

49
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,547
I don't know. Shh.

50
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,251
What are you guys talking about?

51
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:57,351
Nothing.
Nothing.

52
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,295
Okay, I forgot about this thing
that I gotta do, take care of.

53
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:03,765
I was thinking about it in the bathroom. And
I figured I should just go deal with it now.

54
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,395
So I'm just gonna go deal with it
now. I guess I'll see you guys later?

55
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,200
Okay, bye.

56
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,730
Oh, if I prove that he is guilty...

57
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:14,744
I am gonna torture
the shit out of him.

58
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,793
Hey, you.
We need to talk.

59
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:38,427
I don't understand. I
thought we talked about this.

60
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,596
We did. It's just that my
friends are getting suspicious.

61
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:44,266
And I cannot have them find out
that we are dating again. Why not?

62
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:49,473
Because of your... Oh,
God. Situation down there.

63
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,913
You mean my penis? Well, you
don't have to say it out loud.

64
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,110
I told you.
I'm getting rid of it.

65
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:57,279
I know. But when, dude? I feel like
I've been putting a lot of time in here.

66
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:00,188
Soon. It takes time. Look,
I know that it takes time.

67
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,192
I've been reading up
on the subject.

68
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,752
But maybe we should just
take it easy until then.

69
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,594
Because of the penis?
Oh, boy. There it is.

70
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,600
The penis.
Yes. Because of the pen...

71
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,932
Okay, listen.
Here's the deal.

72
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,472
I feel like we make out, and
it's great. I mean, really great.

73
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,031
But then things start to get
hot and heavy and you scratch me.

74
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,703
Which is cool. But you're
really strong, and it hurts.

75
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:25,238
And sometimes... just
sometimes... I bump up against it.

76
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:28,774
And I... I just can't
handle that.

77
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:32,016
Really? Because you seem
like you can handle anything.

78
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,023
I mean, with that body.

79
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:39,859
Well. Yeah, I mean, physically, sure.

80
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,661
I mean, I guess I can handle
pretty much any situation.

81
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:47,033
I mean, I do...
work out. So...

82
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,004
You sure do.

83
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:54,070
I don't know. He's
been in there a long time.

84
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:56,545
You think he's chopping up bodies?
He's not chopping up anything.

85
00:04:56,614 --> 00:05:00,550
He's not a serial killer. Hey, man. What'd
I tell you about bringing that chain saw?

86
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:02,586
Hey, you want to take
a picture with it?

87
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,848
No. We're on an invest...
Do you have a camera? Yeah.

88
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:07,356
Oh, yeah. Absolutely then.

89
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,655
Yeah. All right. How's this
look? Does this look cool?

90
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,854
Hold it closer to your
face and look really crazy.

91
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,692
Like I'm killing somebody?

92
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,732
Let me start it and get my
tongue... Put your tongue there.

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,530
There he is. There he is.
Oh!

94
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,003
We got ourselves
a serial killer.

95
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,937
No, you don't have anything.
That's inconclusive, Frank.

96
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,840
Look, look. He's guilty as sin.
Look at him. He's sneaking around.

97
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,901
You gotta have hard evidence.
You don't have any hard evidence.

98
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,437
I'll tell you what you do have. You got a
camera. So let's snap one off, all right?

99
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,449
Okay, like this?
Okay, right.

100
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:35,451
Put your tongue closer
to the blade.

101
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,556
Dennis!

102
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,751
Dee. What the hell
are you doing?

103
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,760
Get outta here. You're
gonna blow my cover.

104
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:45,591
This seems extraordinarily dangerous.

105
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,597
Dee, that is the point
of being here.

106
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:50,691
This is the area of the highest
concentration of murders by the serial killer.

107
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,067
I know. That's why I feel like a sitting
duck out there. You volunteered for this, Sis.

108
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:57,733
If you recall, I didn't want to use you
as the bait. You do not fit the profile.

109
00:05:57,808 --> 00:06:01,209
I fit the profile, Dennis! That's the right
attitude. Now pull these out or something.

110
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,145
You need to look sexy for this guy.
Otherwise, he's never gonna... Come on.

111
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:07,241
I just feel like this is a very inappropriate
outfit for how cold it is out here.

112
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,252
Is it cold out here?
It's freezing!

113
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,880
I have a down jacket on, a wool blanket.
It's a very toasty situation I got back here.

114
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,949
Get back out there, tiger. You
can do it. I believe in you.

115
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,893
Oh, Mac?

116
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,957
Are you in there?

117
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,837
We're clear, Charlie.
Come on.

118
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:29,930
This is an illegal search, Frank.

119
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,407
What's the decorating motif
of this place... prison cell?

120
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,274
I'm pretty sure you need a
warrant to be doing this, buddy.

121
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:38,509
What... Why are you wearing
those gloves? Fingerprints.

122
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:41,642
You think I want some Jew lawyer
crawling up my ass in six months?

123
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,085
Objection.
Extremely racist, man.

124
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,749
The guy's innocent, all
right? You're poking around...

125
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,985
but there's no point to it 'cause
you're not gonna find anything.

126
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,121
Oh!
And Bingo was his nameo

127
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,324
The Human Anatomy.

128
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,266
He's got a half
a chapter highlighted...

129
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,429
on the removal
of human genitalia.

130
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:05,942
Hey, Frank, what guy hasn't done some extensive
research on his own genitalia? All right?

131
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't say "you," buddy,
because I woke up...

132
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:11,213
to you doing some pretty
frantic research last night, pal.

133
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:14,683
We could go tit for tat on that
one. So you better drop that subject.

134
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:18,654
All I'm saying is that the book doesn't
mean anything. You got no evidence!

135
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,657
You got no case, Frank.

136
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:24,456
It stinks, that stuff. This
stuff is Drakkar Noir, man.

137
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:35,229
Damn, girl. Who you with?
Oh.

138
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:39,299
I think you got the wrong
idea. I'm not with anybody.

139
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,401
Word? Well, lookee here.

140
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,042
Maybe if you get up off that crack rock,
you can come and be Pepper Jack’s best ho.

141
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:49,211
Oh, no. I'm not
on any crack rock.

142
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:52,346
I mean, one... Okay, one time
I was hooked on the crack rock.

143
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:56,325
But that was because I was trying to
get on welfare and fail a drug test.

144
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,021
But that stuff, you gotta be
careful because it'll mess you.

145
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:02,327
Why are you asking? Do
you have some on you?

146
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,732
Hi. Uh, sir, I'm sorry. We're trying
to conduct a little business here.

147
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:09,796
Ho. Pepper Jack’s trying to conduct some
business here too. You with this cracker?

148
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:13,742
No. Well, technically, we drove here
together. But I'm not with anybody.

149
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:15,403
You heard it.
Your bitch chose me.

150
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,346
See now, Pepper Jack, I feel
like we're miscommunication.

151
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,747
Bitch, you speak
when spoken to now.

152
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:24,686
Oh, no. No. Sir, you know what? We're
just gonna get out of here. Dee, let's go.

153
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,553
Whoa. Now you're not just gonna come
here and take Pepper Jack’s best ho.

154
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,718
You want this ho back,
Pepper Jack needs to get paid.

155
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:32,854
Pepper Jack, are you serious? Do
Pepper Jack look like he playing?

156
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,057
I don't think Pepper Jack’s playing.

157
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,861
I feel like Pepper Jack isn't playing
either. No, Pepper Jack is not playing.

158
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,868
In fact, Pepper Jack about to cut
somebody. Oh, please don't cut.

159
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,064
Oh, no cutting. That's not
necessary. All right, how much?

160
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,076
Well, what you got? I don't know.
Seven bucks and a stupid thermos.

161
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:50,136
Is that Fraggle Rock?
Yeah.

162
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:54,048
Oh, Pepper Jack love Fraggle Rock.

163
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,053
Listen, I feel like we've been
going about this the wrong way.

164
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,783
I mean, you can't just jump
into the mind of a serial killer.

165
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,052
I feel like you need
to walk in his shoes.

166
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:06,324
Right. We need to go deeper. We need
to eat, breathe and sleep serial killer.

167
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:10,094
Go through all of the steps that this guy
would in order to understand his thoughts.

168
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,725
Yeah. Okay, what's the first step?

169
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,635
Here's what I think. If I was
gonna start mass murdering people...

170
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:18,004
I feel like the first thing
I would do is pick a victim.

171
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,067
Right. We need a victim. We need to
find somebody who we would want to kill.

172
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,737
Mm-hmm.
But who?

173
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,747
Here you go, Dee.
Thanks.

174
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,943
And shithead.
Hope you burn your tongue.

175
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,350
Sit down. No. What the
hell is wrong with you?

176
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:39,453
What is wrong with me? What the hell
is wrong with you? I saw you last night!

177
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,226
You did?
So you admit it?

178
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,699
Yeah. Don't ever admit it,
Mac! Don't ever admit it!

179
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,998
It makes my job that much
harder. All right, look.

180
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:49,767
You gotta quit this thing,
buddy. I tried, dude. I tried.

181
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,708
But it's like a drug. I just get wrapped
up in the moment and boom, it just happens.

182
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:56,473
I don't care what your sick and twisted
reasons are. I don't want to hear it.

183
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,276
Who else knows about
this? Nobody. Just her.

184
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,681
Well, that's good. She won't be a
problem. She ain't gonna tell anybody.

185
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:03,982
But I gotta tell you, buddy.
Frank's onto you. Frank knows?

186
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:06,022
Well, he's sniffing
around. Oh, goddamn it.

187
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,719
When the time is right, he's gonna come
at you, and he's gonna come at you hard!

188
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,318
Here's what you gotta
do. You gotta deny.

189
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:15,194
Deny. Just deny it. Just deny
it. Deny, deny, deny, deny.

190
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:17,200
You just deny it.
Deny it to the end.

191
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,032
If you deny something, it means it
never happened. It never happened.

192
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:22,402
You gotta promise me
something here, buddy. Uhhuh?

193
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:24,407
You gotta stop.

194
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,137
Well, okay. That's gonna be
a little bit of an issue, man.

195
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,145
I don't know if I can
promise that. Are you serious?

196
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,704
I want to stop. I just...
Okay. Hey, man. Hey, hey.

197
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:34,444
Shh, shh, shh. We're gonna
get you the help. All right?

198
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:38,215
But in the meantime, you gotta give
me the time to, like, build your case.

199
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,587
You know? To... To
help your defense out.

200
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:45,859
Like, you know, I
gotta do my thing. And then...

201
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,191
And then I do some moves.

202
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,065
Yeah. I'm into it.
Okay. Yeah, all right.

203
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:56,368
What the hell does that have anything
to do with what we're talking about?

204
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,374
Lawyer stuff. It's a great
show. Are you gonna help me?

205
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:01,070
Yeah, man.
Are you wearing my Drakkar?

206
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:04,478
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Accusations.

207
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,482
Well, it's just...
Those are no good.

208
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,790
It's my favorite...

209
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,485
I'm telling you, Dee, this is a
bad idea. No. We need killing tools.

210
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:19,054
But you're not using your head.
This is serial killing 101.

211
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,760
You don't buy anything that
can be traced back to you.

212
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,064
We're not buying anything.

213
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:27,368
My neighbor Gary works here. He
is desperately in love with me.

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,240
We need killing tools, he needs me
to smile at him every once in a while.

215
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:33,779
We're gonna take whatever we want for
free. There's gonna be no paper trail.

216
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:36,110
That works. I wonder if
they have painter's overalls.

217
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:38,878
How come?
Well, my guy's a painter.

218
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:42,581
I go from house to house gaining
very easy access to my victims.

219
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:44,850
And more importantly,
gaining their trust. Uhhuh.

220
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,256
Who's your guy?
Psycho clown.

221
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,261
Psycho clown?

222
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,730
Yeah. I like to dress like a clown when I
slaughter. Now help me grab some killing tools.

223
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,700
The serial killer's probably
not a psycho clown, Dee.

224
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,896
Whoa. What do you think
of these gardening shears?

225
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:02,806
I like those gardening shears very
much. But do they cut through bone?

226
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,868
Oh, yeah. That's a good
question. Hey, Gary.

227
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:10,109
These shears, they
do cut through bone, yes?

228
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:12,879
Uh, yeah. I guess.
Yeah, I thought so.

229
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:16,046
Gary, my brother and I,
we're gonna take these shears.

230
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:19,319
But we're gonna take 'em
on the hush-hush. What?

231
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,383
For free.

232
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,952
Oh, okay.
Okay.

233
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,399
Get back to work.
There you go.

234
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:31,403
Oh, man. That guy's a
pussy. Yeah, spineless.

235
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:34,099
Hello.

236
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,606
Messy.
Too messy.

237
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:37,108
Very messy.

238
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,939
Do you mind if my associate and
I ask you a couple questions?

239
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:45,109
Don't feel compelled to
answer any of them, Mrs. Mac.

240
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:48,119
I will be recording this conversation.
You want a fresh cigarette?

241
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,348
Here, here.
Yeah.

242
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,357
I notice you like cherry pie.

243
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:55,360
Cut the chitchat. My client's clearly
a busy woman. Ask your questions.

244
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:58,829
In your opinion, ma'am,
was your son an angry child?

245
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:00,866
Objection. Leading.

246
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:05,267
Did he ever exhibit any hatred
toward women? Irrelevant questioning.

247
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:07,806
Do you think he was raised in a
dysfunctional family? Move to strike.

248
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,934
Wait a minute. What are you talking
about? Ask her fair questions!

249
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,377
I'll give you one question, and
then we're out of here! One question.

250
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,642
You think your son's
out there killing people?

251
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:19,378
Yeah.
Oh!

252
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,647
That's it, lady!
Damn it!

253
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,552
You just buried me!
Chain saw serial killer.

254
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:28,959
You buried me. That's my
whole case! I'll be in touch.

255
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:33,895
I can't believe you actually dressed like a
clown. You're gonna draw so much attention.

256
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:36,161
I thought we were
getting into the killer's shoes.

257
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:38,863
But the killer's not a psycho clown,
Dee. That's only in movies... stupid ones.

258
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,873
Oh, really? John Wayne
Gacy? He was a psycho clown.

259
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,933
He was an excellent one. Did
good work. Come on, Dee, that's...

260
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:47,878
Yeah, actually, you're right. He was
pretty... Okay, okay. Here she comes.

261
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:50,541
This is the fun part, Dee. This is
the part that we've been working up to.

262
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:53,016
This is what all the work has been
for. We're gonna follow our victim.

263
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:55,020
Uhhuh.
And then we're gonna jump her.

264
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:58,387
And then I'm gonna strangle her and
you're gonna chop her into pieces.

265
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,154
Okay, but what are we really gonna do?

266
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,788
Huh? We're not really gonna
kill her. What are we gonna do?

267
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:09,233
Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. That's
a bummer. Yeah, you're right.

268
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:12,601
Let's just follow her for a little.
We'll throw a good scare into her.

269
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:15,197
Figure out what to do later. That's
just not as much fun as actually...

270
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:19,734
No. No. I know. It's good
enough. Let's do this. Okay.

271
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:10,286
Oh, my God.
My eyes feel like fire.

272
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:13,093
Dee, if you hadn't been squeaking
around like a goddamn psycho clown...

273
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,033
she never would've noticed
us. No, this is not my fault.

274
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:18,161
Everything we do is
backfiring. We need a new plan.

275
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:21,434
No shit, Sis. But what's the
plan? What? We need a confession.

276
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:25,375
What the hell are you doing? I'm
spying. I'm spying on everybody.

277
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:29,175
And I got good news. I
know the killer is Mac.

278
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:33,275
I got hard evidence. I got
a confession from his mother.

279
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:35,843
Holy shit, Dee. You know what?
I just realized something. What?

280
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:38,254
I know who the killer is.
You do?

281
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:42,283
Yes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dee,
the real serial killer is Mac.

282
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,955
That's what I just said.

283
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,828
How did we not see it
earlier? I don't know.

284
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,094
Whatever! I got a plan.

285
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:52,001
We gotta set a trap. We're
gonna get a confession.

286
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:55,097
But first, we gotta
lure him in on the phone.

287
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:57,608
Hold that thought, Frank.
I just came up with a plan.

288
00:15:57,677 --> 00:16:00,544
Uhhuh. We need to set a trap
and get a confession from him.

289
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:04,447
Ooh, but first, we gotta
lure him in on the phone. Yes!

290
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:07,816
Are you shitting me? Now,
Dee, can you do a girl's voice?

291
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,084
Well, this was fun. Right?
Mm-hmm.

292
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:15,218
Now I'm gonna go. Uh,
same time tomorrow?

293
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,695
Well, maybe we could
go out or something.

294
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,823
You know, to a restaurant.
Or... Or to your bar.

295
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,031
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah,
that's not gonna work.

296
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:30,701
I'm getting tired of this. I feel like you're
afraid that people will see us together.

297
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,710
No. I don't care if
people see us together.

298
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:35,906
I just don't want them to think
that we're dating. We are dating!

299
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:39,509
I don't think it's too much to ask for you to
keep this quiet, considering your condition.

300
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:44,045
Look, it's not like I'm ashamed
of you. I'm ashamed of myself.

301
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,954
Well, it's over. I don't know
what happened, man, but it's over.

302
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,997
What's over? Did you go back?
Of course I went back, Charlie.

303
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:54,658
Damn it, Mac. I told you not to go back.
You're digging me a pretty big hole here!

304
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:57,760
It doesn't matter, because she
won't talk to me anymore, dude.

305
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:01,432
Well, that's very interesting. She
talks... When did you start hearing voices?

306
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,168
That could actually help us.

307
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:06,370
What's the I. D? Private.
Should I answer it?

308
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:10,541
Yeah. I'll allow it.
Go, go, go. Uh, hello?

309
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:15,053
Uh, okay. Uh, could
you hold on one second?

310
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,885
Some chick named Sandy. She said
we met at the bar the other night.

311
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:20,858
Speakerphone. Can you do it on
speakerphone for this? Yeah. Okay.

312
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,862
Hey, Sandy.
Uh, what's crackin'?

313
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,864
This is Mac, right?

314
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:30,198
Good-looking guy, great
sense of humor, really bulky?

315
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:32,396
Uh, more ripped.
Strike that.

316
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,063
Jacked.
Irrelevant.

317
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,732
Toned.
Exaggeration.

318
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,537
I work out.
I'll allow it.

319
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,771
Okay. Yeah, that's me.
Listen. I was thinking...

320
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:41,972
maybe you should come
over to my place tonight.

321
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:45,643
There's no one here.
I'm all alone.

322
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:48,118
Could you come take care
of me? I'll allow it.

323
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:51,020
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
I can take care of you.

324
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,218
Great. Then I'll see
you at my place. Great.

325
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:55,783
I'll see you tonight.
I'll allow it.

326
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:57,795
We got him.

327
00:17:57,863 --> 00:18:00,855
Let's get the video camera and get the
hell outta here. Where are we going?

328
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:03,128
To catch a predator.

329
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,531
Whose apartment is
this? My friend Gary's.

330
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:10,268
Gary the hardware store guy?
Yeah. He's, like, never here.

331
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,334
Why do you have his keys?

332
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,709
'Cause he asked me to water his
plants when he's out of town.

333
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,578
All of his plants are
dead. Well, I don't do it.

334
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,141
I'm gonna go oil my chain saw.
What?

335
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:23,416
Frank, we don't need the chain
saw. Is that what's in that bag?

336
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:26,856
Oh, we do. Because drawing
a confession out of someone...

337
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:29,895
is like doing a beautiful dance...

338
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:33,591
a beautiful dance
with a chain saw.

339
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:37,794
He makes less and less sense as the
days go by. I don't get it at all.

340
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,462
All right, let's set up.
Yep.

341
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:47,372
Gettin' laid tonight.
"Come on in. I am horny. "

342
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:49,505
Giddyap. Hello?

343
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:52,915
Sandy?
Hey, come on in.

344
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,976
Have a seat.
I made you some cookies.

345
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,454
I'm just in here
changing into my bikini.

346
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,457
Really? Can I come back?
Uhuh.

347
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,652
Oh. Got the wine coolers.

348
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:03,888
Yummy. Did you bring
any condoms?

349
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:07,160
Ooh, not really into the
whole condom thing. So...

350
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,701
Hello, Mac. How are you?

351
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,634
What are you doing, dude?

352
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,673
Why don't you have a seat, enjoy
a cookie, have some iced tea.

353
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,800
Okay.
Who are you here to see?

354
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:21,108
My friend Sandy.
Oh, Sandy. Sandy, huh?

355
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,479
Is Sandy a young,
attractive, blonde girl?

356
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,714
I have no idea. Uh, Sandy. Why
don't you come out here, please?

357
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:32,048
Oh. Why hello, Mac.

358
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,388
Not so young and
attractive, is she? What?

359
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,054
Must be a big disappointment.
What is going on here?

360
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:40,724
What were you planning on doing
to Sandy? What do you think, dude?

361
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,859
Well, according to this
phone transcript, Mac...

362
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:46,098
you were going to
"take care of her"?

363
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:49,835
Yeah. Take care of her. The Human
Anatomy. How about a little light reading?

364
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,878
What are you doing with my book?
You know where I got it, Mac.

365
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:55,004
Tie him up!
Come on, Frank.

366
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:57,515
Tie me up? Jesus Christ!
Get the camera away from me!

367
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,517
Before you go, I should tell you I'm...

368
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,952
I'm sorry, Mac. You can't keep running from
this thing. You gotta face this head on!

369
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:05,957
I'm gonna get you off this. Don't
be afraid to show me your ugly side.

370
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:09,085
All right. Put that away, Frank.
You don't need a chain saw.

371
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,095
You're talking to an innocent man.

372
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,961
All right, Mac. I'm gonna ask you
now 'cause I'm tired and hungry.

373
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,467
I want to go home. I want to wash
my hands of this whole stinking mess.

374
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:20,528
Did you or did you not snap into an
alternate and distinct personality...

375
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,871
causing you to go on a
serial killing rampage?

376
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:27,344
What? No.
What? Yes, you did.

377
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:31,042
You... All right, Mac. You're
crazy, right? You're a crazy person.

378
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,642
Sometimes you're two people. Let's
see the other guy. Let him out.

379
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,880
Let who out?
The serial killer, Mac!

380
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:38,048
Let the serial killer out!
I'm not a serial killer!

381
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:40,649
Then why all the shady behavior?
I've been banging the tranny!

382
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:43,126
I didn't want you guys to find
out. No. You're trying to...

383
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:45,095
What?
Ew.

384
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:47,098
Oh.
I don't even know how that works.

385
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,693
It's complicated. There's
a lot... She tapes it back.

386
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,737
Oh, really? Come on,
man. Oh, my God, man.

387
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,069
I've been reading up
and... Wait, wait, wait.

388
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,336
Dude, wait. So you're
not the serial killer?

389
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:00,139
No. I just won this case.
That means you're a free man.

390
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:03,704
You're not a serial killer. See,
when I came in... And I was doing...

391
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:06,512
You guys don't even get it,
do you? I'm gonna get a beer.

392
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:09,748
Dee, do you think this guy's
got any beer in his fridge?

393
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:13,280
No. There's a bunch of
severed heads in there. What?

394
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,920
There's about 15 severed
heads in there, I'd say.

395
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:22,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's heads in there.

396
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:24,761
There's a lot of heads in
there. A shitload of heads.

397
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:26,532
We're in the killer's apartment?
Yes!

398
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:28,539
Neighbor Gary?
Gary.

399
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,768
Oh, my God.
I don't know who Gary is.

400
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:33,107
Wait. Shh, shh, shh.

401
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,113
I think I hear keys.

402
00:21:42,354 --> 00:21:44,982
What are you people
doing in my apartment?
