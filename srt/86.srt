1
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:04,192
Oh, God!

2
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,764
Run!

3
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,164
Where are you guys?!

4
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:14,331
What's happening?!

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,264
Over here!

6
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,198
Over here!

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,332
Frank!

8
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,267
Where are you?

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:18,903
Frank!

10
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:19,770
Charlie!

11
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:20,837
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,439
Over here.

13
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,441
We're all here?!

14
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:25,176
We're all here?!

15
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:26,043
Guys!

16
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:28,577
Stop!

17
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,578
Stop where you are!

18
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:36,415
You four got some
explaining to do.

19
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:44,960
Sync and corrections by


20
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:07,024
I got 15 different wedding
guests out there with various

21
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,892
degrees of injury.

22
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:11,695
I got a groom--
face is half gone!

23
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,062
And I'm still missing a bride.

24
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:15,431
I don't know what happened back
there, but we are innocent.

25
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:16,465
We're completely innocent.

26
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,868
Yeah, well, you four bozos are
the only people on the scene

27
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,636
that weren't invited.

28
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:22,771
So you can see how
bad this looks.

29
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,407
Now, who is
Mr. Dennis Reynolds?

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,877
Oh, that's me.

31
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,247
Hmm, hello, Dennis.

32
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,150
Those are some interesting
marks on your neck.

33
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:35,217
Let me guess.

34
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,588
Ex-wife's getting remarried,
you get a little jealous.

35
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,593
Get your buddies together, you
decide to break up that party.

36
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:48,998
So you crash the wedding, get a little
tipsy, things take a violent turn.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,933
No, no, no, look.

38
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,436
That is the exact opposite
of what I wanted to happen.

39
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,240
I wanted to make sure that
that wedding happened!

40
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,243
Why is Maureen getting married
in the middle of the woods?

41
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:00,978
I don't know.

42
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,646
Some people find the
woods romantic, I guess.

43
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,248
And why get married
on Friday the 13th?

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,015
It's a monster day.

45
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:06,683
I don't know and I don't care.

46
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,486
I just want to make sure
the wedding happens.

47
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:09,486
I'm tired of paying alimony.

48
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:10,420
Well, we got your back, bro.

49
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,255
Don't worry about that.

50
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:12,956
I don't need you
to have my back.

51
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,326
Three people crashing a wedding--
it's gonna make a scene.

52
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:17,027
Why couldn't you just
let me do this alone?

53
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,529
Just don't like getting
bussed up there.

54
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,098
I feel like we're
gonna be trapped.

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,832
I don't, I don't
like any of this.

56
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:22,967
Oh, no.

57
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:24,369
No, no.

58
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:25,703
I don't like this
place already.

59
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,305
This is a strange place, right?

60
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:28,640
I'm seeing a lot of bats.

61
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:30,041
Yeah, there's bats everywhere.

62
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:30,675
You know why?

63
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:31,776
'Cause it's Friday the 13th.

64
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,510
No, no, no, stop.

65
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:33,445
Will you stop with that?

66
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,213
It's not because it's
Friday the 13th.

67
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:35,981
We're in the woods.

68
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:36,715
Stop being paranoid.

69
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:37,683
Still, this is creepy.

70
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,851
I mean, who gets married
in a spot like this?

71
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:41,219
Oh, Jesus Christ!

72
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,654
You guys crashing my wedding?

73
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:43,288
Wait.

74
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,988
What?!

75
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,689
You?!

76
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,125
Wait, Liam, <i>you're</i>
marrying Maureen?

77
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:47,859
Big-time.

78
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,027
Don't be jelly.

79
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,862
What the hell is going on here?

80
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:51,629
What's your angle?

81
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:54,365
Oldest angle in the
book, my friend.

82
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,633
Love.

83
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,634
I don't buy this, okay?

84
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,503
I thought you were
in love with Ryan.

85
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,138
What's your brother
think about all this?

86
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,972
Ryan's dead to me.

87
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:01,573
Do you hear me?

88
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,677
He's dead!

89
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,348
So, I take it he
doesn't approve?

90
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,516
That's a negative,
Ronald McDonald.

91
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:11,820
Now, I'd ask you guys to leave,
but I'm just too damn happy.

92
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:18,362
See you bitches on
the dance floor.

93
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,399
I don't like this, okay?

94
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,202
This is a McPoyle-Ponderosa
wedding.

95
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,270
This is, this is bad.

96
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,338
Look, look, if you're gonna
be here, I need your support.

97
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,342
You need to help me make sure this
wedding goes off without a hitch.

98
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,944
Hold on. What made you think
this wasn't gonna happen?

99
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,249
Mac had heard there were some people
there who wanted to ruin the wedding.

100
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,551
Who?

101
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,218
Him.

102
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,453
Ah!

103
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,388
That is bullshit!

104
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,859
I was there to
support my buddy.

105
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:48,394
That was a swervy road.

106
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,095
Yeah.

107
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,129
What are you guys doing here?

108
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,230
Oh, my God, I knew it.

109
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,765
You're here to break
up this wedding.

110
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,899
What are you talking about?

111
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,868
I'm here to support my
friend, Bill Ponderosa.

112
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,136
I'm his AA sponsor!

113
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:58,870
Bullshit!

114
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,773
You two love the fact that I have
to pay alimony the rest of my life.

115
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,208
You love the power you have over
me with this financial burden.

116
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,611
You know what, Dennis, not
everything is about you, okay?

117
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,746
I am here to support Frank.

118
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,614
No, you two are here
to make a scene.

119
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,248
Oh!

120
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,085
If anybody's making
a scene, it's you!

121
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,953
Ow! Ow!

122
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,255
I just got tagged by a bat!

123
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:16,889
He got you.

124
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:17,489
I got tagged!

125
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,390
Suck out the poison, Dee!

126
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,425
I'm not sucking on your head.

127
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,058
Suck it out!

128
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,760
I'll give you $200,
you suck it out.

129
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,561
$200? I'll do it!

130
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,228
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

131
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,995
I'll do it for $200.

132
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,729
Suck it quick.

133
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,397
What are you...?

134
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,298
This is the kind of thing
that I was talking about!

135
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,966
Suck it harder!

136
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:28,666
Go home, please!

137
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,300
Suck it harder!

138
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:29,934
I got it.

139
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,668
Did you swallow it?!

140
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,468
Of course I swallowed.

141
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,269
Make yourself throw up!

142
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,671
Yeah, you swallowed the poison!

143
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,638
Get it out! Get it out!

144
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,272
Vomit! Vomit!

145
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:36,073
What are you doing?!

146
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,607
There is no poison from a bat!

147
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:38,642
No! You are gonna ruin this!

148
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,076
You're all gonna ruin this!

149
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,513
You all right?

150
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:44,615
It won't come, Frank.

151
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,249
Deandra.

152
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:45,850
Yeah?

153
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,685
Let's go break up this wedding.

154
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,586
Whoa, stop, stop!

155
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,922
So you <i>were</i> there
to break up the wedding.

156
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,791
Shit.

157
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,293
Did I just say that part?

158
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,094
Yeah.

159
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,863
Why did you want to
break up the wedding?

160
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,465
For all the things he just said.

161
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,499
That was accurate.

162
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,168
But it wasn't just our idea
to break up the wedding.

163
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,203
Not at first.

164
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:09,108
Last week, we had a
visitor at the bar.

165
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,954
They have to be stopped.

166
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:25,458
The McPoyle bloodline's been pure
and clean for a thousand years.

167
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,792
This marriage is
an abomination.

168
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:30,697
Now, when you say "pure and clean
," uh, you mean what, exactly?

169
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,832
Means we haven't bred
outside the bloodline.

170
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,400
For a thousand years?

171
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,869
Yeah.

172
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,137
That makes a lot of sense.

173
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,473
Dennis knows Maureen
better than anyone.

174
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:41,575
Only he can talk
her out of this.

175
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:47,147
The last thing Dennis wants to
do is break up this wedding.

176
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,183
But we do.

177
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,589
Okay, I brought a disguise.

178
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,523
Meh!

179
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:57,691
They're gonna know who you are.

180
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:58,759
This will work.

181
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,829
Now sneak me in so we
can go kill Maureen.

182
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:02,763
Kill?

183
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:04,364
Who said anything about
killing anybody?

184
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,666
No one's killing anyone.

185
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:08,268
We'll sneak you in to Liam so
you guys can talk or bang or

186
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,336
whatever it is you want to do.

187
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:10,236
Frank!

188
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:11,204
Frank!

189
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,438
Oh, thank God you're here, man.

190
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,773
I am not gonna make it.

191
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:15,240
I am itching to get blitzed.

192
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,942
Weddings are a big
trigger for me, man.

193
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,210
Why are you telling me this?

194
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,244
You're my sponsor, Frank.

195
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:19,878
Come on.

196
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,712
My support system.

197
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,579
Oh, right, right, right.

198
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,213
Of course.

199
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,881
So, do whatever
you feel is best.

200
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,717
Well, I feel it would be
best if I pounded a beer.

201
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,952
I'll support that decision.

202
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:28,619
I wish I could.

203
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,388
I mean, it's a dry wedding,
for God's sakes.

204
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,923
They're serving milk.

205
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,225
I feel like maybe I should do
some drugs then, you know?

206
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,026
That bad?

207
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:35,760
You earned it.

208
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,394
Yeah.

209
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,862
You do whatever you feel like.

210
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,763
You're a good person.

211
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,397
Frank.

212
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,031
Mm.

213
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:40,632
Cool, cool.

214
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,266
Thank you.

215
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:41,966
Thank you.

216
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,800
Diddly Dee.

217
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,434
Miss me?

218
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,202
Don't answer that.

219
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:44,803
All right.

220
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,738
Catch you guys later.

221
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,607
You're a bad sponsor.

222
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,241
Why?

223
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,143
I supported every decision
he wanted to make.

224
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:51,943
Stop wasting time!

225
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,811
Ow! God!

226
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,945
Let's go find Liam.

227
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,213
Shit!

228
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,414
Don't hit me.

229
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,508
Things have already taken a bit
of a dark turn, it would seem.

230
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,242
Yeah.

231
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,245
Okay, I need to get to Maureen
before Frank and Dee.

232
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,079
All right?

233
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,280
Oh, we'll come with you.

234
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,749
No, just hang back.

235
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:31,318
I got this, okay?

236
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:37,991
Dude, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

237
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:38,625
Yeah.

238
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,193
We could definitely
get laid here.

239
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:42,196
Huh? What?

240
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,801
Maureen, I need to
speak with you.

241
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:48,502
Dennis!

242
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,103
OMG, what are you doing here?

243
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:53,374
Well, uh, I have reason to
believe that someone is here to

244
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,376
destroy this special day for
you, so I'm sure to make sure

245
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:56,311
that doesn't happen.

246
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:57,879
That is so sweet, Dennis.

247
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,216
I also brought along some legal
documents, so if we could

248
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:02,517
just wrap this up lickety-split.

249
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,118
Legal documents? What?

250
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,222
Yeah, I realize my timing is a
little unorthodox, but, uh, I

251
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,891
figure what better way to make
sure your union is totally

252
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:13,561
complete than by having you sign these
documents that I need you to sign?

253
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:16,564
So if I can just get your
signature right here, and I'll

254
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,601
run up and get Liam's signature,
and this'll be on the books and

255
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:22,503
your wedding... Muh!

256
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:32,981
My Maureen, you've...
you've enhanced yourself.

257
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:34,750
Yeah, I got my tooth fixed.

258
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:35,984
I'm talking about your tits!

259
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,586
You big, giant new
titties, Maureen!

260
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:38,820
Why would you do that now?

261
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,756
Why not when we were
together when I could've...?

262
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,591
I told you I was
willing to change.

263
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,926
Yeah, but I didn't know
you meant physically,

264
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,227
that you would
change physically.

265
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,928
Why weren't you more
clear with me, Maureen?

266
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,996
All right, you know what?

267
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,096
I'm not gonna get distracted.

268
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,765
Just, just sign right here... Wait!
What are you doing in here?!

269
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,600
You can't see the bride
before the ceremony!

270
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:54,200
No, no!

271
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:54,734
Get out!

272
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,236
I just need her to sign this!

273
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,370
No! Get out of here!

274
00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:58,371
Wait, wait, wait! Maureen!

275
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:00,741
No matter what happens, you
got to go through with this!

276
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:01,174
Out!

277
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,008
Liam is your destiny, Maureen!

278
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,801
Oh, here he comes.

279
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,687
I didn't get it.

280
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,079
I mean, I'm so close,
I'm so close.

281
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,566
Do you know where Liam is?
Maybe I can get his signature first.

282
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:20,342
I didn't see him anywhere.

283
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:21,504
I'm sorry, but I got
to bring this up.

284
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:22,819
Things are getting
really weird.

285
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,147
I mean, check out Pappy McPoyle.

286
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,279
What is that all about?

287
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,549
I'll tell you what
that's all about.

288
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:37,018
Zombies.

289
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,019
Zombies?

290
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:42,457
I seen it once before in a rat,
and I seen it now in men.

291
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,728
Once one gets a taste for its own
kind, it can spread through

292
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,997
the pack like a wildfire.

293
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:53,368
Mindlessly chomping and
biting at their own hinds.

294
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,906
Nothing but the taste of
flesh on their minds.

295
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,874
You know the thing about a rat?

296
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,811
It's got life in its eyes.

297
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:05,348
Black eyes like a doll's eye.

298
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,319
Don't seem to be living at
all when it come at ya.

299
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,322
Till it bites ya.

300
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,892
And then the eyes
roll over white.

301
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:18,495
You don't hear nothing but the
screaming and the hollering.

302
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:19,597
What are you doing?!

303
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,532
Are you doing the speech
from <i>Jaws?</i>

304
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,267
<i>- Nah...
- Are you doing Jaws?</i>

305
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,102
<i>We don't have time
for this shit.</i>

306
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:26,903
<i>This is serious.</i>

307
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:28,237
<i>Look, it wasn't zombies, okay?</i>

308
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,271
<i>Really?</i>

309
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,105
<i>Yeah.</i>

310
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:34,042
<i>Then you explain
what happened next.</i>

311
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,282
<i>Okay, it's time to
get out of here.</i>

312
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:42,083
<i>I mean, look at that guy.</i>

313
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:46,188
<i>The McPoyles sprung from
my loins, fully formed!</i>

314
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,223
<i>One of them babies
tried to eat me!</i>

315
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:49,691
<i>I ate him first!</i>

316
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:50,759
<i>I ate him first!</i>

317
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,225
<i>Okay, I'm with Charlie.</i>
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

318
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,637
<i>Wait.
You guys are just gonna leave?</i>

319
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,594
<i>You're gonna, you're gonna go?</i>

320
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,407
<i>Yeah, we're out.</i>

321
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,412
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

322
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,300
<i>Yeah, go, go, go.</i>
<i>Yeah, get the hell out of here!</i>

323
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:03,305
<i>I didn't want you here
in the first place!</i>

324
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:17,620
<i>Yeah, I understand the McPoyle
bloodline's very strong.</i>

325
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:20,289
<i>Legions of us thousand sturdy
ones ruled this fine land.</i>

326
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,825
<i>Our bloodline was as pure
as the driven snow.</i>

327
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,495
<i>Mm-hmm. And then what happened?</i>

328
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,263
<i>Syphilis killed
about half of us.</i>

329
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:27,931
<i>Mm.</i>

330
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,999
<i>Mongoloidism got
most of the rest.</i>

331
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:30,567
<i>Right.</i>

332
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:31,067
<i>Yep.</i>

333
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,937
<i>Well, there's somebody inside who
wants to talk to you about this.</i>

334
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:34,671
<i>Mm?</i>

335
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,532
<i>Who's this guy?</i>

336
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,537
<i>Ryan!</i>

337
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,671
<i>We need to talk!</i>

338
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,273
<i>We'll leave you guys alone.</i>

339
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,095
<i>Let them hash it out themselves.</i>

340
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:13,024
<i>It'll bust up.</i>

341
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,166
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

342
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,668
<i>Holy shit.</i>

343
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:30,676
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

344
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:31,677
<i>No, no, no, Deandra!</i>

345
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,211
<i>What?</i>

346
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,313
<i>- No, you gotta stay!</i>
<i>- I don't have to stay.</i>

347
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:35,314
<i>You gotta finish this.</i>

348
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:36,682
<i>Uh, I'm not going to.</i>

349
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:37,783
<i>But we're not done!</i>

350
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,351
<i>Don't, don't go out there!</i>

351
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:40,953
<i>Deandra!</i>

352
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:43,821
<i>And we never saw Dee again.</i>

353
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:44,789
<i>Oh, no.</i>

354
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,289
<i>No.</i>

355
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,157
<i>We saw Dee.</i>

356
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,691
<i>Yeah.</i>

357
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:49,727
<i>Yeah, that's when the shit
started hitting the fan.</i>

358
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:50,895
<i>Oh, look, there's Dee! Dee!</i>

359
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:51,996
<i>Dee! Don't go down there!</i>

360
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:52,997
<i>Do not go down there!</i>

361
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,898
<i>We just got attacked by
a bunch of zombies!</i>

362
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,367
<i>Yeah, and the shuttle
bus is gone!</i>

363
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:57,968
<i>A zombie must have
stolen your car!</i>

364
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,869
<i>Your car is gone!</i>

365
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,004
<i>There's no way out of here!</i>

366
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,172
<i>There's no way out!</i>

367
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:03,975
<i>What are you doing?</i>

368
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,255
<i>She's infected! She's infected!</i>

369
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,493
<i>Liam? Liam?!</i>

370
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:23,529
<i>Liam! Hello, Liam?</i>

371
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:24,263
<i>Frank?</i>

372
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,265
<i>Hi, Dennis.</i>

373
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,432
<i>What did you do with Liam?</i>

374
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,233
<i>You're too late.</i>

375
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:29,568
<i>He's getting talked out of it!</i>

376
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,669
<i>Ha-ha-ha!</i>

377
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,603
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

378
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:32,170
<i>No!</i>

379
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:35,540
<i>Get out of my way, Frank!</i>

380
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,413
<i>Hey, man.</i>

381
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,749
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

382
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:48,852
<i>I'm begging Liam
for forgiveness!</i>

383
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,788
<i>It's time we move on.</i>

384
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,789
<i>Liam convinced me it's not</i>

385
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,291
<i>our blood that's being tainted.</i>

386
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:57,595
<i>It's us tainting the
blood of others.</i>

387
00:13:57,597 --> 00:14:00,364
<i>McPoyles will take
over the world!</i>

388
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,600
<i>Goddamn it! It backfired!</i>

389
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:03,634
<i>Wonderful.</i>

390
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:07,438
<i>And first step towards
that is signing this.</i>

391
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,373
<i>So Liam, if you'd just
sign right there, please.</i>

392
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,308
<i>Just sign right there.</i>

393
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,242
<i>Go ahead.</i>

394
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>You got it.</i>

395
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:15,246
<i>Stupid asses.</i>

396
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,250
<i>One down, one to go.</i>

397
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:20,285
<i>Nice try, Frank.</i>

398
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:21,653
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

399
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,088
<i>Get the hell out of the way.</i>

400
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,223
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

401
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,891
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

402
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:26,959
<i>We gotta get out of here.</i>

403
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,294
<i>I'm not going anywhere, Frank.</i>

404
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,663
<i>I'm not going anywhere till
I get that signature.</i>

405
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,167
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

406
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,005
<i>Hey, dude, check it out.</i>

407
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,306
<i>Remember when Dee, you know,</i>

408
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,741
<i>she sucked that bat poison</i>

409
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,143
<i>or whatever out of Frank's
head from the vampire bat?</i>

410
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:44,577
<i>Yeah.</i>

411
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,079
<i>That must be what turned
her into a zombie.</i>

412
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:49,582
<i>Why would a vampire bat
turn you into a zombie?</i>

413
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:51,250
<i>You're mixing up
your horror genres.</i>

414
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,285
<i>If anything, it would
turn you into a vampire.</i>

415
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:54,653
<i>Right or a bat, or a bat.</i>

416
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:55,654
<i>Or Batman.</i>

417
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:57,789
<i>No, a vampire turns
you into a vampire.</i>

418
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,223
<i>A zombie turns you
into a zombie</i>

419
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,693
<i>and Batman didn't get
turned into anything.</i>

420
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:02,693
<i>He just likes bats.</i>

421
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,929
<i>That can't possibly be
what Batman's about.</i>

422
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,031
<i>It's about a grown man who
dresses up like a bat?</i>

423
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,433
<i>And goes around solving
crimes and mysteries, yes.</i>

424
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,269
<i>These are Academy Award
winning movies.</i>

425
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,103
<i>This is serious stuff.</i>

426
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,871
<i>Well, you know the Academy,
Charlie, I mean...</i>

427
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:15,540
<i>I know the Academy
as well as anybody.</i>

428
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,507
<i>Sometimes, it's atrocious.</i>

429
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:17,508
<i>Well, to bring it all back</i>

430
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,609
<i>around, I think when Dee drank</i>

431
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,478
<i>the bat blood, that's
how she got sick.</i>

432
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,345
<i>Frank's blood.</i>

433
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:22,346
<i>Yes, but the bat juices.</i>

434
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,181
<i>You know, the bat
saliva, bat rabies.</i>

435
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,384
<i>No, no, it's not...
Bat rabies, I buy.</i>

436
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:27,718
<i>Bat rabies.</i>

437
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,819
<i>Yeah.</i>

438
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:32,856
<i>Like the...
Dude, we got to get out of here.</i>

439
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,912
<i>Yeah, go.</i>

440
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,438
Things had gotten
completely insane.

441
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,707
Dennis was trying to get the
signature from Maureen, but we

442
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,110
were just trying to get
the hell out of there.

443
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,313
Oh, my God.

444
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,748
What the hell?

445
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,249
Frank, what the
hell's going on?

446
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,084
Dude, we got to get out of here.

447
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:54,752
Where's Dennis?

448
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:55,853
I lost him.

449
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:56,954
You guys, I couldn't get it.

450
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,088
I couldn't get it.

451
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,156
She wouldn't sign it.

452
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,158
I couldn't get the
stupid bitch to sign.

453
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,159
She didn't sign?

454
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,160
This has all gone bad.

455
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,162
It's gone terribly,
terribly bad.

456
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,096
What did you do?

457
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,130
I did something bad.

458
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,533
I did something really, really
bad; guys, we got to get out of

459
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,669
here before everybody
finds out what happened.

460
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,270
Guys, I messed up.

461
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,772
I messed up bad.

462
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,008
All right, guys, let's
just make a break for it.

463
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,143
Which way?

464
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,979
One, two, three, go.

465
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,348
Come on, come on, this
way, this way, this way.

466
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,320
My face! My face!

467
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,188
My face!

468
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,323
One, two, three.

469
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,194
Oh, God!

470
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,228
Frank!

471
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,729
Over here, over here.

472
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,567
And then that's where you
picked us up, and honestly,

473
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,567
that's all that we know.

474
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:45,568
Yes.

475
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,838
So you're telling me that this
was a wedding full of zombies?

476
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,872
Yeah.

477
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,740
Well, bat rabies zombies.

478
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:51,574
Whatever.

479
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,643
There was weird incestuous
jealousies, we don't know what

480
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,410
was going on.

481
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:56,345
Bottom line, you got the wrong guys.
We're innocent.

482
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:57,580
Yes, we're totally innocent.

483
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:00,249
Marconi, we just picked somebody
up from the site who's

484
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,251
claiming to know what happened.

485
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,020
She was locked in a freezer.

486
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,088
Don't let her in here.

487
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,089
No, she's been infected.

488
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,192
I'm not infected,
you stupid idiots.

489
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,326
No one was infected.

490
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,695
Here's what happened.

491
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,000
Let them hash it out themselves.

492
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,101
It'll bust up.

493
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,402
Yeah.

494
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,738
I'm gonna go.

495
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,739
Deandra.

496
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:23,456
Dee's nuts.

497
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,857
What's the haps?

498
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,892
Here, have a sip, right
from the cow's titty.

499
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:27,560
You'll love it.

500
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:28,561
No, Bill, no.

501
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:29,695
I got to get out of here, okay?

502
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:30,362
Shit is going crazy.

503
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:31,063
No, don't go.

504
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:31,864
Party's just starting.

505
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:32,898
You got to have some.

506
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,732
Come on, try it.

507
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,734
Come on, it'll loosen you up a
bit, make your butthole hot.

508
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:38,804
How is drinking a glass of milk
going to loosen me up, Bill?

509
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,273
Well, I spiked the milk with
methylenedioxypyrovalerone.

510
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,107
What?

511
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,209
It's bath salts.

512
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:45,711
Yeah, yeah, it's like coke and
acid and meth all combined.

513
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:46,712
It's awesome.

514
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:47,713
Yeah, I get it.

515
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,882
So everyone here
is on bath salts?

516
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:50,883
Yeah, pretty much.

517
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,418
Oh, my God, just move.

518
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:55,955
Bath salts?

519
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,123
The drug that makes people
eat each other's faces?

520
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,427
Wait, that would explain
the zombie behavior.

521
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,697
Right, okay, Dee, so you were on
bath salts and that's why you

522
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:05,798
went all nuts on us.

523
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,932
Now it makes sense.

524
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:09,402
That is not why I went
nuts on you guys.

525
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,503
Huh?

526
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:13,172
I went nuts on you because of
what you assholes did to my

527
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:16,276
goddamn car!

528
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,480
Dude, when was the last
time you drove a car?

529
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:20,481
Don't worry about it, man.

530
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,083
I can drive; I remember how.

531
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:23,117
What?

532
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,318
No, no, no, no, no.

533
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,453
No, no, no, no, wait.

534
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,422
No!

535
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,162
What happened, dude?

536
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,163
What happened?

537
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,331
I forgot how to drive.

538
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,432
I forgot how to drive.

539
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:39,667
Oh, God.

540
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:42,203
Oh, look, Charlie, there's Dee.

541
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,438
Dee, don't go down that way.

542
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,140
We just got attacked by a
bunch of zombie people.

543
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:47,274
The shuttle's gone.

544
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,543
Zombies must have
stolen your car.

545
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,811
There's no way out of here.

546
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:55,516
Dude...

547
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,817
You sons of bitches!

548
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:57,952
You're gonna pay!

549
00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:59,053
You're all gonna pay!

550
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,454
I'll kill you!

551
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:01,955
You assholes, you'll pay!

552
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:02,957
No, we won't pay.

553
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,991
We never do.

554
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,060
Okay, well, there it is.

555
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,895
You know, there's
the whole story.

556
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,197
Ponderosa spiked the punch.

557
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,699
Somebody hopped up on bath
salts but Liam's face,

558
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,501
and, uh, case closed, you know?

559
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:14,669
Hey, good for you.

560
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:16,171
Good for us.

561
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:17,205
Bye.

562
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:18,640
Ba-da-bing.

563
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:19,875
Hey, whoa.

564
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:20,876
Sit down, slick.

565
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:24,113
Now that may explain some of the
shit that went on here, but it

566
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:26,582
doesn't answer the question
of the missing bride.

567
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:29,752
Since you're the one with
motive and the last one to be

568
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,488
seen with her, you're
my new #1 suspect.

569
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,357
No, no.

570
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,092
That's... I didn't murder her.

571
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,427
Then tell me what
happened to her!

572
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,429
I-I don't know.

573
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:40,530
I don't know.

574
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:47,904
Listen, if you confess, I
can help you, but you got

575
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:50,373
to tell me what happened.

576
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:55,412
Okay, all right, all
right, all right. Okay.

577
00:19:55,414 --> 00:20:00,951
Look, if I tell you what I did,
will you just help me, please?

578
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:02,285
Because I need help.

579
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:09,192
I'll see what I can do with the
DA, but I need you to confess.

580
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,563
Okay, fine.

581
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:15,297
Fine.

582
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,635
I-I was just going to see her to
get the final signature so I

583
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:22,538
could put this whole
thing behind me.

584
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:29,777
When I saw her...
Something bad happened.

585
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,482
Something very bad.

586
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,730
Oh, shit.

587
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:48,932
Oh, God, Maureen.

588
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,934
That was terrible.

589
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:54,136
Who did those tits?

590
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,404
The nipple placement is crazy.

591
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,006
- I love you, Dennis Reynolds.
- No, you don't.

592
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,241
I love you.

593
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,676
No, look, you're just gonna
sign these papers and we're

594
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,811
gonna be done with this, okay?

595
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:03,945
Never.

596
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,080
Let's run away together.

597
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,615
Oh, I'm gonna run away,
but not with you.

598
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:08,783
I'm gonna find you.

599
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:11,185
Oh, no, no, you're not
gonna find me, no, no.

600
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,253
We can't do this, Maureen.

601
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,088
Oh, no, please.

602
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,255
What have I done?

603
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,624
Oh, God, what have I done?

604
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:20,460
Oh, God.

605
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,195
Oh, God!

606
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,897
So all that shit about us
ruining the wedding...

607
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,366
And the zombies and the bath
salts and the blood...

608
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:29,635
It turns out you
blew it yourself.

609
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,103
Yeah, congratulations, Frank.

610
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:32,305
You win.

611
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:36,475
I'm gonna be paying alimony to that
crazy bitch for the rest of my life.

612
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,711
You expect me to believe this
woman's gonna throw her entire

613
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:42,614
life away just to sleep with her
ex-husband on her wedding night?

614
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:43,983
Huh?

615
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:46,952
Really?

616
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,553
Mr. Reynolds,
you're free to go.

617
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,556
What?

618
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:51,857
Why am I free...?

619
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:54,059
No.

620
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,194
Yes.

621
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:56,495
No.

622
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:57,897
Someone posted your bail.

623
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,565
Come on, silly head.

624
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,401
Let's go home and put this
whole adventure behind us.

625
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,136
No.

626
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:05,705
No!

627
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,340
No!

628
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:08,674
No, you got to help me.

629
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:09,675
What have I done?

630
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:10,677
You got to help me!

631
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,712
What have I done?
No! No! No!
