1
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:03,730
<i>Come on, hurry up, guys.
I want to get a good seat.</i>

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:04,741
<i>What do you mean you want to get...</i>

3
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:06,545
<i>Charlie, this is
a sexual harassment seminar.</i>

4
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,172
There are no "good seats."
Where are you going?

5
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:09,775
- Up front.
- This is so unfair.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,309
I mean, I'm not saying it
doesn't happen to, like,

7
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,911
loads of women all the time,

8
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,046
but I don't harass anybody,
so why am I here?

9
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,866
Because some Internet
warrior put Paddy's on a list

10
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:20,935
of unsafe places for women
and we can't have that, okay?

11
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:22,337
- Not in this climate.
- Right.

12
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:25,140
Ugh! You kids and your climates.

13
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,476
Back in the day,
I banged all my secretaries.

14
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:29,945
- Frank.
- That's the way you did it.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,547
You hire some girl with no experience,

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,499
you bang her, you promote her.

17
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,768
It's a win-win situation for everybody,

18
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:38,503
except for the wives.

19
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,773
Frank, modulate your volume, okay?
This is serious, okay?

20
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,576
The future of Paddy's depends
on us completing this seminar.

21
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,110
You guys should be really worried.

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,846
I'm not worried about anything, man.
If anyone should be

23
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,848
worried about weird shit with women,
it's you, bro.

24
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,466
The only reason we're here

25
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,668
is because you DENNIS'd someone probably

26
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:56,071
and she put us on the list.
We're only here 'cause of you.

27
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:57,873
Yeah, you perv. You happy now?

28
00:00:58,008 --> 00:00:59,341
- You happy?
- Happy?

29
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:01,343
You guys, this isn't about me.

30
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,077
I don't know if you noticed,

31
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,813
but women are on a little
bit of a rampage right now

32
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,165
and anyone could be
taken down at any moment,

33
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,801
so, you know, no,
I'm not happy right now.

34
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,503
Who could possibly be happy right now?

35
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,970
Hey-o!

36
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,973
Who's ready to party?!

37
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,575
♪ Time's up, time's up, time's up ♪

38
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,632
♪ Time's up, time's up, time's up. ♪

39
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,380
_

40
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:46,121
Hello. I'm Kate.

41
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,640
And I want to begin today
by addressing the reason

42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,242
that we're all here, the so-called

43
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,979
"Shitty Bar List"
of unsafe places for women.

44
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,513
Ah, yes. Uh, just a quick question.

45
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,098
How many points do we need?

46
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,967
I'm sorry, points?

47
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,501
Yeah, how many points
do we need to score

48
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,503
to get our name taken off the list?

49
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,706
Oh. No, there's no points.

50
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,107
Everything is graded by points, right?

51
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:07,308
I mean, otherwise, how could the Eagles

52
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,309
have won the Super Bowl, right?

53
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,245
All you have to do is
complete the seminar

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,981
and then your bar will have
its name removed from the list.

55
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,265
- There you go. Simple.
- Yeah, but our-our name

56
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,067
shouldn't even be
on that list 'cause, like,

57
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,471
we don't really have any history
of misbehavior at Paddy's Pub.

58
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,806
Well, I'm sure a lot of people
here today feel that way,

59
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,876
but I encourage you
to keep your minds open...

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,800
And your dicks in your pants.

61
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,414
Ma'am, that kind
of language is inappropriate

62
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,099
in a professional setting.

63
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,102
That's one of the things that
you'll learn in the seminar.

64
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,837
Uh, yes? Do you have a question?

65
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,764
Statute of limitations.

66
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,442
Okay. I'm just trying to get
through the introduction here,

67
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,178
but since you asked,
the federal law is 300 days

68
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:47,299
from the last act,
depending on the state and...

69
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,200
Sir, are you leaving?

70
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,535
- Frank!
- What?

71
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,204
They got nothing on me past '92, tops.

72
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,577
Hold on a second there.

73
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,475
Uh, pardon me, Kate, but, um,
aren't some states considering

74
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:00,946
doing away with the statute
of limitations altogether?

75
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,748
Some states like, uh, Nevada?

76
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,167
Yes, that's right.

77
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,618
Can they do that?

78
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,570
It's possible. Yes.

79
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:09,704
Nevada, huh?

80
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,907
Ah, it's getting warm in here.

81
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,643
Uh, got to make some calls. Shit.

82
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,980
You can continue now.

83
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,939
I promise you there will be
no further interruptions.

84
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,469
Right. We're gonna jump
right into the group work.

85
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,071
Half of you are gonna go with me

86
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,607
and the rest will be led
by my associate Alan.

87
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,141
Hello, everyone. I'm Alan.

88
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,809
Oh! Here comes the boss man.

89
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,345
- Finally, a dude.
- Yeah.

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,546
Yeah, okay, cool. He's in charge.

91
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,165
Uh, ma'am?
Could we go with Alan, please?

92
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,969
Actually, I think
we should split your group up.

93
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,905
That's, uh, that's gonna be
a lot harder for me

94
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,663
- to keep tabs on you guys.
- Don't worry, Dennis.

95
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,712
I'm gonna make you so proud.

96
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:49,444
I'm gonna work really hard
and get all the points and...

97
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:50,445
What is with you and the points?

98
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,913
There are no points.
We established that.

99
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:53,175
Well, that's how the Eagles
won the Super Bowl.

100
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:56,067
I know that's how the Eagles won the...
but this isn't the Eagles. Okay?

101
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,602
- This is a seminar.
- Go Birds, though.

102
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,538
- Oh, go Birds, go Birds.
- All right, fine, go Birds. Yes.

103
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,072
I know. Go Birds.
Get your hand off my knee.

104
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,674
Look, just sit here and do nothing.

105
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,075
<i>So, in this room</i>

106
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,943
we're going to be
talking about harassment

107
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,411
in the workplace.

108
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,081
And thank you to Elliot who's
agreed to play our boss.

109
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,434
I'll just need another
volunteer from the group.

110
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:13,768
- Oh! Oh! Alan!
- Alan! Alan! Alan!

111
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,303
- I'll do it.
- Uh, so, uh... - Alan! Alan!

112
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,906
Sir, would you mind
just jumping in for me?

113
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:18,882
Thank you.

114
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:23,111
Um, great. So just read from the script
and I'll jump in as and when.

115
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,380
"Good morning, boss."

116
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,400
"Hello, Johnson.
Have that report on my desk by 5:00.

117
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,604
- "Hey, did you see the boobs on that new intern?"
- And stop.

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,406
Now, can anyone tell me what
the boss did wrong there?

119
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,408
Yeah. He mumbled his lines.

120
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,809
I didn't believe a word
out of his mouth.

121
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,279
Uh, no, sorry. I mean in the scenario.

122
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,748
- He-he used vulgar language.
- That is correct.

123
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,690
B-But she didn't hear it.

124
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,768
This is just locker
room talk between guys.

125
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,037
Now, that's actually a
common misconception, okay?

126
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,638
Lewd comments can be
a form of harassment

127
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,774
even if directed to a third party.

128
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,909
But it's not for her. It's about her.

129
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,311
No, sorry. It's-it's actually,

130
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:57,913
it's the employee who's
talking to the boss

131
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,314
that is the one that was offended.

132
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,798
- What? Why?
- No, no, no, the employee

133
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,533
- would find it hilarious.
- Yeah.

134
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,402
I mean, not this guy
'cause the boss sucks at telling jokes.

135
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,737
Well, also, we really don't
know how funny the joke is yet

136
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,739
'cause we haven't seen the girl's boobs.
Can we see them?

137
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,942
Okay. Uh, let's... let's switch gears.

138
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,011
Maybe try a different scenario.
Thanks, gents.

139
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,812
Just, uh, uh, take a seat.

140
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,833
Um, so, uh, Mac,
what is it that you do at the bar?

141
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:21,569
- I am the head of security at Paddy's Pub.
- He's our doorman.

142
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,638
- No, he's just like our gay guy now.
- No, well...

143
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:25,640
Great. So, you check IDs.
That-that sort of thing.

144
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,909
- He should.
- Not once has he ever checked an ID.

145
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,644
- It's one aspect of the job.
- Yeah, he should.

146
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,647
Why don't you, why don't you hop
up here and we'll do a little scenario

147
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:34,332
that-that might be a
little more familiar to you.

148
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,267
- You are very tall.
- Yes, I am.

149
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,403
Now, should I take my
shirt off for the scenario?

150
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,738
Because I feel like
standing next to you,

151
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,205
they're not gonna be as intimidated,

152
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,941
but if I were to take my shirt off,
they would be intimidated.

153
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,141
I'm not in the scenario.

154
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,744
- We're good. We're good.
- Yeah, we're okay.

155
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,545
- We get it. We get it.
- That's him doing his gay guy thing.

156
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,547
So, uh, can we also
get a female customer?

157
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,015
- Ooh, yeah.
- A volunteer?

158
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,301
I will be the young, female customer.

159
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,437
"Young, female customer."
Great, good. Yes.

160
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,040
Okay. Well, um, just, uh,
do your job as you would normally

161
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,377
and I will, um, you know, jump in
if you cross over into any gray areas.

162
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,845
Okay. So what's my character?

163
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:05,446
Uh, you're just trying
to get into the bar.

164
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:06,847
Yeah, but why?

165
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,067
To get a drink, I suppose.

166
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,668
Why? I just drank
three beers on the way over.

167
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,804
You don't show up at a bar sober.

168
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,472
What a waste of money.
What are you gonna...

169
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,274
Just you're trying to get into the bar.

170
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,075
- I'm here for revenge.
- Okay. Sure.

171
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,610
Alan, what's my character again?

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,148
- You're the doorman.
- Right.

173
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,765
And how many drinks
have I had at this point?

174
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,167
You are... you're not in the scenario.

175
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:28,570
- I've had five.
- Okay. Marvelous.

176
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,572
Let's, uh, let's begin
whenever you're ready.

177
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,907
Excuse me, sir, have you...

178
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,845
- Whoa!
- Wow.

179
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,380
Jesus Christ.

180
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,715
Why did you do that?

181
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,600
Oh, well, well, she came at me,

182
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,536
- and it was sort of my instinct.
- That was amazing.

183
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,005
- That was great, right?
- You got me, like, a foot off the ground.

184
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,674
- A-Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. No, it doesn't hurt.

185
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,209
Did it-did it make you feel humiliated?

186
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,943
Did it make you-make you feel small?

187
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,746
That's what it is,
it made me feel teeny-tiny.

188
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,281
- Like Thumbelina.
- That's what I was going for. Thumbelina!

189
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,900
- That's the highest I've ever gotten.
- He's never gotten me that high before.

190
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,502
You're lucky I haven't
called the police.

191
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,969
Why-why would you call the police?

192
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,439
Oh, wait. H-Hold on.
Is that sexual harassment?

193
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,374
No, that is sexual assault.

194
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,909
- Really?
- Assault?

195
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,711
No. Dee, Dee. I did not assault you.

196
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:12,914
Please tell Alan that
I did not assault you.

197
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:16,484
Well, now that I've gotten a
little distance from the event.

198
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,101
Wha... No, Alan,
we do this kind of stuff all the time.

199
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,072
W-Charlie, would you tell him?

200
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,341
- He's gone.
- You do this all the time?

201
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,810
Y-You've got a big problem, all right?
She could press charges.

202
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,679
- Could I?
- No.

203
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,281
No! Dee. No.

204
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,633
- He just said I could, so...
- Oh, God.

205
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,569
It just, i-it...
did somebody turn up the heat?

206
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,817
Yeah, you sweating?
You sweating a little bit, Ronald?

207
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:37,805
- Yeah?
- No, it's just the climate.

208
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:50,401
The term "sexual harassment,"
it wasn't coined until 1975,

209
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,004
- by a woman named Carmita Wood.
- Carmita Wood. Oh. I'm sorry.

210
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,073
- Sorry.
- You really know your history.

211
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,475
- Well, this is important stuff.
- Oh, please.

212
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,811
- God, get lost, Dee.
- No way, I'm on a roll.

213
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,613
- So who could tell me...
Hey.

214
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,681
Is it sexual harassment when a man

215
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,568
constantly calls his
female coworker a bird?

216
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:10,238
That depends.
Is that a sexual innuendo of some kind?

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,373
Just a big dumb flightless bird.

218
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,643
Well, it's not very nice,
but it's not sexual harassment.

219
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,845
Nice try, you dumb bitch.

220
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,847
Um, Kate, if I may, yeah.

221
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,868
Um, federal law really only recognizes
two types of sexual harassment:

222
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,671
quid pro quo and hostile
work environment.

223
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,274
That is very good, Dennis.

224
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,742
- Thank you.
- No, no, don't do that.

225
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,010
This man is a monster. Believe you, me.

226
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,013
- What?
- He is the worst person I know.

227
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,415
Got to protect me on this, Larry.

228
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,767
I... start with the secretaries.

229
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,835
Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank. Pants.

230
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:43,171
I was sweating through my clothes.

231
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:44,973
It's this damn climate.

232
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,908
Sir, that robe is inappropriate.

233
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,443
- And I don't think...
- Hon, I'm on the phone, you see?

234
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:52,981
I don't know.
I bought her a Camaro. No...

235
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,666
You know I don't go Chinese.

236
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,134
I don't know why, I just don't.

237
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,269
Korean?

238
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,271
Oh, put her on the list.

239
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,739
I really did a number on her.

240
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:03,675
Yeah...

241
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,109
Why don't we take a break?

242
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,543
Got to get your shit together, Frank.

243
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,831
- You...
- Oh, I wish I was dead.

244
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,967
These vultures are
picking my carcass clean.

245
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:14,769
Whoa, Frank. Hey, stop talking.

246
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,504
- Where'd you get that robe?
- Upstairs.

247
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:18,306
I got to get one of them, man. Nice.

248
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,241
Whoa. Wait, Jesus, Mac.
What the hell happened to you?

249
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,511
I'm gonna be honest. The
first half has not gone well.

250
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,113
- You got exposed, too?
- Oh, yeah, he did. Big time.

251
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,066
He did a role-play thing, it went bad.

252
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,734
Wait, role-playing thing?
Y-You were supposed to do nothing.

253
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,802
I mean, n-now you're all
sweaty and twitchy?

254
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,404
Well, it's-it's so hot in here.

255
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,073
I mean, I feel like
they crank up the heat.

256
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,740
Oh, they cranked it up. I'm roasting.

257
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,744
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Which one of you just grabbed my ass?

258
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,215
Did you see that? Did you see...

259
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,900
T-that is a problem for us.

260
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:48,102
T-Their powers are growing. Okay?

261
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:50,571
Now, we got to start taking
this more seriously, okay?

262
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:52,840
Can you guys just go back in
there and do nothing, okay?

263
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,042
Just don't say or do anything.

264
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,644
<i>Can anyone tell me</i>

265
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,113
the two types of sexual harassment?

266
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,732
Oh. Oh, oh.
Uh, uh, flirting and groping.

267
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,535
No! Uh, groping and-and dick pics.

268
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,537
Yeah, I-I know that sending
dick pics is one of them.

269
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,273
You're kidding. Christ.

270
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,743
- I got to shoot some texts.
- Actually,

271
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,745
it's quid pro quo and
hostile work environment.

272
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,264
Would you please stop interrupting me?

273
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,833
- Ooh, ooh, burn.
- Please... And you.

274
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,702
Could you please sit down?

275
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:21,836
No, it's cool. I'm on your side.

276
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,437
There are no sides.

277
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,439
Shit, I just looked at her tits.

278
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,575
- Frank! Don't tell her that.
- Okay, don't panic.

279
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:30,178
A passing glance is
not sexual harassment.

280
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,113
Oh. I like your tactic here.

281
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,447
Get them all horny with your titties.

282
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:34,866
That's when they make their mistakes.

283
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,868
Ma'am, that's victim blaming.

284
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,137
No, I'm blaming Frank.
He's been staring at your boobs

285
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,738
this whole time. Still doing it.

286
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:42,440
Frank!

287
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,077
What? I'm not allowed
to like things anymore?

288
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,880
- It's a compliment.
- How is that a compliment?

289
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,432
Well, they're not<i> that</i> great.

290
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:53,100
Make her feel good.

291
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,568
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't let them get to you.
- Okay...

292
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:56,170
Okay? Your tits are fine.

293
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:57,905
<i>Okay, everybody,</i>

294
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,973
if, uh, you could take a seat, please.

295
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,644
So now what we're gonna do is, uh,

296
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,380
imagine a-a hypothetical scenario,

297
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,448
uh, based right here in Philadelphia.

298
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:10,774
So, uh, i-imagine a-a woman,
we'll call her "the waitress,"

299
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,270
who works at a local coffee shop.

300
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,139
Now, i-in this particular instance,
this waitress

301
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,675
is being harassed by
one of her customers.

302
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,477
He's following her home from work, uh,

303
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,613
digging through her trash
and calling her repeatedly,

304
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,765
until she complains
to her boss about it.

305
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,634
Now, the boss does nothing.

306
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:29,704
Can anyone tell me who's
legally at fault here?

307
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,839
Ooh. Wow, what do you think, Charlie?

308
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,841
I-I think The Waitress is.

309
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,643
Y-You know, 'cause,
for-she doesn't realize

310
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,978
that, like, true love
is in front of her stupid face.

311
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:40,114
- Well...
- Why would she say that's an assault?

312
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,133
Hold on a second.
Now, this is just a-this is just

313
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,402
a hypothetical, uh,
scenario that he's painting.

314
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,270
He's not getting
the whole big picture, right?

315
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,139
- Well, of course, it's a hypothetical.
- I know, but maybe

316
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,808
she, like, only thought like she
wasn't into him, but then, like,

317
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,609
15 years later,
when she needed a baby, like,

318
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,412
really bad,
and she'd been in and out of, like,

319
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,414
- a women's shelter, he banged her.
- Sorry.

320
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,833
That-that doesn't mean that
the customer didn't harass.

321
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:01,835
All right, well then,
I think all of the customers' friends

322
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,237
harassed her, too,
because they all banged her.

323
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,572
- I mean, he did.
- That's true.

324
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,240
Oh, well, don't bring me into th...

325
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:08,376
This is a hypothetical scenario.
I'm not involved.

326
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,511
- Neither are you.
- She also did hand stuff to Mac.

327
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,513
She did. I-It wasn't very good, though.

328
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,599
All right, look, are you trying
to tell me that no matter what,

329
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,934
it's always just gonna
be the customer's fault?

330
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,204
It is, in fact, the boss's fault.

331
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,206
The boss.

332
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,208
Well, that makes sense.
I always hated Seth.

333
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,276
- He's a real creep.
- Well, you don't know his name

334
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,012
because this is hypothetical,
and he didn't say t-that...

335
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,814
Well, it doesn't matter anyway,
'cause she just said

336
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,198
what I-what I did to
her wasn't harassment

337
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,699
because Seth did it to her.

338
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,035
Sorry. I...
Can I just make this very clear?

339
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,570
Okay? What the customer did
was harassment.

340
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:38,239
- Right.
- Yes.<i> If</i> it were you.

341
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,840
And so, take in the information,
but don't take it personally.

342
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,642
Uh, yeah, technically, don't,
like, I get, like, a free pass

343
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,945
and stuff, 'cause I mean,
I was molested.

344
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,779
Ah... W-Well, now,
actually, that is true.

345
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:47,181
He did get molested by his uncle Jack.

346
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,733
His-his uncle Jack got
to him pretty good.

347
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,201
- No, Uncle Jack never molested me.
- Oh.

348
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,802
- I dodged him.
- Oh, no, he got you. He got you.

349
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,804
- He got you big time.
- You weren't there.

350
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,273
- You wrote a whole play about it.
- Yeah, you did write a play.

351
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,675
- I got molested by Dee.
- What?

352
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,211
What? Oh, c-that's ludicrous.

353
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,879
No, it's true. Like, a couple years ago,

354
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,681
she banged me,
and I didn't want to do it.

355
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,033
- There you go.
- Wait, wait. You had sex with Charlie?

356
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,434
- Oh, God.
- You had sex with Dee?

357
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,770
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,772
We, okay, it was a mistake.

359
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,441
- Yeah, I'll say.
- I-It... I regret every second of it,

360
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:14,976
- but it was consensual.
- It was not!

361
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:16,910
I totally wanted her to stop, and, like,

362
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,514
I was very intimidated
by her larger frame.

363
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,365
- Oh, yeah, I can see that. Yeah.
- So, you know.

364
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,400
I have a petite frame. I...
i-it's a Thumbelina frame.

365
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,336
- I don't... Not to me.
- Y-You didn't tell me to stop.

366
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,850
Yeah, and I kept saying...

367
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,155
And you're like, "Shut up!
Stop talking! Be still.

368
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,542
"Let me do my thing.
I can't, I can't get off

369
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,944
with you moving and talking and shit."

370
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,279
Oh, shit. Yup. That's ringing a bell.

371
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,835
- Jesus, Dee. Ugh, God.
- All right, but yeah.

372
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,967
Either way, It does...
I can't molest you, you know?

373
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,436
It doesn't work that way
'cause I'm a woman and you're the man.

374
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:43,971
Right, right? Back me up, girlfriend.

375
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,041
Actually, a woman can sexually
harass and even rape a man.

376
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,375
Is that what happened here?

377
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,778
Actually, maybe.

378
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,180
No, no, no, no. You don't,
you don't just throw around

379
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:55,265
the-the "R" word, Kate. It's hot, right?

380
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,534
Yello?

381
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:00,271
What? Then find her through
the abortion records.

382
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,806
Can the group from Paddy's
Pub please focus up.

383
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,074
You guys have been very disruptive.

384
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,943
Well, maybe
you should explain it more better

385
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,544
because I'm totally confused about...

386
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,546
Maybe if you stopped interrupting.

387
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,215
Maybe if you two stopped
sucking a fat dick.

388
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,234
- You do suck a fat dick.
- You've sucked a dick through this process.

389
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,503
What? Are you kidding me?

390
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,505
After all of this,
I ended up firing her?

391
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,441
Oh, my God.

392
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,310
Hey, Larry?
How soon can you get to the Hyatt?

393
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,379
My dong fell out. Some woman saw it.

394
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,447
Well, goddamn it.

395
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:28,065
All right, calm down, calm down.

396
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,534
Everybody take it easy,
everybody take a deep breath.

397
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,002
You know, we're gonna get through this.

398
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,337
I think, look, Kate,

399
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,272
you two are clearly a little
in over your heads here.

400
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,141
Right? Yeah.
You're never gonna be able to rein in

401
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,876
this particular group,
so I tell you what.

402
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,211
I have some experience running, uh,

403
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,014
little educational seminars like this,

404
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,032
so why don't I take
over for a little bit.

405
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,101
You guys, scoot.
All right? On your bikes.

406
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,148
- Here's a statistic for you:
- _

407
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:58,379
100% of men are capable
of being sexual harassers.

408
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:02,666
And 100% of women
are capable of being sexually harassed.

409
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,535
Now, am I saying that all men

410
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,937
are sexual harassers?
No, no, no, no. No, no.

411
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,606
Of course not. No. Absolutely not. No.

412
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,091
Yes, some men are, uh, well,

413
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,676
they're-they're sexual harassers,

414
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,744
but they don't represent all men,
you know,

415
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,145
just like all women aren't represented

416
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,214
by a few bad ones, you know.
Women like, uh...

417
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:21,369
You know, and of course...

418
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:22,836
And then we got...

419
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:24,638
Point is,

420
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,708
that gender really doesn't
have anything to do with it.

421
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,844
There's really only one
thing that determines

422
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,046
whether a person will be
accused of sexual harassment,

423
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,247
and that is...

424
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,332
ugliness.

425
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:37,534
Let me explain.

426
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,870
Now, see, here's a,
here's a graph of ugliness

427
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,939
as it relates to time.

428
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,741
Now you see how the,
how the arrow plunges

429
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,210
pretty steeply downward as
your ugliness increases.

430
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,812
Now I want you to
imagine a scenario for me

431
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,881
where this man walks into work one day,

432
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,966
sees a woman, and says,
"I like your dress."

433
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:56,370
Oh. Mildly sexual,
but innocuous enough, yeah.

434
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:00,974
Now imagine the same
sentence spoken by this man.

435
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,310
Yeah.

436
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,578
Suddenly, you're very uncomfortable.

437
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:06,780
We're all uncomfortable
just looking at him now.

438
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,201
Because he's gross, he's ugly,
he's a little bit of a monster.

439
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,869
Now is it this man's fault
that he looks this way?

440
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,689
No. He was, he was born this way,
but the point is,

441
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,236
I know it's not my fault, you know.
Is it your fault? I don't think so.

442
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,193
It's certainly not the woman's fault,
you know?

443
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,280
The point is, know your place,
monster man. Your time's up.

444
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,766
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

445
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:28,369
You're thinking,
"How do I know if I'm ugly?

446
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,037
Well, if you're not sure,

447
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,505
probably best to assume that you are.

448
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,641
Everyone in this room is.
I-I did a scan.

449
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,109
Now here's the part where you say,

450
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,111
"But, Dennis, I can't be ugly,

451
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:38,979
I'm rich."

452
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:42,333
And, yes, money can offset
and reduce ugliness,

453
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,935
but it actually increases your risk.

454
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,004
You see, a construction worker,
he can can catcall women

455
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,376
all day long, right?
And he gets away with it

456
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,775
'cause nobody gives a shit,
but a rich guy...

457
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,648
A rich guy's fun to take down.

458
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,412
Time's up.

459
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,065
"But, Dennis," you're saying,

460
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,101
"I can't be ugly, and-and it
doesn't matter because I'm gay."

461
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,436
Well, guess what, pal?

462
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,172
You-you are ugly,
and it doesn't matter how much

463
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,375
you work out.
It's never gonna change that fact.

464
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,643
You've also objectified tons of men,
including me.

465
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,312
You know,
you got to stop kissing me, man.

466
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,380
I don't want it.
I don't want you touching me at all.

467
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,399
Okay, it's never gonna happen.
All right?

468
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,201
Not willingly. Your time's up.

469
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:22,406
"But, Dennis, I can't be ugly.
I'm a hopeless romantic."

470
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:24,675
But no, you're-you're not.

471
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,677
Okay, you're-you're a sad,
pathetic wretch of a man,

472
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,478
so desperate to be loved

473
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,881
that you'll actually go rifling
through somebody's garbage.

474
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,900
And there's nothing...

475
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,170
<i>nothing</i> more unattractive
than desperation.

476
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,105
To... No, not him.

477
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,507
No, talking about you. No.

478
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:40,775
Not him, either. Yeah, I am talking

479
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,976
about you. You know what,
never mind. Your time's up.

480
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,447
"But Dennis...
I-I... see, I can't be ugly, all right?

481
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,866
I'm a woman."

482
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,200
Well, no, women can be ugly,

483
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,602
and you are one of them.

484
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,537
One of the ugly ones.
You're lanky, and your hair's...

485
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,006
well, it looks like a wig.
Yeah. What's going on?

486
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,075
Is it a wig? Doesn't matter.
Your time's up.

487
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,211
But guys,

488
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,812
I got some good news for you.

489
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,281
Okay? It's not a crime to be ugly.

490
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,500
But you can't be ugly

491
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,502
and sloppy.

492
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:10,704
So, take me, for example.

493
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,574
I'm neither. Yeah, you see that?

494
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:16,710
That is 11% body fat.
Now, the only place you're gonna...

495
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,378
- What year was that photo taken?
- No, no, no.

496
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:20,047
Not taking questions right now, Mac.

497
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,315
So just... Yeah.

498
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,533
Point is, I keep my body tight.

499
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,670
But I also keep my life tight.

500
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,272
I got the tapes. I got the receipts.

501
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,608
They're all time-stamped and coded.

502
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,209
After every encounter, I received a text

503
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,845
confirming each partner's
consent and enjoyment.

504
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,699
Now, you may ask, "Well...

505
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,302
would a woman really-really
text that, Dennis?"

506
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,671
Their phones did.

507
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:46,272
- _
- _

508
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,776
I got the documents to prove it,
so don't try coming at me.

509
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:51,712
But some of you...

510
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,980
you just haven't been careful enough.

511
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:57,467
So you're asking yourself,
"What can I do to save myself now?"

512
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,803
You got to clean up your act.
Otherwise, you're going down,

513
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,138
and you're gonna take me down with you,

514
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,606
and I ain't going down.

515
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,075
You understand?
I've been telling you this for years,

516
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,610
but you refused to listen.

517
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,812
And so that's why I had to
find a way to make you listen,

518
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,699
which is why<i> I</i> created
the Shitty Bar List.

519
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:13,767
What?

520
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:14,902
That's right.

521
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,437
I made the spreadsheet,
I posted it online,

522
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,572
and I even hired these two
bozos to host the seminar.

523
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:19,874
Wait,<i> you</i> hired us?

524
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,509
You're a monster.

525
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:25,179
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

526
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh, wow! I feel like we should clap.

527
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,235
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

528
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,636
- That was pretty good.
- That was awesome.

529
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,705
Yeah. I'm gonna be honest,
I didn't follow most of it,

530
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,907
- but so cool, man.
- Yeah.

531
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,309
Pretty drastic move
to publicly expose us,

532
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,445
but I see why you did it.

533
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,781
Yeah, but it's true.
I mean, women are out to get us.

534
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,248
Well, well, no, no. Women are right.

535
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,401
I mean, men are monsters.
We're constantly harassing them.

536
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,203
I'm just saying we need
to be more careful

537
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,804
so we don't get accused.

538
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,206
And we should probably
stop harassing them.

539
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,741
Uh, well, you know, I don't know.
One step at a time.

540
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,942
We don't want the whole
system to collapse,

541
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,478
- you know what I mean?
- Ease-ease into it.

542
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,013
- It'd be chaotic. Yeah, yeah.
- Ease into it.

543
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:00,347
Yeah, yeah.
You guys want to go grab some margaritas

544
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,482
- by the pool?
- Oh.

545
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:02,499
- I do.
- Booze.

546
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,834
- I'm ready for some booze.
- Oh, yeah.

547
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,102
- Let's go.
- Yeah. - Me, too.

548
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,085
Oh!

549
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,839
- Oh, "MeToo."
- Very good.

550
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,375
- That's great.
- Very good, and for a woman, a good joke.

551
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,443
Hey, you guys think that
Alan guy's got a big dick?

552
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,512
- Oh, yeah.
- Huge.

553
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,180
I saw it in the bathroom.
I sought it out.
