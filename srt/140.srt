1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:01,335
- This is slow shit.
- _

2
00:00:01,336 --> 00:00:02,484
<i>- Is it? 'Cause mine's</i>
- _

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,352
- going super slow, too. Yeah.
- Really?

4
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:06,288
I heard if you just do
the new software update,

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,156
- then everything moves faster.
- Oh, there's a new update?

6
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:09,959
- Yeah, yeah. Just go to settings.
- Uh-huh.

7
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,560
- Uh-huh. Is that the little gear thing?
- And then... Yep.

8
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:13,311
And then just click update.

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,779
How long's it gonna take?

10
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,248
Uh, says 30 minutes.

11
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,317
- What?
- What?! - What?

12
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,119
What are we gonna do without
our phones for 30 minutes?

13
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:21,987
We don't need the phones.

14
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,723
Maybe... Oh. What if we just kick back

15
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,725
and remember some of the good old days?

16
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,460
No. What?

17
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,945
No, no, no, no.
Come on, what are you talking about?

18
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,613
Look, we can think of something to do.

19
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,149
- I don't know, it does sound kind of fun.
- That's what you do

20
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,483
when you start getting old.

21
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,152
You know, you start reliving the glory days

22
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:39,154
'cause you can't think
of anything new to do.

23
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:40,955
Do you remember the time that I sewed myself

24
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:42,291
into the couch naked?

25
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:43,959
- Uh, yes. Remember?
- Oh.

26
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,027
Oh, great, now you've...

27
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,059
Oh, what in the hell?

28
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,718
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

29
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,054
- Oh, no.
- What is happening?

30
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,789
Can't breathe.

31
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,056
- Too hot.
- Why are you naked, Frank?

32
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,126
- It was too hot. Leather couch.
- Okay. But did you hear?

33
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,678
- She called you an asshole.
- She called you an asshole, Frank.

34
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:05,347
No air. No air.

35
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,350
- Air! Air!
- God!

36
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:13,112
_

37
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,148
I was running down the street.

38
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,818
I was, I was naked. I didn't feel the cold.

39
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,553
I-I was just sweating bullets.

40
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,287
- You were soaking.
- Slimy.

41
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:48,090
And the way you tell that,
it's like I was there.

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,625
- And I was not there. I was not there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

43
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,161
- We were there, and it was like that.
- Hey, guys.

44
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,580
Yeah, we were there.
Guys, guys, uh, what about this memory?

45
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,240
Uh, hola,<i> estÃºpidos.</i>

46
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,919
- What is that? What is that from?
- What are you doing?

47
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,388
Um, can I ask you a question?

48
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,723
- I...
- You're just doing a bad accent?

49
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,725
- What, what...?
- That's not... No? -MAC: Yeah.

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,127
- That's not really a memory.
- You're remembering the time

51
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,595
you burned a Mexican's house down?

52
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,546
- No, no, not that one. I was doing a character.
- Oh.

53
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,749
I was thinking we could remember
all my hilarious characters

54
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:15,617
- that I've created.
- You've never had any.

55
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,419
Now, hang on a second.
You've created characters?

56
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,087
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,824
Y-You don't remember Taiwan Tammy?

58
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,358
- Oh! Oh, my goodness.
- Oh! You can't do that.

59
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:25,360
- We decided that isn't funny anymore.
- You can't...

60
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:26,611
- No, that's right.
- All right.

61
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,581
Well, what about
my Saint Patrick's Day? The...

62
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,983
I'm Crazy Pad...

63
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,184
Oh.

64
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,252
Oh! Yes!

65
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,787
- Oh, wow. That was hilarious.
- Wow.

66
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,656
- That was funny.
- Ow!

67
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,796
- Ooh, ooh, guys! I got an idea.
- Ooh!

68
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,259
Why don't we remember all the times

69
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,928
- that Dee's gotten hurt.
- No. What? What?

70
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm not doing that, okay? No.

71
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,281
I-It's too late. I'm already remembering it.

72
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,337
Holy shi...

73
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,158
I found the kittens.

74
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:58,360
Oh, come on!

75
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,676
I wanted to, uh...

76
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,608
Oh. Upsy-daisy.

77
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,080
You guys are exaggerating.

78
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:19,748
You weren't even there for half of that.

79
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,417
It's just how we remember it, Dee. I mean...

80
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,086
You can't, you can't beat
physical comedy memories.

81
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,421
- They're timeless.
- Yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:28,490
Oh, you know what? Let's remember
all, like, the classic times.

83
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:30,058
- You know, like, the best of the best.
- Yeah.

84
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,823
Ho ho ho ho.

85
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,280
Well, hello, and Merry Christmas.

86
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,851
So, where's your little one? Oh.

87
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,921
Ho ho ho ho. You're a big boy, aren't you?

88
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,724
Uh, is he (bleep)?

89
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,059
I got this one.

90
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,346
So, son, what would you like for Christmas?

91
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,348
Huh?

92
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,350
Did you fuck my mom?

93
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:57,920
What?

94
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,889
Did you fuck...

95
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,959
my mom?

96
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,361
What do you mean? I, uh...

97
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,780
Did you fuck my mom, Santa Claus?

98
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,915
- Mm-mm.
- Did you fuck my mom?

99
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,116
- No, I...
- Did you fuck her?

100
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,384
- No, I...
- Did you fuck my fucking mom?

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,586
Did you fuck my mom, Santa?!

102
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,055
He's biting my neck!

103
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,323
Wait, you're gonna kill him!

104
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,592
- He's biting my neck!
- You're gonna kill Santa Claus!

105
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,994
Brakes. No.
Guys, why aren't the brakes working?

106
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,081
Because I cut the brakes.
Wild card, bitches!

107
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,083
Yee-haw!

108
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,085
- What? Charlie!
- What?!

109
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,721
- Seriously? What?!
- Abort! Abort! Abort!

110
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,225
You want to maybe put this divider up?

111
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,995
Well, no. We don't want to
exclude a great man like Frank

112
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,023
from the conversa...

113
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,182
Oh, my God!

114
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,985
- Call 911!
- Oh, no, it's okay.

115
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,786
I have a touch of consumption.

116
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,927
- That seems really dark.
- No, no, it's not dark.

117
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,395
- You're misunderstanding me, bro. Okay?
- I-I...

118
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,813
- I think I am.
- Yeah, you are.

119
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,947
Because if the girl said no,
then the answer,

120
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,415
- obviously, is no.
- No.

121
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:01,883
- Right.
- But the thing is is she's not gonna say no.

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,853
She would never say no
because of the implication.

123
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:09,491
Now, you...
you've said that word "implication"

124
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,360
a couple of times. W-What implication?

125
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,712
The implication that things
might go wrong for her

126
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,447
if she refuses to sleep with me.

127
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,449
Now, not that things
<i>are</i> gonna go wrong for her,

128
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,786
- but she's thinking that they will.
- Are you gonna hurt women?

129
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,120
- I'm not gonna hurt these women.
- Oh, okay.

130
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,989
- Why would I ever hurt these women?
- I don't know.

131
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,590
- I feel like you're not getting this at all.
- I'm not getting it.

132
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,726
I am gonna punch a hole through your face.

133
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,013
I'd like to see you try that.

134
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,882
I don't feel we're reading as eagles.

135
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:36,284
No, bro. We look like assholes.

136
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,153
They didn't turn out the
way that I had envisioned.

137
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:39,922
I'm getting more of a chicken vibe.

138
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,357
Oh, hey, Dee.

139
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,578
You know, you and me palling around.

140
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,515
Getting nuts. Doing crazy...

141
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,184
I'm not doing any kind of things

142
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,186
that you want me to do with you, Uncle Jack.

143
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,720
And action.

144
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:56,922
I'll read the words you wrote.

145
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,657
"Hello, fellow American.

146
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,726
"This you should vote me.

147
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,061
"I leave power. Good.

148
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,812
Thank you."

149
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:05,880
Thank you.

150
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,684
"Taxes, they'll be lower... son.

151
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,686
"The Democratic vote for
me is right thing to do,

152
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,756
Philadelphia, so do."

153
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,625
I'm gonna gun this car as fast as it goes

154
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,159
- directly into that wall.
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,712
<i>The last possible second,
we jump out to safety,</i>

156
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,180
and we're dead to the world.

157
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,849
Okeydokey. Good luck with that.

158
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,250
Wait, where are you going, dude?

159
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,453
Well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna watch you do it.

160
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,455
- No, we need to do it together.
- I'm not really doing anything.

161
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,324
Well, yes, you are, Charlie.
You're here for moral support

162
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,925
- on top of that.
- I know, but if no one's actually seeing us

163
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,259
jump out of the car,
whatever, it's not exciting.

164
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:36,811
Well, it's...
We're gonna kill ourselves together.

165
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,347
- I'm gonna watch you. All right.
- Get out, get out, get out!

166
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,289
I'll do it myself. Get out!

167
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:40,677
The whole thing's really
better without me anyway, Mac.

168
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,174
I'm telling you,
it's gonna be great without me.

169
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:45,320
- All right, buddy, good luck.
- Pussy.

170
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,848
Mac?

171
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,316
Holy shit, dude!

172
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,785
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

173
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,119
- Why didn't you jump out?
- I'm okay.

00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,824
I can't do any of this shit anymore.

- Okay? I'm... I'm leaving.

No, hold on a second. You can't just leave.

184
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,379
- Dennis.
- Yeah, dude. What-what about us?

185
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,914
I mean, what about... what about the bar?

186
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,649
Good-bye, Paddy's Pub.

Good-bye, Philadelphia. Good-bye, Charlie.

Mac, Dee, Frank.

189
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:37,923
The bar is done.

190
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,478
Good-bye, Philadelphia.

191
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,281
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second. What...?

192
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,217
- What the hell was that?
- Yeah.

193
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:50,685
What was that? I am not an ostrich.

194
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:52,220
Yeah. No, no, no,
that's not what I'm talking about.

195
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,821
I'm talking about the last memory

196
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,356
where Mac turned the lights off to the bar.

197
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:57,558
Yeah, what about it?

198
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:00,028
Well, that never happened.
<i>I-I</i> turned the lights off.

199
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,979
No, that's not how I remember it.

200
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,782
No, Mac, that's not what happened.

201
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,318
- Yeah, thank you, Dee.
- Pretty sure I turned the lights off.

202
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,119
Oh, right. Yes, it was you,
and then I flipped them back on.

203
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,987
Yeah. Yeah, and I was like, "No!
Get him out here.

204
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,590
- Let him go."
- Yeah, actually, we did a great bit.

205
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,525
We're like...
♪ Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah. ♪

206
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,059
No, no. Wait, wait. No, guys. No, remember?

207
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,594
I quit the bar,

208
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,280
I moved to North Dakota,
and I shut the lights off.

209
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,015
Wait. You went to North Dakota?

210
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,883
I don't remember Dennis leaving.

211
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,618
Wait. No. Goddamn it. Come on, guys.

212
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,887
The... Look, this is how it went down, okay?

213
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,156
Good-bye, Paddy's Pub.

214
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,759
Good-bye, Philadelphia. Good-bye, Charlie.

215
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:32,827
Mac, Dee, Frank.

216
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,813
The bar is done.

217
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,850
- So, go!
- ♪ Da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da! ♪

218
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,118

- ♪ Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da ♪

219
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,486
Stop sucking and go.

220
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,254
Stop sucking and go.

221
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,856
- So was, uh... sneaking that...
- No.

222
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,324
- Yeah. I told you. Yeah, wasn't that good?
- Yeah, right.

223
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,993
Okay, now, see,

224
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,594
now you're infecting my
memory with your memory,

225
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,080
and I can't even remember
my own life correctly.

226
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,815
- Yeah.
- I think you are remembering it right.

227
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,283
- Yeah.
- It was a pretty good pick now that I remember it.

228
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:56,952
Guys, no, can we not do this?

229
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,487
Can we not start messing
with each other's memories?

230
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,489
Okay? Distorting facts, like,
basically changes history.

231
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,558
You know what?
It's like fake news, you know?

232
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,426
And then, all of a sudden,
nobody knows what the truth is,

233
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,646
and facts don't matter.
Guys, it's a slippery slope.

234
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,047
Okay, okay, you know what?

235
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,584
Fine. Let's try to remember something
we all know for sure happened like, um...

236
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,886
like<i> The Nightman Cometh.</i>

237
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:17,624
_

238
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:21,369
_

239
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:22,370
_

240
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,771
_

241
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,280
- What the hell was that?
- Huh?

242
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,150
- What was that?
- Oh, I'm just remembering

243
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,685
when I-I told Mac I was gonna cut the song.

244
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:32,687
Right, but why was that memory
in a different language?

245
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,555
Oh, shit. You know what's happening?

246
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,290
All right, now I'm getting confused,

247
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,193
'cause I was remembering the
time that I spoke Chinese, so...

248
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,912
- You never spoke Chinese.
- Yeah.

249
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,714
Yeah, I did. They gave me
a magic pill, and I learned it,

250
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,182
- and I speak it fluently.
- No. - Mm, no, they didn't.

251
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,850
- Mm-mm.
- Uh, no, buddy.

252
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,186
Oh, by the way,
we're getting way off track here.

253
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,854
- What-what is happening?
- Yeah.

254
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,190
Oh, why don't we remember all the times

255
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,259
that somebody didn't
know what was happening.

256
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,261
A business opportunity as rare

257
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,281
as the albani berries themselves.

258
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,883
What's happening?

259
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,021
What is happening?

260
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,690
"His name was Dennis."

261
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,493
- I'm-I'm sorry. What is happ...?
- Silence.

262
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:14,822
- What is happening?
- We don't know.

263
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:15,775
Come on now!

264
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,016
- What is happening?
- What is happening?!

265
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,497
<i>Reliving old memories is so fun.</i>

266
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:27,552
<i>I'm having a blast.</i>

267
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:32,414
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, guys, I got one
I think we can all remember... the contest.

268
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,815
- Oh, the contest.
- The contest.

269
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,284
- Ooh.
- Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, yeah.

270
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:39,754
Hey.

271
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,355
- Hey.
- Hey. - Hey.

272
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,958
Well, where's my money? Who caved?

273
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,893
- Not me.
- Not me.

274
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,646
- No.
- Hmm. What are you guys looking at?

275
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,513
Oh, there's a naked woman across the street.

276
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,019
This is gonna be the easiest
money I've ever made.

277
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,989
So my friend Joyce is
teaching an exercise class.

278
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,524
I think I'm gonna go tonight.

279
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,928
Uh, the waitress should have taken it back.

280
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,951
So then, um, I got a call this morning.

281
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:11,553
You know, I was, uh...

282
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,655
I was chosen to go on the space shuttle.

283
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,559
We're going to Mars.

284
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:19,861
- Uh-huh.
- Have a good time.

285
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,584
I'm out!

286
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,750
That was, like,
one of the best memories of all time.

287
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,617
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:45,353
- Well, yeah, it's a classic really, and...
- Yeah.

289
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,555
- It was so Jewish. Really.
- Yeah, uh...

290
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,557
Yeah, it is. It is.
The only thing is, though,

291
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,359
is that that wasn't us.

292
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,161
What are you talking about?
Of course it was us. We just...

293
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,179
- They just...
- Yeah, the whole... We're in the apartment.

294
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,715
Yeah, I'm forgetting.
When did we live in New York City?

295
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,251
- God, when was that?
- Oh. Oh, uh...

296
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,785
- It was like mid-'90s, right?
- '90s, yeah.

297
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,787
- Early '90s.
- Early '90s?

298
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,322
Is that right?
Yeah, when we were in high school?

299
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,790
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Were we?

300
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,191
And-and-and who were those people laughing?

301
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:08,654
Fans.

302
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:09,855
- Oh, the fans.
- The fans.

303
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,346
- Yeah.
- Right. - The fans?

304
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:12,747
- Fans.
- The fans. Guys...

305
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,348
You guys are remembering
an episode of<i> Seinfeld.</i>

306
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,017
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! - That's it.

307
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:17,619
- That's what it is.
- Whoa. - That's what it is.

308
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:19,754
- Yeah.
- Memories are tricky. - Yeah.

309
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,422
Wait, wait, wait,
but when we saw that episode,

310
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,624
- we had our own contest.
- Yeah. - Yeah. No.

311
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,292
- That's what it is.
- That's right.

312
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,360
- We did that contest.
- That's what you were trying to remember.

313
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,561
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

314
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,580
We had our own contest, except ours was
to see who could masturbate the<i> most</i>

315
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,315
in a 24-hour period.

316
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,451
Yeah, that, uh...
that-that landed us in the hospital.

317
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,188
Your penises have suffered severe abrasions.

318
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:41,126
The skin has been all but
removed from the organs.

319
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,595
I've... I've never seen anything like it.

320
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,013
And my vagina?

321
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,148
I'm afraid it's been, uh...

322
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,084
- obliterated.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

323
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,392
No. no, no, no. You guys are doing it again.

324
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:52,359
You're misremembering.
Okay, that's... that is not how that

325
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,014
went down, okay? And that doctor... he...

326
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:56,024
That's not even a real doctor.

327
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,692
That guy was like a
figment of my imagination

328
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,361
from when we got stuck
in the convenience store.

329
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,546
Well, then you must have
described it to me perfectly,

330
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,481
- because I remember the dude.
- Yeah, well, look,

331
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,949
you can't do this, okay?

332
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,285
Every time you misremember something,
like, run the risk of altering reality.

333
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,888
- Altering reality?
- Yeah, uh, yes. I'm just say...

334
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,957
I'm saying, like, how you remember something

335
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,893
sort of, like, becomes reality.

336
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,561
You're saying I can change reality.

337
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,312
Yeah, well, no, I'm not saying...

338
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,648
No, it doesn't change reality.
Reality is reality.

339
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,983
I'm just saying it becomes<i> your</i> reality.

340
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,055
Charlie?

341
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,191
I wanted to talk to you
about the other night.

342
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,726
Oh.

343
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,594
Cool. Wh-Which night, though?

344
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,279
'Cause there's been a lot of nights.

345
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,615
The night we had sex.

346
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,417
- Oh, that night.
- Yeah.

347
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,753
That was... that was a great night.

348
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,021
It was.

349
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,957
And I'm pregnant.

350
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,227
Wow, like...

351
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,212
is it mine?

352
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,915
Yep.

353
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,316
- Huh.
- Okay, I have...

354
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,184
I have so many problems with that.

355
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,919
Come on, man, I'm just trying to,
like, remember, like,

356
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,855
something about the waitress
so I can alter my reality.

357
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,124
You get it. Like, having a baby,
being back together.

358
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:04,859
Then again, that-that's not remembering,

359
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,861
that's just making stuff up.
Also, I have a problem

360
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,746
with<i> how</i> you were attempting
to remember, you know,

361
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,615
the way you were just watching
yourself watch yourself

362
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,083
through the door, like the...

363
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,252
like the Ghost of Christmas
Past or something.

364
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,953
Well, that's just how everyone remembers.

365
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,756
- Mm-mm.
- No, no, it's not. - Nobody does.

366
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,557
But it doesn't matter anyway,
because it's not like

367
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,358
he can change reality, right?

368
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:24,112
Charlie? Give me a hand
with this kid, would you?

369
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:27,048
His diaper smells like a homeless man
took a dump in it.

370
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,583
Oh, shit, that's a baby.

371
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:29,851
Wait, wait, wait. What the hell is this?

372
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:30,785
Holy shit, it worked!

373
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:32,186
I did it! I did it!

374
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,188
- Charlie! Come on!
- I'm coming.

375
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:36,791
Geez, I'm carrying, like, a million things.

376
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,927
- Whoa! Oh! What the hell?
- Two Charlies?

377
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,776
Well, it's not like the baby's
gonna drop dead just 'cause I'm

378
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,681
two seconds behind you coming into the bar.

379
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,150
Wait a second. Maybe by watching yourself

380
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,886
watch yourself, you created two Charlies?

381
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,421
That's not good.

382
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,890
Hey! Hey, you, man!

383
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,360
Look, that-that's my girl. That's my kid.

384
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,178
You got to get out of here, dude.

385
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,046
Oh, my God, there's two of you?

386
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:01,916
Okay, well, one of you
has to change this baby's diaper,

387
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,784
'cause I need to go get drunk.

388
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:06,454
Are you gonna... Oh, dude.
Thanks a lot, man.

389
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,190
Wait, wait, wait. Why is your voice so high?

390
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,059
<i>My</i> voice is high?
I'm the one with the normal voice.

391
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:12,393
You're the one with the high voice, dude.

392
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,661
I have a high voice?

393
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,745
You're telling me I have a high voice?

394
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,814
Yeah, your voice is crazy sounding!

395
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,349
Are you kidding me?

396
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,751
- Oh, it's hearing itself.
- Do you even hear yourself, bro?

397
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,686
This is bizarre.

398
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,737
Look, it doesn't matter, man.
You got to get lost, all right?

399
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,957
- There can only be one of us.
- Oh, please,

400
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,425
please let me get lost.

401
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,427
You know what? Take the kid, take the girl.

402
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,929
I'll go back to living with Frank,
'cause I miss him.

403
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:34,789
Aw. Charlie, that is so nice.

404
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:35,916
I miss you, too.

405
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,251
Wait, wait, wait, this isn't right,
this isn't right.

406
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,586
We must not be back in reality.

407
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,121
We must still be in somebody's memory.

408
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,256
- Oh, yeah? Like whose?
- Like whose?

409
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,258
- Don't copy me.
- I don't know.

410
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:44,287
Wait.

411
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,928
Frank, why do you have hair?

412
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:50,014
- I've always had hair.
- Bullshit, Frank. You have n...

413
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,583
You know what, we're in his head right now.
That's why Charlie 2

414
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,219
was talking about wanting to
go back to living with him.

415
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,954
It's insane; Charlie already
went back to living with me.

416
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,489
- We're not in<i> my</i> head.
- Oh, yeah?

417
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,758
- Nah. Uh-uh.
- Then why are your legs so long?

418
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,378
My legs have always been long.
It's a burden being tall.

419
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:05,913
Ah, bullshit, Frank. We're in your head.

420
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,715
Get us out of there. Come on, man.

421
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,183
- Ah...
- Ah, yeah.

422
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,252
Oh, you couldn't let me have that memory?

423
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,721
No, Frank, because it wasn't a memory,
it was a fantasy.

424
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:15,523
I liked the two me's.
That was a really cool angle, though.

425
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:16,657
- That was good.
- Yeah, okay, fine, but th...

426
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,659
Can we not go there, please?

427
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:20,394
All right? For Christ's sakes,
we can't even just sit around

428
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,080
having memories without
things getting out of hand.

429
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,881
Well, at least we're not being lazy, right?
We're coming up

430
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,617
- with new stuff.
- Yeah, all right, all right, okay,

431
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,152
let's stop, okay? We-we had our fun,

432
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,554
now we're back to reality, a-and let's just,

433
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:30,955
I'd like to keep it that way, so...

434
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,258
- Yeah, software update's almost done anyway.
- Oh, nice.

435
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,093
Okay, good, well... Wait.

436
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,028
- Dee.
- What?

437
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:39,113
Where's your cut?

438
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,316
What cut?

439
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:44,185
The giant, gaping cut that
was-was just on your forehead.

440
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,054
- Where is it?
- Oh. I don't... I don't know.

441
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,190
Is she changing reality?

442
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,858
I don't know.
I don't know what it means, okay?

443
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:54,061
But I do know that we're not back
in the real reality, and that's not good.

444
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,013
Wait a second. Are we not?
Like, are you sure

445
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,548
she actually fell,
that that actually happened?

446
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,551
I don't know. I don't know. I mean,
this is so disorienting. I don't know.

447
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,487
- Dee, snap us back.
- I can't. I'm trying.

448
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,223
All right, all right, wha-what if
it's not<i> that</i> much different?

449
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,025
You know? Like, what if this reality,

450
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,493
the only difference is that Dee
doesn't have a cut on her head?

451
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,779
- Is that that big of a deal?
- Yes, it's a big deal.

452
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,982
You're talking about never knowing
which reality you're living in.

453
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,518
Okay, you know what?
We need to, we need to orient ourselves.

454
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,053
Um... Frank.

455
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,254
- Yeah?
- Are you tall and handsome

456
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,588
with a full head of hair?

457
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,190
I like to think so, but no.

458
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,459
No. Good. Okay, so, Charlie,

459
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,926
is the waitress in love with you?

460
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,212
Aw, I had her for a minute, but no.

461
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,547
Great. Uh, Dee,
are you a successful actress?

462
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,883
Oh, I could have been.

463
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,418
Dee, be serious! Yes or no?

464
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,485
- No.
- Yeah.

465
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,754
Mac, um, are you my roommate?

466
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,222
- No, of course not.
- Oh!

467
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,091
- Okay, well, so there it is.
- There we go.

468
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,694
- All right, Mac, it's clearly you...
- Oh.

469
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,245
...so snap us out of it, man.

470
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,847
No. W-We're not in my head. I swear.

471
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,849
Yes, we are, man. We're in your head.

472
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:49,250
You're trying to alter reality.

473
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,852
Dude, if we were in my head,

474
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,521
why would I not want you to be my roommate?

475
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,390
But...

476
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,524
- Ah...
- Oh, I get it. - Wait a minute.

477
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,595
Dennis, we're in your head, aren't we?

478
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

479
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,338
No. Why would we be in my head?

480
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,818
Dennis, everyone knows
that the most annoying person

481
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,620
- in the world is Mac.
- Huh?

482
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,572
So why would you ever want to live with him?

483
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,158
No, that's not... I...
No, he's great as a roommate.

484
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,893
- Is he great?
- Yeah, he's great.

485
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,912
Name one way.

486
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:19,797
Yeah, easy. He, um...

487
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:29,123
- Oh, your head, yeah! So yeah.
- Okay, fine, damn it,

488
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,858
I was trying to, yeah, get rid of him.

489
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,526
So you don't like living with me, Dennis?

490
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:34,278
Oh, no, I...
no, I love having a roommate

491
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,280
who spends three hours
a day on a dildo bike.

492
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,082
Guys, see, this is,
this is why I didn't want to do this.

493
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,884
You know? No good can come of it.

494
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,353
- It doesn't feel good.
- It has been kind of messy,

495
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,555
like, you know,
it's been confusing, for sure.

496
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,291
So let's just... we just...
so now we just got to make sure

497
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,694
- we're-we're back in reality.
- Yeah, but how do you ever know

498
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,846
- if you're in reality?
- You know what?

499
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:54,582
I think I got a top here under the bar.
Yeah, I do. I do.

500
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,684
- A top under the bar?
- Top? What do you do with a top? - So?

501
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:59,053
Well, a top.
Didn't you guys see the movie<i> Inception?</i>

502
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:01,255
You know, they spin the top,
and see, the thing is,

503
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,725
if we aren't in reality,
then the top will just spin forever.

504
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:07,812
But if it wobbles and falls,
then you know you're back in reality.

505
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,081
- Should we give it a spin?
- Yeah, let's do it. -Sure.

506
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,149
Let's see.

507
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,151
Seems like that's gonna go
for a while, though.

508
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,020
It does, it seems like it's gonna...

509
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:18,356
- Gave it a hell of a spin there.
- Yeah! - Yeah!

510
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,691
Well, it's a good, it's a quality top.

511
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,092
Oh.

512
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,094
- Oh, our phones are updated.
- Oh, for real?

513
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,979
- Oh!
- There we go! - Oh, sweet!

514
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:29,183
- Ah...
- Finally. - Um...

515
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,552
Thank God we're back to normal.

516
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,356
