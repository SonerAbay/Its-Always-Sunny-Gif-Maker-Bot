1
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:03,860
<i>No, your mom is
the monster, all right?</i>

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:04,928
<i>My mom is the sweet one.</i>

3
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:06,729
<i>Oh, the sweet one?</i>

4
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:08,030
Are you kidding me? Uh, look,

5
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:09,866
if anything, my mom's
aggravatingly sweet,

6
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:11,702
but we're not having an argument
about who's sweeter, what...

7
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:13,303
Whoa, whoa, hang on a second here, guys.

8
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:14,303
What are you going on about?

9
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:15,305
All right, look,

10
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:16,540
my mom's been calling me,

11
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:17,541
like, all the time, okay?

12
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:19,076
She's clearly upset.

13
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,410
Well, how would you know?
You don't even answer.

14
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,812
My mom stopped calling me altogether.

15
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:23,879
Your mom stopped calling you

16
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:24,915
the day the phone was invented.

17
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:26,216
My mom has a great relationship with me.

18
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,551
- She never calls you!
- She calls me all the time!

19
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,651
- Yes, she does!
- But I have proof, anyway.

20
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:29,652
I have proof. Look at this.

21
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:30,820
I got this in the mail.

22
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:33,089
Is that, like, a ransom
note from Mac's mom?

23
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,391
Huh? No. This... my mom sent this.

24
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:38,061
Oh. Why would your mom write
a ransom note to herself?

25
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:39,730
Oh, it's not a...
it's not a ransom note.

26
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,231
This is just how she writes notes to me.

27
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:42,665
That-that's like a bunch
of gibberish, Charlie.

28
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:43,733
I don't know...

29
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,334
Is that a hieroglyph of a dog?

30
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,904
Yeah, that's the animal my
mom fears the most, right?

31
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:50,340
She-she feels trapped
inside her own home.

32
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:51,341
There is no way

33
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:52,676
you could get that from this.

34
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,076
Oh-oh, okay, guys, guys, guys.

35
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,411
I think I have a pretty
simple solution here.

36
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:56,747
You see, ever since I moved in

37
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,582
with Mac, and Dee and Old Black Man,

38
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:00,750
my surveillance system's
just lying around in storage.

39
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:02,085
I got about a baker's dozen of cameras.

40
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:03,353
They're just sitting there.

41
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:04,921
I say we set them up in your mom's home

42
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:06,523
and find out what's
really going on in there.

43
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,592
- That could work. I mean, yeah.
- Great idea.

44
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:09,793
- You don't think that's creepy?
- What?

45
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:11,595
He's talking about spying on your moms.

46
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:12,595
So what?

47
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:14,931
You can't spy on unsuspecting women.

48
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,266
That's horrible.

49
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:18,368
Uh, they're not women. They're old.

50
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:19,869
At a certain point a woman
goes from being a woman

51
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:21,437
to just being an old person.

52
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,273
- True.
- Well, what happens to a man?

53
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:25,142
A man lives and then dies. Why
are we having this argument?

54
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:26,810
- A man remains a man.
- Dennis, it's a great idea.

55
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:28,779
Okay, and no one's gonna get hurt.

56
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,780
It's not like they're gonna
get exploited in any way, right?

57
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,683
No, no, no, exactly. I
think once we have a look

58
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,651
at what's going on in there,
we might find the situation

59
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:36,286
to be, uh, pretty comical.

60
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,973
Oh, it's so nice of you to bring us

61
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,263
all these lovely gifts, Charlie.

62
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:08,078
The plant, the globe,

63
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,078
and the little teddy bear.

64
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:10,212
Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom.

65
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,580
No, we aren't gonna
touch the gifts, right?

66
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,150
Okay, we don't touch them.
We just, we look at them.

67
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,751
- Okay.
- And they look back at you and they... Hands off.

68
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,821
Mom, make sure you
don't water this plant.

69
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,422
- Your mom's not gonna water the plants.
- Oh.

70
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:20,723
She has a very nurturing
nature. She would...

71
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,057
Oh, Mrs. Mac, are you
gonna water the plants?

72
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,061
- See.
- Oh, Charlie.

73
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:28,164
I'm so glad to see you.

74
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,733
- Yeah, okay.
- I was worried that

75
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,001
- you were dead.
- Why?

76
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,071
Oh, my mom also thought I was dead,

77
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,239
and she also loves me very much.

78
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,843
No, I don't.

79
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,511
Oh, she meant the first part.

80
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,078
She meant the first part where I...

81
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,080
because she can't imagine a
life without me, right, Mom?

82
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,917
I don't give a shit.

83
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,119
- See.
- I'll put you out

84
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,853
of the misery of this conversation. Mom?

85
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:51,854
Is there anything you want to tell me

86
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,023
that's going on in the house?

87
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:54,291
Anything that's bothering you?

88
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:55,524
- Anything you want to talk about?
- Mom, is there anything

89
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:56,692
- that's going on in the house
- What are you doing?

90
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,495
that you want to talk
about that's bothering you

91
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:00,197
- What are you doing?
- in the house or I'm asking my mom a simple question.

92
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,864
You're asking her the exact
same question I just asked,

93
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:02,932
- so what are you...
- Do you own all of the questions?

94
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,301
Do you own that question?

95
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,374
You're gonna steal my question.

96
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,435
Ow!

97
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:07,637
Mom, what happened?

98
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,440
She poured hot soup on me!

99
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:13,108
I was adjusting my undercarriage,

100
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:15,211
and I accidentally spilled it.

101
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,880
- She poured hot soup on her, dude.
- She was adjusting

102
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:19,715
- her undercar... Wait a second.
- What...

103
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:22,118
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

104
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,888
We-we could also get some soup.

105
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:28,520
No, the-the video. We can go back
and watch the video

106
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,994
- and see what actually happened.
- Oh, we can watch and see... Yes.

107
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,733
- ...complain about the soup.
- She's beating the shit out...

108
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:39,636
Gentleman, welcome to your moms.

109
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,238
Wow, man. This is a serious setup.

110
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,573
Yeah, no, it's no joke. I
like how you moved the desk.

111
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:45,634
- All right, uh, look,
- Yeah.

112
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:46,835
there was an incident with some soup.

113
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:49,078
And, uh, did you get anything?
'Cause I'd like to see

114
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,247
if-if his mom poured
on my ma on purpose.

115
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,482
Oh, she definitely did pour it.

116
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,250
And she definitely did it on purpose.

117
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:55,518
There you go. She's abusing my mom, man.

118
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,519
It's clear as day, but
what's really interesting

119
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:58,989
is what seems to be happening right here

120
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:00,858
in the live feed.

121
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,847
Oh. You want to sleep.

122
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,669
Well, I'll sleep you.

123
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:18,015
- Huh.
- Uh... what the hell, man?

124
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,842
- That's your mom abusing my mom!
- Well... No, it's not!

125
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,650
That's just one of those things,
you know,

126
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:22,251
- like where...
- What thing?

127
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,946
You know, where you're just
like, you're like, it's like

128
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,049
a "Why, I oughta," but,
you know, it's no big deal.

129
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:28,051
- Why, I oughta what?
- Why, I oughta bludgeon you

130
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,185
with a hammer. But she's not
actually gonna do it, you know?

131
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,188
It's like how Ralph Kramden on
<i>The Honeymooners</i> would always

132
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,390
say, "Why, I oughta." He was
threatening to beat his wife.

133
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,960
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah. You know? I mean, it's-it's funny

134
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,779
- 'cause he's not actually gonna do it,
- That was funny. Yeah.

135
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,929
even though the threat is always there.

136
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,297
- Yeah, he might...
- Yeah, he might cave her face in,

137
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,032
- but he won't. He won't. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. But he's not gonna, you know?

138
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,135
- That's...
- Yeah, b... Well, that's funny.

139
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,037
But in this circumstance, it's
not funny because it's my mom!

140
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,205
Right, right. Wait,
actually, you know what,

141
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,374
we-we don't really know for
sure whether it's funny or not.

142
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:52,697
You know, let-let me try something here.

143
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:53,498
Let me just...

144
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:55,772
You want to sleep.

145
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:58,648
Well, I'll sleep you.

146
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,586
Hmm. Well, what-what is that?

147
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,056
Well, I don't know, you made
me think of, like, sitcoms,

148
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,592
<i>The Honeymooners.</i> I just
thought, "This isn't very funny."

149
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:11,894
But if I add a laugh
track, maybe, I don't know.

150
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,729
But it's not a show.
This is their lives.

151
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:16,099
Yeah, but it-it does kind
of lighten it up for me.

152
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:17,859
Well, yeah, it did lighten it.
But I'm not saying it...

153
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,835
Can... can you play it again
without the laugh track?

154
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:20,771
Yeah, sure.

155
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,407
Well, I'll sleep you.

156
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,489
- See, that goes right back to super dark.
- It's a bummer without it, isn't it?

157
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:32,414
- It's not funny, it's not funny.
- Yeah, no.

158
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,517
Yeah, but let me...
let me just try it again

159
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,752
with the, uh...

160
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,986
You want to sleep.

161
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:42,235
Well, I'll sleep you.

162
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,129
- That's funny. That's funny!
- I mean... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,431
It's weird, because the
situation really isn't funny,

164
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:51,543
- and you add a laugh track...
- I know, but the laughing tells me that it's funny.

165
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:52,577
They have timing, man.

166
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,278
- They have timing, for sure. Yeah.
- That's great.

167
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:57,106
I don't understand. Is this a
dark situation or a comical one?

168
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,942
Well, we-we don't really know
yet, Mac. We don't know. But...

169
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,876
I tell you what, why don't
we stick around back here

170
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,878
for a little while. Let's watch
how this whole thing plays out.

171
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,781
You know? I'll keep
sweetening the situation

172
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,049
as it calls for it,

173
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:07,985
and you might as well stick around.

174
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:16,059
Did you just ash in my tapioca?

175
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,118
Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:21,898
- Yeah. All right, yeah. I like that.
- This is gold.

177
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,333
- They got something, man. Like... Uh-huh.
- It's really working.

178
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,967
I don't know what this is, but...

179
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,070
- What's this?
- Oh, check it out. Mrs. Mac

180
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,739
and Mrs. Kelly have a
classic comedic rivalry.

181
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,141
I mean, they're going
at it like the greats.

182
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,909
Like Abbott and Costello, Tom and Jerry.

183
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:34,543
- It's amazing.
- Huh.

184
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,651
Oh, sorry. Fly.

185
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:41,016
Buzz off!

186
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,156
All right, well, you know,
if you guys are looking

187
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,991
for a comedy troupe that beats
the shit out of each other

188
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,359
for laughs, there's nobody
better than the Three Stooges.

189
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,095
Put me on the show.

190
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:53,496
- Whoa.
- What show? It's not... it's not a show.

191
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,830
- Yeah...
- We're just watching our moms

192
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,099
to figure out what the situation is.

193
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:57,333
Wh... I mean, it could be a show,

194
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:58,334
but, I mean, you're right.

195
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,535
It's-it's not a show.

196
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:00,669
Yeah, well it certainly looks like

197
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:01,837
you're trying to make a show,

198
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,173
and I think it's a good idea,

199
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,174
and I think you should put me in.

200
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,675
- Why?
- Yeah.

201
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,443
'Cause I'm so much
funnier than these two.

202
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,446
Look at them, they're just
smashing each other with stuff.

203
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,680
I could add a whole, like,

204
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:11,847
physical comedy element, you know?

205
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,881
Hey, I smell chips.

206
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,350
What are we watching?

207
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,717
We're not really watching anything, yet.

208
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,020
Until Big Funny shows up.

209
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,187
You'll see.

210
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,523
Ooh.

211
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,460
Mrs. Kelly looks hot on screen.

212
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:25,127
Come on, man, knock that off.

213
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,463
There's something about people on TV.

214
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:29,198
Catch me up. W-what did I miss?

215
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,400
Uh, well, the grunty one,

216
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,068
physically abuses the shrill one.

217
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,735
And the shrill one
psychologically abuses

218
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:34,870
the grunty one.

219
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:35,904
And it really plays.

220
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,207
It's really funny,

221
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,640
And, you know what, uh, actually,

222
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,310
I-I'm gonna try something here, guys.

223
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,580
You are a horrible woman,

224
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,715
and I can't wait until
those cigarettes kill you.

225
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,751
And I shall dance on your grave.

226
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:54,424
Yeah.

227
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:55,925
This is so great!

228
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,827
And having those other people laugh

229
00:07:57,859 --> 00:07:59,496
tells me when I should laugh.

230
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:00,596
- Good.
- Yeah.

231
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:01,730
I love that.

232
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,066
And the music that I added makes you

233
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,567
- you know that it's light.
- Yeah.

234
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,402
It's also helping me realize
that I think the situation's

235
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,003
okay o-over there, you know?

236
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,906
And-and, honestly, I'm
gonna ignore my mom's note,

237
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,073
like I ignore her phone calls.

238
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,174
I think we're good here.

239
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,342
They have chemistry.

240
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,911
And I really love

241
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,746
how playful and fun my mom's coming off.

242
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,114
- Well.
- Uh, no.

243
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:18,902
- Yeah, no, no.
- Never.

244
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,518
No, no. I actually find your
mom very off-putting.

245
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:23,519
- Yeah.
- She's hard-hard on the eyes.

246
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,520
Tough on the eyes.

247
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:25,687
And you know what else?

248
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,190
- Like, super one-note.
- Yeah.

249
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,758
No! No, no, no, no.

250
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,126
My mom's got lots of notes.

251
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:31,460
She's a symphony.

252
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,095
She's getting so many laughs.

253
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,098
- She's pushing the...
- I'm concerned about longevity.

254
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,532
I mean, she's getting laughs from us,

255
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,935
now, sure, but, uh, I
think that we're gonna

256
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,103
have a problem in the long run.

257
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:41,603
You just don't understand the nuance

258
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:42,772
- of her performance.
- I don't.

259
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:43,873
Cut to a close-up.

260
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:45,275
We need more close-ups.

261
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,479
Mmm.

262
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,817
And she's constantly looking directly

263
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,052
into the camera somehow.

264
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,121
- She's repulsive.
- She is repulsive.

265
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,322
You know what? I'm gonna go over there

266
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:01,724
and-and I'm gonna show you.

267
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:02,992
Sh-she can pop, okay?

268
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,726
She's gonna pop. You'll see.

269
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,601
Uh-oh.

270
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,064
- Hang on.
- What's up?

271
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,499
My mom's trying to call me.

272
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:10,999
Hmm. Oh, wait, wait,
wait, you know what?

273
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:12,301
Don't pick up. Don't pick up.

274
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,335
- Oh, no, I never would.
- Okay, good.

275
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,403
But let's let that play out.

276
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,638
Camera one.

277
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,141
Oh, Charlie.

278
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,008
Charlie, please pick up.

279
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,011
One, two, three.

280
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,646
Charlie, where are you?

281
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,184
One, two, three.

282
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:30,287
Oh.

283
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,727
God, it's me, Bonnie.

284
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,263
I'm so worried about my Charlie boy.

285
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:44,667
Please don't have him
be in a ditch somewhere,

286
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,770
or squished between two trains,

287
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:50,105
and his body mangled,

288
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:53,275
so if they move the trains,

289
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:56,445
all his guts and bodily fluids

290
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,014
and organs spill out.

291
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,184
Please, God...

292
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:03,620
don't have him die.

293
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,021
Aw.

294
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:08,190
I knew it.

295
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,525
She's a star.

296
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,193
- Huh.
- Charlie.

297
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:12,561
This-this could be huge.

298
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:13,863
- Yeah?
- I mean,

299
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,131
I think this really could be a show,

300
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:16,532
with your mom as the star, I mean,

301
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,368
imagine what that would do for your mom.

302
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,702
I mean, w-what do you think?

303
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:20,902
Oh, shit.

304
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:22,638
Well, now I'm thinking

305
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:25,307
about my mom starring
in a show, and I like it.

306
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,777
Um, now I'm thinking about minotaurs.

307
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,314
Now I'm thinking about
a hoagie sandwich.

308
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,715
Now I'm thinking about a glass
of water to go with the chips.

309
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:34,883
How-how many of my
thoughts do you need?

310
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,252
Do you want me to go on and on, or...

311
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,687
No, that's... We're good.

312
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,158
Mom, you know that I think
you are the most captivating

313
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,661
and beautiful woman in
the world, don't you?

314
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:48,296
- No.
- Oh!

315
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,664
I got something for you.

316
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:50,964
Sort of brighten you up a little bit.

317
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,499
What the hell is that?

318
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:53,500
Lipstick.

319
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,501
"Heartbreaker."

320
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:55,904
Just like you.

321
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,238
I ain't wearing no lipstick.

322
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:58,305
Come on, Mom.

323
00:10:58,339 --> 00:10:59,406
Be-be agreeable,

324
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,708
which makes you rootable,

325
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,909
which makes you likeable.

326
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,144
(bleep) you!

327
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,912
That's a joke.

328
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,147
That's a joke, we will
beep that, I think.

329
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,416
He will beep that, and
that'll be... funny.

330
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,718
Uh, you know, let me just, uh,

331
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:11,886
try and put some of this...

332
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,087
Buzz off!

333
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,821
That's good... buzz off.

334
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:17,090
You know, that's like, uh, a call back,

335
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:18,892
which could become a catchphrase.

336
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,094
You should probably think of a few more

337
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,729
so you're not just too one-note.

338
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:23,231
What about, um,

339
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,565
"I can't even."

340
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,935
Or, "That went well."

341
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:30,405
I'm gonna take a shit.

342
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,072
That's not a good catchphrase.

343
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,073
It is healthy, though.

344
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,242
Oh...

345
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:37,278
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

346
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,016
What are you doing?

347
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,285
Just the wacky neighbor, swinging by

348
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,787
with the usual hijinks.

349
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,455
Aga-aga-aga-agoo.

350
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,128
I'm sorry.

351
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,296
Do I hear someone upstairs?

352
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,965
Oh, neighbor!

353
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,267
Just swingin' by to say, "Hello."

354
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:01,802
Will you look at that?

355
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,205
I've got my dumb head
stuck in the banister.

356
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,306
- Dee's a nightmare, dude.
- It's awful.

357
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,142
You're not gonna try
and put a laugh in, or...

358
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,310
Uh, nowhere to put it.

359
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,478
Yeah, you can't tell where the jokes

360
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:11,613
- are supposed to be.
- Exactly.

361
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,147
Whoops. Okay.

362
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,617
It's actually a little bit stuck... Mac?

363
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,985
Mac, you want to come pull on me?

364
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:18,820
Dee, I-I don't know what you're doing,

365
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,588
because n-none of this is playing,

366
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,290
and you're not funny at all and...

367
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,491
Hey, you know what, Dee?

368
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,758
From here, what you're doing

369
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,493
actually is kind of funny.

370
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:27,795
I wish we could get Mac out of there.

371
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:28,713
- Oh, I know.
- Terrible.

372
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:29,783
He's making me sick.

373
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:30,584
- Yeah.
- Ugly.

374
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,635
Mrs. Kelly, can you please help me out?

375
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,838
Uh, my head is really stuck.

376
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,474
Um, I don't do well with emergencies,

377
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,476
and I have to answer the door.

378
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:45,413
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Bonnie.

379
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,014
Just stopping by to
pick up that hard drive

380
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,316
I accidentally left
under the floorboards.

381
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,984
- Oh, come on in.
- Okay.

382
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,820
Man, what is Uncle Jack doing there?

383
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:53,921
- He's awful.
- Yeah, so creepy.

384
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,123
He's gonna ruin the show.

385
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:56,623
Yeah, that creepy pedophile vibe

386
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,325
he's got going on is
going to be a tough sell.

387
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,694
You know, even in Europe.

388
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:00,962
Uh, let me try something here.

389
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,931
Let me take that jacket.

390
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,700
Ooh!

391
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:07,834
Thank you.

392
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:08,935
Mm.

393
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,371
Aw.

394
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,040
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

395
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:14,442
That's funny from over here.

396
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:15,877
Yeah, yeah, just give
me a good push on...

397
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,378
W-what are you doing? Hey,
w-w-what are you doing?

398
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,848
What the hell was that, man?

399
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:22,350
Wh-what, that fart?

400
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:23,618
I'm just trying some new stuff.

401
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:25,353
No, n-n-not
the fart, no.

402
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:26,387
- The fart's good.
- Yeah, no, I'm talking

403
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,889
about the-the sound
effects under my uncle.

404
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,891
- What-what...?
- Well, uh...

405
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:31,225
I'm trying to make him likeable

406
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:32,727
by turning him into the romantic lead.

407
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,860
Romantic lead?

408
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:35,195
They're brother and sister.

409
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:36,863
Yeah, the audience doesn't know that.

410
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:37,964
Well, you know what? I want to see her

411
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:39,132
bang somebody, but not him.

412
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,535
Yeah. All right.

413
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,736
What-what if you make him like a,

414
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,370
like a spy or something, right?

415
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,238
And he's looking for
his hard drive, right?

416
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,241
Because spies are always
looking for hard drives.

417
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:48,743
Or, or, or how about if you write in

418
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:51,579
some scumbag stranger
comes in off the street,

419
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:53,414
and goes to town on Bonnie.

420
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,148
All right, look, I don't
want to over-write this thing.

421
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,983
And-and all of a sudden you want
to turn it into a spy thriller?

422
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,820
- Well...
- That's... I don't want to genre jump.

423
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:00,755
Let-Let's just see how the
romantic lead thing plays out

424
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:01,988
- for a minute here.
- All right.

425
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:03,391
- All right.
- All right?

426
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:05,827
Oh!

427
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:07,394
Ow!

428
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:19,940
Yeah?

429
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:21,608
What... what do you guys think?

430
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:23,578
I mean, um, obviously, the
audio is temp, you know.

431
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,345
But we could keep my
singing voice if you like it.

432
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:28,349
- I like it.
- I like it, and it feels like a real show,

433
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,952
and I love all the letters
flying around on the screen.

434
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,954
- Those are interesting.
- Those are names,

435
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,256
- uh, 'cause it's a credit sequence, which is...
- Okay.

436
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,090
pretty good, but-but why isn't
my mom in the credit sequence?

437
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,926
'Cause I feel like she was popping.

438
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,795
You're lucky your mom's in
the credit sequence at all.

439
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,697
Because I'm writing her
off. She's terrible. Let's...

440
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,297
- Yeah, the word thing you did was good.
- Yeah, it was good, right?

441
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,932
I mean, we got to get
somebody younger in there,

442
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,534
- somebody hipper, somebody who's more fun.
- Yeah.

443
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:49,303
- You know, preferably somebody of color.
- Okay.

444
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:50,937
What are you talking about?
You can't kick my mom out.

445
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,639
She lives in the goddamn house.

446
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,307
Well, I'm gonna cut around her, then.

447
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,476
- Yeah, we're gonna...
- Until the ethnic comes, and then

448
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,445
- we're gonna need your mom's room.
- We're gonna get an ethnic.

449
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,046
- You can't get rid of my mom!
- I'm getting rid of her.

450
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,648
- I'm going to cut around her.
- Mac,

451
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,050
- she's out, she's out.
- I'm gonna...

452
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,552
This is... He thinks she pops.

453
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,953
- She's terrible.
- Yeah.

454
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:08,388
Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly.

455
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,391
- Mrs. Kelly, hold on. Just give me one second.
- Ooh! One, two, three.

456
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,059
- One, two three.
- What? What?

457
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,962
- One, two, three.
- Oh, my God, what?

458
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:17,498
Hi, Frank.

459
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,065
What are you doing here?

460
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:20,301
I came to see you.

461
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:21,736
- Oh!
- Frank, is that you? Hey,

462
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:23,137
come help me out, I'm stuck.

463
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,505
Not now, Deandra.

464
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:27,175
Oh, by the way,

465
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,343
none of the stuff
you're doing is playing.

466
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,845
Except for the fart stuff.

467
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:33,013
What fart stuff?

468
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:36,349
See? You should have
farted after you said that.

469
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,652
Just come help me get out of this thing.

470
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:39,320
- Put a fart in, Dennis.
- What?

471
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:43,490
Oh, goddamn it, what's
Frank doing over there?

472
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,826
I... You know what, I think
he's playing the scumbag

473
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:48,161
who comes in off the
street to bang your mom.

474
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:50,765
Well, I don't want him
banging my mom, dude. Shit.

475
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,002
Oh! Uh, hi, Frank.

476
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,538
I didn't know, uh, Bonnie was

477
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,840
gonna be having company. I
would have put my hands on.

478
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:01,441
How embarrassing.

479
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,510
Get lost. I'm gonna bang your sister.

480
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:04,946
You got it.

481
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,147
Goddamn it, dude,

482
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,849
This is gross. I-I don't want this.

483
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:09,717
Can we turn this into
something else? I mean...

484
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,719
Well, maybe... You know what,
maybe we could turn this into,

485
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:13,554
like, a love triangle thing

486
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,288
between Jack, your mom and Frank?

487
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,291
No, I don't want a
love triangle between...

488
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,959
- Well...
- I don't want any shape of love between them.

489
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,127
That's just gross.

490
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,195
Ooh!

491
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,865
I'll be in the upstairs attic

492
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:27,067
rooting around if anyone needs me.

493
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,236
- Yeah, I do. I need you.
- Oh, I'll be up there, Dee.

494
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,571
- U-Uncle Jack...
- Come on, Bonnie. This boner

495
00:16:30,604 --> 00:16:32,239
- ain't gonna last forever.
- Okay.

496
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:35,867
Yeah. Goddamn it, though,

497
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,168
- he's really gonna bang her?
- Yeah.

498
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,912
Did Mac put a camera in my mom's room?

499
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,581
No, I did.

500
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,051
Listen, people... it does not matter

501
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,888
how you people try to ruin this thing.

502
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,456
I will make it work,
because I'm a genius.

503
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,350
<i>Now look at the... plant!</i>

504
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:55,729
Look at the plant.

505
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:59,179
Now look at the globe.
Up. Back to the plant.

506
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:01,749
Can't cut around her when she's
in every shot, can you, Dennis?

507
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:04,085
- And look at the teddy bear. And the plant.
- Great.

508
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,354
This disgusting bitch is in every shot?

509
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:08,188
I don't want to stand here no more.

510
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:09,856
I got to take another dump.

511
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,693
Oh, look, Mom, no more
shitting, all right?

512
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:15,329
Um... and when you go, are you
not having a full elimination?

513
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,031
I mean, why are you going so much?

514
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,033
Mom?

515
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,834
Mom, where are you?

516
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,169
Don't try and steal focus, Charlie.

517
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,771
- Charlie, can't breathe.
- What? What?

518
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:26,207
Help. Help, Charlie.

519
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,609
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

520
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,945
Mom, look, no more shitting!

521
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:32,712
- Let's go, we got to go where the action is.
- Oh!

522
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,849
Mom! Frank!

523
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,383
Come on, stop banging!

524
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,952
Charlie. What a pleasant surprise.

525
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:40,221
Get off me, man. Get off!

526
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:43,123
- Mom stays in the picture.
- Let's go, come on!

527
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:46,060
- Charlie! I only got to third!
- Come on, get out of here.

528
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,896
Go. You can have any woman you
want... it's got to be my mom?

529
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,296
Hey, come on, what are you doing?

530
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,564
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, Mom,

531
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,467
we got to go where
the action is. Come on.

532
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,901
God... Goddamn it!

533
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:57,571
I was sliding into home, Charlie.

534
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:58,958
- Get out of here, Frank.
- Aw, come on.

535
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,672
Son of a bitch. Get lost!

536
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:02,273
- Charlie!
- Aw...

537
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,044
I can't breathe. You
guys, I'm pretty sure

538
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:05,712
I'm gonna die in this banister.

539
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:08,482
Charlie, what's going on?

540
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:11,252
Look, I'm coming clean. We've
been watching you guys, right?

541
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:14,421
The presents that we brought
over... they're hidden cameras.

542
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,724
The teddy bear, the
globe... all that shit.

543
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:18,391
I don't know how you
didn't see it. And then we

544
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,061
turned it into a show.
The show was pretty good.

545
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,761
We had chips. But look...
this all started 'cause you

546
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:24,064
sent me this in the
mail. I got freaked out.

547
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:26,667
Well, I sent it to you
because I missed you,

548
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,256
I wanted to see more of you.

549
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:30,904
That's all that is? It's not
because you feel trapped

550
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:32,605
in your own home and you
guys are fighting too much

551
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:33,908
or whatever it is?

552
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,677
No. We get along great.

553
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:40,747
Oh, but this makes me
feel so much better.

554
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:43,117
Now that I know that you're watching me.

555
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:46,286
My mom feels the same way.

556
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,289
And she also says that she loves me

557
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:50,757
- and misses me.
- Well, shoot,

558
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,958
all right, well, why
don't we bring it on in

559
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,461
- for a hug, huh?
- Okay!

560
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:56,362
This was all just one
big misunderstanding.

561
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,966
Get off me, dude. Get off.
What are you doing? Get off.

562
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:16,784
I got to say it: that's the
best episode yet. That is!

563
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,678
- It's a classic!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I love the button at the ending.

564
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:20,988
- Yeah?
- Oh, that was the biggest joke

565
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,723
- in the show. The biggest moment.
- It was, it was. - Was it?

566
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:25,325
- I mean it, really.
- Oh, well, guys, look, I told you...

567
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,727
- I know my physical comedy.
- Yeah.

568
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:29,497
- Right?
- Okay, yeah.

569
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:30,797
- Oh! - Oh! -
What are you doing?

570
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:31,998
- What's wrong?
- Hey.

571
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:33,801
Show's been canceled, guys.

572
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,135
- What?!
- Wha...

573
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,138
I got a four-episode sex arc.

574
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,972
Nah, nah. You know,
now-now that everybody knows

575
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,976
they're being filmed, it's
more like a reality TV show,

576
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,310
and I just can't enjoy it when
the people who are being filmed

577
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:45,845
- know they're being filmed.
- Yeah, but what about

578
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:47,915
our show, man? What about
making my mom famous?

579
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,583
- It's just not funny anymore.
- Oh, oh,

580
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,271
oh, oh... I know how to make it funny.

581
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:53,921
Oh!

582
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,523
- What?
- Oh, I...

583
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,689
I just shit my pants.

584
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:58,526
- Oh, God!
- Oh! - Oh, God.

585
00:19:58,558 --> 00:19:59,759
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

586
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:01,161
- Oh, Dee.
- That's not funny.

587
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,696
I just meant to fart. I didn't...

588
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,430
- I didn't...
- Oh, my God! Without the laugh track

589
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,500
- that's, like, really horrible.
- Yeah, you're just

590
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,035
a grown woman who shit her pants.

591
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:15,709
Now it's funny again.

592
