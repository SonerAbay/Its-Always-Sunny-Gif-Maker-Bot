00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,328
maybe it would help if I saw the
original Mel Gibson version

150
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,998
first. W-What do you mean that
you've not seen... Wha...? How...?

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,833
You've never seen...
<i>Lethal Weapon?</i>

152
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,969
<i>Lethal Weapon?</i>
<i>No, I mean, I've heard of it.</i>

153
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,038
<i>I think what's happening here</i>
<i>is the fact that you're a woman,</i>

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,806
<i>and our demographic skews male.</i>
<i>Well, um...</i>

155
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,541
<i>It does-- we are a male-</i>
<i>driven, uh, you know...</i>

156
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,376
<i>We are testosterone-driven.</i>
<i>We're a male-driven entity.</i>

157
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,145
<i>I-I got, I got that.</i>
<i>Oh, oh, oh, the next scene.</i>

158
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:32,880
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right,</i>
<i>right, right, right, right.</i>

159
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,815
<i>Oh, the next scene.</i>
<i>That's right, there's stuff</i>

160
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,550
<i>for the... the ladies, I guess.</i>
<i>Oh, for the ladies.</i>

161
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:38,485
<i>Yeah, we shot this for the</i>
<i>ladies.</i>

162
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,788
<i>This is all</i> for the ladies.
You're gonna love this.

163
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,756
Well... yeah.
You're gonna dive right in,

164

right here.

All right, buddy.

Now that we know what Lazarus'
plan is, what are we gonna do?

179
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,955
We got to track him down and

00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:49,890
Sure do.
We got to track him down and

181
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:51,692
punch him.
We're gonna track him down

182
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,427
and we're gonna...
We're gonna go to the strip

club, which I'm excited to do.
I love strip clubs.

Oh, baby, I love me a good

We're gonna...
I mean, this is crazy, right?

Wha...?
I miss her, Riggs.

Nothing's ever gonna make me

Lazarus has taken everything

189
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,817
from us, but we're gonna take
what he loves most: his life.

190
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,386
Yeah?
Well, we'd better do it right

191
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:23,924
this time, baby.
We ain't getting any younger.

192

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,130

<i>Oh, goddamn it, Mac.</i>
<i>Gay yasak movie?</i>

216
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,843
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>See? See!</i>

217
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,145
<i>You even watching the movie?</i>
<i>Yes, in a lot of ways this is a</i>

218
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:19,813
<i>love story between two men.</i>
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

219
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,715
<i>Okay, yes, in a... most</i> ways.
No, it isn't.

220
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,484
All right, but this is about
as masculine as it gets.

221
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:25,619
It's not, it's not, I mean...
No, it isn't, no, it isn't.

222
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,521
You had a butt-double.
Oh, of course I had a butt-

223
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:29,623
double.
You think I'm gonna show my butt

224
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,291
on camera, Charlie?
Oh, my God, I was

225
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,293
uncomfortable filming the scene.
It's not up to the par of

226
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,128
Murtaugh, okay?
If you play the movie, you'll

227
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,964
see...
It gets way straighter, I

228
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,966
promise.
Push play, you're gonna love

229
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,968
this next part.
We'll cut that stuff out.

230
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,670
See, nobody wants that...

231
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:51,011
I sure am glad we came to
this strip club, Riggs.

232
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,747
I do like looking at
beautiful naked women.

233
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:56,750
That's because we're not gay.
Right, right.

234
00:12:56,752 --> 00:13:00,487
Up next is Lady Starship.
She's gonna blow you away with

235
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,090
her celestial body.
Lady Starship--

Oh, what the f... ♪

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:22,743
That's more like it.

Yeah. You like that?
I do, yeah.

240
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:27,481
What are you looking at, man?
Shit.

241
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:30,283
Frank, will you pay
attention, man?

242
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,925
I mean, come on, we've been all
over town.

243
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,160
We went to a hedge fund guy, a
dot-com girl, we went to banks.

244
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,363
No one's gonna fund this thing.
No, we need to finish the

245
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,365
movie, Frank.
All right, I'll give you the

246
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,067
money.
But we do the movie my way.

247
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,270
I want... what I want.
And you know what I want.

248
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,072
That's not cool, man.
We can make it work, we'll

249
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,574
just have to add some
exposition-- a whole scene

250
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,075
of it.
What needs to be explained?

251
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,710
It's gonna be perfectly clear!

252
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:52,712
It's gonna be way too clear
what's happening.

253
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:54,347
Frank, it's gonna ruin the
movie, Frank!

254
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,683
It's gonna be <i>so</i> confusing...
It's not gonna be... it's not

255
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:00,186
gonna be confusing.
We got a deal or what?

256
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:08,928
Ah! Damn.
Damn! They found us!

257
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,765
We got Lazarus trapped in his

258
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,634
own umbrella factory.
Yeah. He gonna do a rain dance

259
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,103
and then make some money on some
umbrellas, man.

260
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,305
He a dirty bitch.

261
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:22,742
Come on, let's go get him.

262
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:25,412
I'm gonna jump over this!

263
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:28,381
Get over it!
I got you, Riggs! Hurry up!

264
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,152
Oh, I'm getting too old for

265
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,787
this shit.
Come on, man!

266
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:38,258
We're pinned down, Rog.

267
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,895
This could be it, good buddy.
This could be the end.

268
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:45,265
Okay, Rog, if this is the
end, we should be the ones to

269
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:48,735
end it.
You know what? I got this.

270
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:05,018
I got that weird Danish twin.

271
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,455
Oh, shit!

272
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:13,993
Aw, damn! He got away.

273
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:17,363
Oh, hey, you know what?
We got to also remember to get

274
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:20,333
that shaman priestess from the
beginning.

275
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:23,169
We don't want her bringing him
back from the dead...

276
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:27,540
again.
That's a good point.

277
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,542
Where's Mac?
He's in the bathroom.

278
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,544
Well, that's not gonna work.
I mean, we can't...

279
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,980
It's fine, just go, let's go.
He's in the bathroom.

280
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,149
He's in the bathroom.
Charlie, it's not... we

281
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:41,321
can't... I mean, it's...

282
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,793
Oh, shit!
Rog, I'm out of bullets!

283
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:51,231
You are? Oh, I'm out of
bullets, too, Riggs. Oh, no!

284
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:55,902
Time to kiss L.A. good-bye,
suckers!

285
00:15:55,904 --> 00:16:02,308
'Cause tonight the forecast
calls for rain!

286
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,711
Riggs, there's a basketball

287
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,713
right there.
You should use it.

288
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,183
I know.
Wha... Oh!

289
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,152
Oh, shit, Rog.
If you make this shot, you will

290
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,421
have redeemed yourself with the
item that you failed with in the

291
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,857
beginning.
That is right.

292
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:22,095
I can do it, Riggs.
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

293
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,464
In your face, sucker.

294
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:41,614
Yeah, buddy, you did it!
You did exactly what you said

295
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,716
you were gonna do, and now he's
dead.

296
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:45,919
And now we have to kill that
shaman woman so that she doesn't

297
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,454
come back and reanimate him
again.

298
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:52,091
Wait.
I got a better idea first.

299
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:54,193
What is it?
Let me just show you, man,

300
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,696
will you?
We don't have to say everything,

301
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,333
man. Shit.♪

302
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:07,907
You know you always have my
blessin', partner.

303
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,478
That's my partner right there.

304
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,481
Yeah.
And that's a callback.

305
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:17,750
From the beginning-- so it's
come full circle.

306
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,819
We know.
And then we brought you back

307
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,789
from the dead.
Well, the shaman did it.

308
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,125
And then we killed her.
Because we didn't want her to

309
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,295
bring back Lazarus.
Okay. We get it.

310
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:32,966
Go ahead.
Kiss her.

311
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:37,604
Kiss her.
Kiss her, man.

312
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:43,242
Yeah.
Come on, man.

313
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:11,304
One last thing, in case I die.

314
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:26,719
Oh, my God! Oh!

315
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:32,058
S-So again, this is what we

316
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,188
were trying to avoid by coming
to you in the first place.

317
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:46,456
