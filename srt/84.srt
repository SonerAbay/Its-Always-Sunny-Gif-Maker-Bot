1
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:04,134
Attention!

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:05,135
Attention, everyone!

3
00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:06,103
Gather round, please!

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,104
Gather round!

5
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:09,268
Mac has a very
important announcement!

6
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:12,907
Because of my sudden and
unfortunate weight loss, the bar

7
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:15,342
is now in extreme risk.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,676
And as head of security,
this concerns me.

9
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:20,776
So Mac's made a couple of moves.

10
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:24,546
And that first move... is this.

11
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:25,547
SWEET DEE: Jesus Christ.

12
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:26,548
Jesus.

13
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:27,982
Perfect for ocular pat-downs.

14
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,451
Now I can determine a subject's threat
level without him being able to feel my

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,452
retinal assessment.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,486
Which is a great advantage because
the guy can't see how scared Mac is.

17
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:37,655
Yes, and... No, that's not
what it's about. It's not...

18
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:40,692
Huh? Oh, I thought that you were
scared every time you went to go to...

19
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:41,694
That's classified!

20
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:43,662
Look, this whole point is to
make them feel safer, all right?

21
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:44,663
We <i>don't</i> feel safer.

22
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,631
And, Mac, there will never come a
time where you will need those.

23
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:50,001
Mark my words, Dennis,
there will come a time when I will

24
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,802
utilize these glasses to
assess a threat and then...

25
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,802
Are they still standing there?

26
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,803
No, they walked away.

27
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:57,773
My peripheral is a
little compromised.

28
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,842
Yeah, you can't see out the sides,
and that's a disadvantage, so...

29
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,710
Oh, good... you're all here.

30
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:05,046
Who invited the Jew lawyer?

31
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,113
Not Jewish.

32
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:08,483
Hold on, punk.

33
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:16,891
He's clear.

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,926
He's clear.

35
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,295
You know, I-I really do
not understand you people.

36
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,031
You know, it's funny, most of
the time I'm trying to get away

37
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,634
from you, and yet when I really
need to get in touch with you,

38
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:27,735
I can't get you to
return my phone calls.

39
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,770
Mmm, don't need you, don't care.

40
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,405
Eh... out you go.

41
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,606
Lovely.

42
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,342
As the executor of your mother's estate,
I'm here to inform you

43
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:40,114
that her father, Heinrich Landgraf,
has fallen into a coma.

44
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,248
Pop-Pop?

45
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,417
He's being kept alive
by a respirator.

46
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:46,052
As per the will, the only
living blood relatives, the

47
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:48,688
ever-charming Dee and Dennis
Reynolds are the only people

48
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:52,659
empowered to decide whether or
not he stays on those machines.

49
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:55,294
Are you saying that we have to
decide whether that old Nazi

50
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:56,528
bitch lives or dies?

51
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:57,783
There's that charm.

52
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,421
That is correct.

53
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,267
I'll await your decision.

54
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:20,497
Sync & corrections by 

55
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,508
Pop-Pop's room's right down here.

56
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:37,821
How do you know, Frank?

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,725
I come here every week and feed
him soup, take care of him.

58
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:41,692
That's nice of you, you know?

59
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,270
Help a man keep his dignity
in his final years.

60
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,854
Somebody's got to do it.

61
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,033
Oh! Oh! Oh!

62
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,335
Oh, Jesus Christ!

63
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,336
Ugh!

64
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,305
I didn't have a chance to tidy.

65
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,506
T... Tidy?

66
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,041
Frank, the man is rotting.

67
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,011
Oh, God, why hasn't someone
done something in here?

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,113
I told the staff I got it.

69
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,114
You <i>don't</i> got it.

70
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,082
You don't have it at all.

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,084
Yeah, what is the
overwhelming smell?

72
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,051
Oh, that's the soup.

73
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,187
Yeah, well, if he doesn't finish,
sometimes I leave 'em

74
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,689
for him, and then I forget
and then months go by.

75
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,693
Jesus Christ, Frank, what the
hell is really going on here?

76
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,797
Look, the guy always said he
had Nazi treasure stashed away.

77
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,566
I figure I spend some time with him,
he gives it to me.

78
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:25,536
All right, well, pretty good plan;
execution leaves a lot to be desired.

79
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,373
Okay, well, speaking of execution,
we're just gonna pull

80
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,375
the plug on this creep and
get out of here, right?

81
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,445
Whoa. Whoa, h-hold on a second, Dee,
I mean, that's a big decision.

82
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,447
How so?

83
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,449
We're talking about
taking a man's life.

84
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:38,818
Yeah, but he was a Nazi,
so it's kind of, like, eh...

85
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,053
Well, yeah, I get that, but,
I mean, he was our grandfather.

86
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:43,055
Okay, maybe we got to think
this through a little bit more.

87
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:44,023
Yeah.

88
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:46,026
Oh, my God,
make a decision already!

89
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,994
Are you eating the soup?!

90
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:48,995
Is he eating the soup?

91
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:49,596
Yes.

92
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,596
I'm sorry. I was hungry.

93
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,565
I made a decision to eat the soup.

94
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,600
I didn't sit around thinking all day,
"Hey, do I do this?

95
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,601
Do I not do this?"

96
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,436
We are making a decision about
whether or not to take a

97
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,605
man's life, not whether or
not to eat old rancid soups.

98
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,607
Okay, listen, I think we just
need to gather a little bit more

99
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,576
information before we
make our decision, right?

100
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,545
Yeah, you guys think it over,
think it over.

101
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,781
Mac, can you come
here for a second?

102
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,083
What?

103
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:13,919
All Frank's talk about Nazi treasure...
got me thinking about something.

104
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:18,557
Okay, you remember that box of stuff
Pop-Pop gave me a few years ago?

105
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:22,227
It was, like, all this old stuff,
Nazi shit that he got from the war?

106
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:25,530
Holy shit!

107
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,068
Yeah. Didn't we burn
that all in the alley?

108
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:32,038
Not all of it.

109
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:36,409
There was a painting in that box,
a very special dog painting

110
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:37,843
that I mounted on my wall.

111
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:41,881
You and my dad share this futon?

112
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,117
Now, Frank hated this
painting, you know?

113
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:45,084
He made me take it down.

114
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:48,054
I do not like this painting,
Charlie.

115
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,857
Its smug aura mocks me.

116
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:53,593
It's evil, Charlie.

117
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,161
Evil.

118
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,530
And it's been in
that box ever since.

119
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,266
Uh-huh. So what?

120
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,303
By the way, man, this is why we
work well together, you know?

121
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,305
You see free soup,
you make a decision to eat it.

122
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,272
It's horrible.

123
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,908
It's terrible soup, but we got to
stick with our decisions, right?

124
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,509
Yeah, I can't go back on it now.

125
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,980
No, no. All right, anyway...
do you think that that painting

126
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,516
could've been the Nazi treasure
that Frank's looking for?

127
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,917
Mm. I've made a decision.

128
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:19,885
Yes.

129
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:20,486
Yes, right?

130
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:21,487
Yeah.

131
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,456
Okay. You got to help me find it.

132
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,458
Let's slip out of here
so they don't notice.

133
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,860
Okay. They're standing two feet
away from us, so they <i>are</i>

134
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,829
<i>gonna notice, but let's just run out
of here; they'll think we</i>

135
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,499
<i>made a quick decision to leave.</i>

136
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,738
<i>Damn it, dude!</i>

137
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,873
<i>All right, I remember exactly
what happened, all right?</i>

138
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,442
<i>Frank took it down, told me to get
rid of it; I stashed it away</i>

139
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,411
<i>somewhere, but then what-what
happened to it from there,</i>

140
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,412
<i>I don't know.</i>

141
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,647
<i>Hey, Charlie, come here.</i>

142
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,815
<i>Dude, you got to check this out.</i>

143
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:53,118
<i>Look at all these old photos of
Hitler with German shepherds.</i>

144
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,486
<i>Oh, holy shit.</i>

145
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,556
<i>Yeah. But check this out.</i>

146
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,191
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

147
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,428
<i>Yeah. Hitler painted German
shepherds all the time.</i>

148
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,495
<i>He was, like, obsessed.</i>

149
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:08,801
<i>Dude, I'm thinking that maybe
that painting could be...</i>

150
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,768
<i>An original Hitler.</i>

151
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:10,402
<i>Yes!</i>

152
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,403
<i>Yeah!</i>

153
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,372
<i>Holy shit, dude, this is huge!</i>

154
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,974
<i>We are gonna become famous
treasure hunters.</i>

155
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>I'm thinking, Hollywood is gonna
make a Da Vinci Code</i> style

156
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:18,745
thriller about us!

157
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,079
I can finally be Indiana Jones!

158
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,048
Yeah, yeah, and then I
get it back on my wall!

159
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,450
Yeah. Well, we're not gonna
put it back up on your wall.

160
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,952
It'll probably go in a museum.

161
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,187
What? No-no-no-no-no.

162
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:28,154
It looks so good here.

163
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,156
It belongs in a museum,
and that's the end of this.

164
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,125
Okay, you know what,
can you call Frank?

165
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,593
Because he's gonna
remember the details.

166
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,362
I knew that I stashed it away somewhere,
but it's-it's gone.

167
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,330
I can't find it.

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,331
Do we have to involve Frank?

169
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,300
You know what, yeah, we'll just
tiptoe around the language.

170
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,301
I'll play it cool.

171
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,302
Just play it cool.

172
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,137
Mac!

173
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,139
Hey, Frank.

174
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,106
Where are you?

175
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,107
You sound strained.

176
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,343
I'm stuck in a window
over at Pop-Pop's house.

177
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:51,744
I got to find this treasure.

178
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,446
Treasure, what treasure?

179
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,115
I don't even know what you're talking about.
There probably is no treasure.

180
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:57,817
I'll bet you there's no treasure,
so you can just stop

181
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,384
looking for the treasure, okay,
'cause there's no treasure.

182
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,320
Hey, man, you know where that,
um, worthless old dog painting

183
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,757
that you had hanging up in your apartment-
do you know where that might be?

184
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,892
The dog painting? Oh!

185
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:08,860
That was evil.

186
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,028
I threw that thing out.

187
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,396
I'm pretty sure I saw Cricket
scampering away with it.

188
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,631
Cricket?

189
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,632
Hey, listen, Mac.

190
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,599
You do me a favor.

191
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm really stuck in this window.

192
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,601
Will you come and get me?

193
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,569
Okay, nice.

194
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,770
We got to get Cricket.

195
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,106
I know just where to find him.

196
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,274
Dust is a nice touch.

197
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:26,709
Yes. I don't like you
wearing the glasses, though.

198
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,045
They're supposed
to assess a threat.

199
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:31,447
Oh, Cricket could be a threat.

200
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:33,482
No, I have cleared him
on multiple occasions.

201
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:34,483
Here we go. Hello!

202
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:35,651
Hey, Cricks.

203
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,886
Dog pound, huh? Weird.

204
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:38,987
Wow.

205
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:39,955
Oh!

206
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,190
Ugh. Ooh.

207
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,358
Oh, Jesus Christ, that's gruesome.

208
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:45,494
Yeah, I got into a skirmish
with a stray chocolate lab.

209
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:49,798
I won't go into details, but suffice to say,
that dog is very paralyzed now.

210
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:53,302
Anyway, they got me doing this, uh,
this community service thing.

211
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:56,205
Yeah, but I'm kind of a dog executioner,
so, uh, looks like

212
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,674
old Cricket got the last laugh.

213
00:07:58,743 --> 00:07:59,875
Wow.

214
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,076
Yeah.

215
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,078
You're putting the dogs down?

216
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,212
Well, uh, no.

217
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,648
You know, yeah, mostly just, you know,
cleaning up the poops, you

218
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,017
know, washing out their cages,
that kind of thing.

219
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:10,353
Ah. Sounds like you're
a dog janitor then.

220
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,655
Yeah, that's more like <i>they
got the last laugh.</i>

221
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,091
<i>Cricks, Frank said you know something
about a dog painting</i>

222
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,527
<i>that he threw away that you might
have scampered off with.</i>

223
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:18,594
<i>Yeah, worthless</i> dog painting.

224
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,796
Yeah, yeah, dog painting,
sure, yeah.

225
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:21,998
Oh, very evil vibes.

226
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,166
Yeah, I sold it.

227
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,367
To who?

228
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:25,368
Hmm? Oh, some guy.

229
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:27,403
You know, he's coming down here,
he's all bent out of shape, you

230
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,538
know, that he had to put
down his German shepherd.

231
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:33,275
Well, I notice his dog looks just
like the one in the painting.

232
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:34,709
I see an opportunity.

233
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,411
Make three bucks. Ba-da-boom!

234
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,014
Wait.

235
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:43,618
He's cool. He's not a threat.

236
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:44,819
Phew!

237
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:45,786
I know he's not a threat!

238
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,788
I told you, I've assessed him...
I've just cleared him.

239
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:50,924
You are not using the glasses correctly,
and it's driving me crazy, okay?

240
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:51,891
I thought I used it.

241
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,893
Could you tell how scared I was?

242
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:53,894
No, I could not. I could not.

243
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,062
Mara?

244
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,296
Uh, yeah, boss.

245
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,332
Got a mastiff in here,
just had explosive diarrhea.

246
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:01,168
I've never seen anything like it.
Get your ass in here.

247
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:02,712
Come on.

248
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:09,838
Hello? Somebody there?

249
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,242
Help me out of here!

250
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,545
I'm stuck! I can't get out of here!

251
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,240
Frank? What is happening?

252
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,426
What are you doing?

253
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:17,394
I'm trapped.

254
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,397
That goddamn trunk
is booby-trapped.

255
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:22,366
It's not booby-trapped, Frank; it's an
empty trunk, and you fell into it like a

256
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,534
Weeble wobble.

257
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:24,569
Let's go. Come on.

258
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,905
Jesus!

259
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:27,906
Oh! Oh! Oh!

260
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:29,941
Oh, God.

261
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,145
Frank, there's no point in you
looking for a treasure, okay?

262
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,280
If there's anything of value in this house,
we are the ones who

263
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:36,481
inherit it once he dies.

264
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,683
You're wasting your time.

265
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:38,851
I mean, it's crazy.

266
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,020
Dennis, check out these old films-
"New Years '74,"

267
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,021
"Thanksgiving '68."

268
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,255
Way.

269
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:44,090
"Summer Camp '81."

270
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:44,990
'81? Oh, that's us.

271
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:45,992
That's our summer camp.

272
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,226
Yeah, that's us. Yeah.

273
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,094
Fire that up.

274
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:49,095
I want to check that out.

275
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:51,297
Oh, see, Frank, Dee and I have
been talking, and I don't think

276
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:53,333
we're gonna... I don't think
we're gonna off Pop-Pop.

277
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,335
You know, I mean, yeah, sure,
the guy's got a little bit of a

278
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,506
sordid past, absolutely, but you know,
everybody deserves a second chance.

279
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:00,875
Yeah, he was just following orders.

280
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:02,043
You know what I mean?

281
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:05,046
Yeah. Let's not try and justify why
a man would join the Nazis and...

282
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:06,915
Right. Right, right, right, yeah,
I see what you're saying.

283
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,684
'Cause that's gonna get us too far
away from... We won't be able to...

284
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:11,452
...the point that we're
trying to make, which is that

285
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:14,321
the man moved to America, you know,
to put all that horrible shit behind him.

286
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,322
Right. Right.

287
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:18,291
And he wanted to turn his life around,
and that's what he did, Frank.

288
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,292
He turned his life around.

289
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:20,259
People do that.

290
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,093
People do that. Exactly.

291
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,094
Oh, here we go. Look at me.

292
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,095
Oh!

293
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,064
Oh, God, you remember that car?

294
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,065
Yes.

295
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:28,067
Oh, look at those
two little rug rats.

296
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:28,901
Oh, I was so cute!

297
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,669
Oh, man, and look at Pop...
Look at how sweet he is!

298
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,671
Yeah, God, he was a sweet guy.

299
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,639
This is great.

300
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:34,640
That's the camp.

301
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:35,641
Oh, we loved it there.

302
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,509
God, it's... it's all
flooding back to me now.

303
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:38,410
Did we wear those uniforms?

304
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,411
I don't remember those. Do you?

305
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,913
I don't remember that.

306
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:42,147
But yeah, see if there's sound.

307
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,450
I want to... I'd like
to pop some sound on.

308
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,284
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,385
Look at this guy.

310
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:47,320
Remember this guy? Ah.

311
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,220
I totally remember that guy.

312
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,988
He was always so jazzed
up about everything.

313
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,891
He was so excited, and he would get
us all excited, do you remember that?

314
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Get the whole crowd jazzed up,
the whole camp.

315
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,128
Here we go.

316
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,532
That is why it is so important
that we all must unify.

317
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:04,603
The more we come together,
the stronger we become.

318
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:05,938
Now, listen close, kids.

319
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,307
These goddamn niggers and Jews
are trying to take over this

320
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,743
country, and we've
got to take it back!

321
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:11,878
Oops.

322
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,079
Yeah.

323
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:14,080
That just took a turn.

324
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,248
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

325
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,082
<i>Sieg heil! Sieg heil!</i>

326
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:18,518
<i>Oh, that's us.</i>

327
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:20,587
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm doing that.</i>

328
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:23,523
<i>Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg... Okay,
that settles it.</i>

329
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:24,691
<i>Let's fry this turkey.</i>

330
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,859
<i>Yes.</i>

331
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>All set?</i>

332
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:29,029
<i>Ready?</i>

333
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:30,030
<i>Whoa, whoa, hang on.</i>

334
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:31,031
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

335
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,234
<i>Are you sure you want
to watch him die?</i>

336
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:35,669
<i>What do you mean, watch him die?
We have to watch him die?</i>

337
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,105
<i>Well, you do something like pull the plug,
and you got to</i>

338
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:40,440
<i>stay there until the
lights go out.</i>

339
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:42,676
<i>You know, maybe we need to
experience that on a smaller</i>

340
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,045
<i>scale first, and just kind of
see how we feel about it?</i>

341
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:48,415
<i>Kill something less
important first.</i>

342
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:49,716
<i>See what that does inside.</i>

343
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:51,985
<i>Move up.</i>

344
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,387
<i>I have an idea.</i>

345
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,257
<i>You want to watch a dog
get put down?</i>

346
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:58,692
<i>Yeah, we want to see how it feels.</i>

347
00:11:58,761 --> 00:11:59,927
<i>Great. I got just the one.</i>

348
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:02,297
<i>Ah, I feel like we need
to pick the dog.</i>

349
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:03,498
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

350
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,867
<i>'Cause we need to feel the full
weight of the decision.</i>

351
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,069
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

352
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,002
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

353
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,775
<i>No.</i>

354
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,145
<i>Oh, no.</i>

355
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,579
<i>Come on. No.</i>

356
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,184
<i>Uh... no.</i>

357
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:19,929
<i>Oh. No!</i>

358
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:23,090
<i>Oh. Come on, guy. No!</i>

359
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,736
<i>Pick me?</i>

360
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:27,937
<i>What?</i>

361
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,571
<i>Put me down! Pick me!</i>

362
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,739
<i>I deserve it.</i>

363
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,675
<i>Okay. New plan.</i>

364
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,077
<i>We're doing the right thing,
Dennis.</i>

365
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,045
<i>We're not killers.</i>

366
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,279
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

367
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,515
<i>No, we have to think about
ourselves here.</i>

368
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,783
<i>I don't want to live with pulling
the plug on somebody.</i>

369
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,019
<i>No. Let's just let Pop-Pop and
Cricket and these dogs die</i>

370
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,220
<i>as nature intended.</i>

371
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,421
<i>Slowly and painfully.</i>

372
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,623
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

373
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,592
<i>All right.</i>

374
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,793
<i>All right, guys.</i>

375
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:51,794
<i>Here we go.</i>

376
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:52,896
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

377
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:54,064
<i>Go, get out of here.</i>

378
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:55,198
<i>Go and be free. Go and be free.</i>

379
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,400
<i>Oh, we're all free.</i>

380
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,568
<i>There we go.</i>

381
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:58,802
<i>Go on.</i>

382
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,004
<i>We're all free. Yeah.</i>

383
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,806
<i>I'm one of you guys.</i>

384
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,142
<i>All right, so this is the address.</i>

385
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,343
<i>All right.</i>

386
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:06,544
<i>This is the spot, huh?</i>

387
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:07,479
<i>Here.</i>

388
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:10,082
<i>Okay. "Bret Da Lawyer,
a Denial Correlation."</i>

389
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,250
<i>What does that mean?</i>

390
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:12,451
<i>Pretty good. That's close.</i>

391
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,053
<i>It's "Brett DeLauter,
a Dental Corporation."</i>

392
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:16,221
<i>Guy's a dentist.</i>

393
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,623
<i>Huh. All right,
let's check it out.</i>

394
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:19,958
<i>Yeah.</i>

395
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,394
<i>Whoa.</i>

396
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:24,029
<i>Wow.</i>

397
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,197
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

398
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,399
<i>Mac, look. There it is.</i>

399
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:27,633
<i>Oh.</i>

400
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:31,337
<i>Holy shit, this dentist must have
gone insane after his dog died.</i>

401
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,538
<i>I mean, look at this.</i>

402
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:35,241
<i>Charlie, I'm beginning to think
that we may have stumbled</i>

403
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,943
<i>onto one of the greatest
discoveries of modern times.</i>

404
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:39,111
<i>Follow me here.</i>

405
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,848
<i>What if the key to Adolf Hitler's
madness was the death</i>

406
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,084
<i>of his dog?</i>

407
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,085
<i>What?</i>

408
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,020
<i>Okay, when he was a kid,
he had this little, sweet, little</i>

409
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,754
<i>puppy, and he was the happiest
chap in all of Germany.</i>

410
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,456
<i>Right, "I love chocolate.
I love my dogs."</i>

411
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:54,459
<i>Yeah, but then his beloved pet was
ripped from him, and he</i>

412
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:55,993
<i>was like, "That's it.</i>

413
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:59,597
<i>I'm totally going to kill everybody,
take over the world."</i>

414
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:00,564
<i>That is what happened.</i>

415
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,566
<i>I mean, that's definitely
what happened.</i>

416
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,401
<i>Oh, hi, you must be Mr.</i>

417
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,369
<i>Miller.</i>

418
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:06,370
<i>No.</i>

419
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,371
<i>Yeah.</i>

420
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,606
<i>Ready for those braces?</i>

421
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:11,508
<i>Yeah, but I wanted the... Yeah,
we can go in.</i>

422
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:12,509
<i>Yeah.</i>

423
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:13,410
<i>We can pop in real quick.</i>

424
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,212
<i>Yep.</i>

425
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,648
<i>Dude, I'm telling you,
this is like The Da Vinci Code.</i>

426
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:20,285
<i>Oh, man, I wonder who's
going to play me.</i>

427
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:22,354
<i>I was thinking maybe
Mark Wahlberg.</i>

428
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,755
<i>What do you think?</i>

429
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:26,025
<i>Hmm, no, you're right,
he couldn't match my intensity.</i>

430
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,160
<i>Ryan Gosling-- it's locked in.</i>

431
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:28,061
<i>It's gonna be Ryan Gosling.</i>

432
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,896
<i>I can't wait to get that painting
back up on my wall.</i>

433
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:30,730
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

434
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,599
<i>That's what this is really all about
when you think about it.</i>

435
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,634
<i>No, that's not what this is about.</i>

436
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:37,037
<i>This is about ripping open the
fabric of historical fact and</i>

437
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:39,105
<i>making a film about it starring
Ryan Gosling as Mac.</i>

438
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:41,141
<i>Okay, well, I'll play Hitler,
then.</i>

439
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,142
<i>That'd be cool.</i>

440
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,212
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

441
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,228
<i>I play Hitler in the movie.</i>

442
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:46,556
<i>Okay, Hitler's not even in it.</i>

443
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,735
<i>It takes place in present day.</i>

444
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,850
<i>Oh, it could be a time-
traveling thing.</i>

445
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,751
<i>I see what you're saying.</i>

446
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,719
<i>So then Hitler comes back from the past,
he joins us on our</i>

447
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,788
<i>adventure, we go on a big
caper together.</i>

448
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,690
<i>There's no, there's no time
travel in this movie.</i>

449
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,459
<i>It's gonna be a classic
like Citizen Kane.</i>

450
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,261
<i>Time travel movies are classic.</i>

451
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:04,120
<i>This is gonna be-- this is...
You're driving me-- oh, my God.</i>

452
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,043
<i>What?</i>

453
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:09,377
<i>Mac, I need you to convince Dennis
and Deandra not to pull</i>

454
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:10,912
<i>the plug on Pop-Pop.</i>

455
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,913
<i>Why?</i>

456
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,982
<i>Because I haven't found
his treasure yet.</i>

457
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,984
<i>I need more time.</i>

458
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,051
<i>Okay, Frank, here's the deal.</i>

459
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,288
<i>Pop-Pop does have treasure,
and I'll let you in on it if you</i>

460
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,290
<i>help me because Charlie is
driving me bananas.</i>

461
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,793
<i>He's becoming a threat to
this whole operation.</i>

462
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:28,129
<i>Then you're going to have to take
him out of the picture.</i>

463
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:29,831
<i>Get rid of him.</i>

464
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,534
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

465
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,637
<i>Hey, Charlie, you know, I was thinking,
maybe you could play</i>

466
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:35,604
<i>Hitler.</i>

467
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:36,439
<i>Of course.</i>

468
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,506
<i>I think you've got the range.</i>

469
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:38,374
<i>I know I do, Mac.</i>

470
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:39,876
<i>And I think you're right.</i>

471
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:42,478
<i>I mean, the leader of the Third Reich
defying laws of physics to</i>

472
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,146
<i>join us in our present-day adventure-
that makes sense.</i>

473
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:44,981
<i>It's a better movie.</i>

474
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:45,815
<i>Good call.</i>

475
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,784
<i>Yeah, I've also decided to direct.</i>

476
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:48,985
<i>Mm-hmm, let's lock that in.</i>

477
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:51,254
<i>Yeah, is that...?</i>

478
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:53,822
<i>What is-- what are you doing?</i>

479
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:54,957
<i>Why are you doing that?</i>

480
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,125
<i>Hmm?</i>

481
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:07,048
<i>Oh, I am so happy that you have
decided to end this.</i>

482
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:10,443
<i>As soon as we get this little issue
resolved, I'll no longer</i>

483
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:13,728
<i>have a legal obligation
to deal with you.</i>

484
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,217
<i>Yeah, it's not really resolved, I think,
in the sense that you were hoping for.</i>

485
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:18,218
<i>No.</i>

486
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,392
<i>When we said we were gonna end this,
we didn't mean "kill."</i>

487
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,195
<i>Not end it.</i>

488
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:22,575
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

489
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:23,509
<i>We're not going to do it.</i>

490
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:24,410
<i>We're not going to do it.</i>

491
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,747
<i>We, we don't want a man's
death on our hands.</i>

492
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,650
<i>Okay, listen, you don't want the
man's blood on your hands,</i>

493
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:33,687
<i>you don't want to give the order,
then, fine, I'll give.</i>

494
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:37,457
<i>Just grant me power of attorney,
and I'll give the order myself.</i>

495
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:38,459
<i>You would do that?</i>

496
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:41,228
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

497
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:42,230
<i>Let's do it.</i>

498
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:44,732
<i>Perfect.</i>

499
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:49,170
<i>I'm telling you, Frank,
Gosling has got to be the one</i>

500
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,339
<i>because he's the only one that
can handle my intensity.</i>

501
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,975
<i>God, you're obsessed
with Ryan Gosling.</i>

502
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:56,311
<i>Well, no, I just think... Charlie?</i>

503
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,349
<i>Mac, you know the best thing
about time travel movies?</i>

504
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,951
<i>They're full of surprises.</i>

505
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,519
<i>Oh.</i>

506
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:07,022
<i>Beautiful painting
you've got there.</i>

507
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:10,493
<i>Too bad it's the wrong one.</i>

508
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:11,494
<i>Huh?</i>

509
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,429
<i>That's not... this is
the painting.</i>

510
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:14,396
<i>You got the wrong painting.</i>

511
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,431
<i>I don't know,
they look exactly alike.</i>

512
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,934
<i>Silence, fools.</i>

513
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,603
<i>This has gone on long enough.</i>

514
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:26,074
<i>This painting clearly causes
madness in men.</i>

515
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,742
<i>And it must be destroyed.</i>

516
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,712
<i>Charlie, no, no destroying
that painting.</i>

517
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:31,846
<i>That's a piece of history.</i>

518
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,881
<i>That's the key to
Hitler's madness.</i>

519
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,715
<i>Oh, this?</i>

520
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:35,883
<i>Come on.</i>

521
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:37,385
<i>I painted this.</i>

522
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:38,386
<i>What?</i>

523
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:43,058
<i>I painted it and I loved it,
so I saw an opportunity to get</i>

524
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:47,896
<i>it back, but now I'm realizing that
this painting is making us</i>

525
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,899
<i>all crazy-- crazy.</i>

526
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:53,536
<i>Hitler's painting, the key to the
Holocaust, Ryan Gosling</i>

527
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:56,138
<i>playing you?</i>

528
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,674
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

529
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:02,545
<i>This has to end now, and so I
have the final solution.</i>

530
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:09,750
<i>I'm going to burn this painting
and you can't stop me.</i>

531
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:11,994
<i>We won't.</i>

532
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:12,995
<i>What?</i>

533
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:15,864
<i>Dude, if that's not an original Hitler,
then who gives a shit?</i>

534
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:16,865
<i>Yeah.</i>

535
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:19,334
<i>Oh, yeah, all right.</i>

536
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:23,104
<i>Did you like my whole,
my whole thing I was doing there?</i>

537
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,173
<i>Huh?</i>

538
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,544
<i>I need final verbal confirmation.</i>

539
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:31,445
<i>Yes, just do it already.</i>

540
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,281
<i>Wow, what an asshole, huh, Doctor?</i>

541
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,949
<i>You are killing a man.
You know that, right?</i>

542
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:36,751
<i>There's a lot of mercy
in this decision.</i>

543
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,585
<i>I commend it.</i>

544
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:39,287
<i>Oh, you commend-- well, you know,
I mean, technically we</i>

545
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:41,189
<i>gave the order to him to,
to give to you, so...</i>

546
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:42,957
<i>Yeah, if you feel like commending-
if you're in the</i>

547
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,793
<i>mood for commending, you could... Right,
if you're gonna throw</i>

548
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:49,163
<i>some commendations around, you know,
just... We'll take 'em.</i>

549
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,498
<i>Okay.</i>

550
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:00,642
<i>Wow.</i>

551
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,078
<i>Uh-oh, here we go.</i>

552
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,546
<i>What is that?</i>

553
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:07,116
<i>Uh, he seems to be breathing
on his own.</i>

554
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:08,517
<i>That happens sometimes.</i>

555
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:12,388
<i>Uh, how long until he's not
breathing on his own?</i>

556
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,221
<i>Until he perishes?</i>

557
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,189
<i>Right.</i>

558
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:16,191
<i>Could be months, weeks, days.</i>

559
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,192
<i>Who knows?</i>

560
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,727
<i>He's a fighter, this one.</i>

561
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,763
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

562
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:23,432
<i>Well, if you'll excuse me,
we've had an incredible amount</i>

563
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:29,505
<i>of stray dog attacks all over the city,
so our E.R. is slammed.</i>

564
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:30,506
<i>Hmm.</i>

565
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,741
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

566
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,642
<i>It's okay, let's go.</i>

567
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:35,511
<i>He had nothing of value
to leave us anyway.</i>

568
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:36,345
<i>Yeah, come on.</i>

569
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:39,681
<i>Well, actually he did.</i>

570
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,883
<i>Burn, baby, burn.</i>

571
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:44,292
<i>Dude, I'm still psyched
about this movie.</i>

572
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,312
<i>Okay, the ending needs a little bit
of work 'cause nobody cares</i>

573
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,780
<i>about an original Charlie Kelly.</i>

574
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,749
<i>Well, it's not an original,
you know.</i>

575
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:52,285
<i>I just painted over one of the old
paintings that he gave me,</i>

576
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:55,222
<i>so... Who?</i>

577
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,223
<i>Pop-Pop.</i>

578
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,712
<i>So Pop-Pop did give you
the painting?</i>

579
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,915
<i>Well, it was in the box of junk
that he gave me, but it's</i>

580
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:01,749
<i>just trash.</i>

581
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:02,750
<i>That's an even worse ending.</i>

582
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:03,584
<i>It's so complicated.</i>

583
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,587
<i>I can't even follow the
goddamn story.</i>

584
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,255
<i>I-I don't care. Dude, Gosling.</i>

585
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:08,575
<i>Gosling will not play you!</i>
