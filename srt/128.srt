1
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,026
<i>All right.</i>

2
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,593
Uh, let's get started.

3
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:40,996
What do you guys want to know?

4
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,483
<i>The circumstances
surrounding the death of</i>

5
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:07,584
<i>the woman born Maureen Ponderosa</i>

6
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,920
<i>captivated South Philadelphia.</i>

7
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:14,092
<i>She was discovered in an
alley with a broken neck.</i>

8
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,764
<i>In 2013, Maureen had begun</i>

9
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:21,795
<i>her transition to a cat.</i>

10
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,068
<i>And in her cat form,
she went by the name Bastet</i>

11
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,604
<i>to honor the Egyptian god of cats.</i>

12
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,762
<i>The story quickly became
fodder for local media.</i>

13
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,130
So much for having nine lives.

14
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,932
This cat did not land on her feet.

15
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,734
She landed on her neck.

16
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:38,936
<i>Authorities soon focused</i>

17
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:41,586
<i>on the suspicious nature of her death.</i>

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,255
<i>My name is Lance Girard.</i>

19
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,798
<i>I've been with the Philadelphia
Police Department for 24 years,</i>

20
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,801
<i>12 of which were with
the Homicide division.</i>

21
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,603
I've seen a lot of things.

22
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,972
A man wants to turn
himself into a woman?

23
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,540
Okay. Who am I to judge?

24
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,410
But, really, a cat?

25
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,745
What's next? A watermelon?

26
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,649
<i>First thing we wanted to establish is</i>

27
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,784
<i>to whether the deceased
was acting strange.</i>

28
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:10,787
Not like "I'm turning myself
into a cat" strange.

29
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:13,257
More like suicide strange.

30
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,793
<i>We learned that she was excited
about an upcoming surgery,</i>

31
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:18,795
<i>a, uh, reverse nipplectomy.</i>

32
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,464
<i>That's where they add more nipples.</i>

33
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,300
I guess...

34
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,270
I don't know... she wanted more nipples.

35
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:29,740
The thought of that just makes
me want to blow my lunch.

36
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:32,408
<i>Now, apparently,
the ex-husband was on the hook</i>

37
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:35,346
<i>for this surgery due to
an alimony arrangement.</i>

38
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,614
He wasn't happy about it.

39
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,949
That's when he became
our primary suspect.

40
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,652
<i>Was I irritated by this?</i>

41
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:44,087
Yeah, of course I was.

42
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,524
I mean, it was
the most expensive procedure yet.

43
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:48,691
You know, but I-I remained supportive

44
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:50,828
and, uh, kept my cool.

45
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,363
And I never threatened her in any way.

46
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,516
Now, due to the nature of this call,

47
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,819
we decided to bring
him in for questioning.

48
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,122
<i>And he cooperated.</i>

49
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:21,492
Said he wanted to clear his name.

50
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,872
<i>He answered every question.</i>

51
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,074
Even offered DNA samples.

52
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,710
Although he did request
to draw his own blood,

53
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,846
which is kind of strange.

54
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,766
Mr. Reynolds was forthright.

55
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,769
Charming, quite frankly.

56
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,040
<i>It wasn't until I reviewed</i>

57
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:13,276
<i>the interrogation footage
later that I saw it.</i>

58
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,214
Something very unsettling.

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,919
<i>24 years on the job,</i>

60
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,955
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

61
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,425
<i>Two hours.</i>

62
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,427
<i>Never moved.</i>

63
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:34,031
<i>Never blinked.</i>

64
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:37,268
Gives me goose bumps
just thinking about it.

65
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,902
<i>He had all the right answers,</i>

66
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,438
<i>but my gut told me this guy was guilty.</i>

67
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,008
Of something.

68
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,246
Did I kill Maureen? No.

69
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:52,850
Am I glad she's dead? Sure.

70
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:58,802
<i>Maureen's family was
convinced of Dennis's guilt.</i>

71
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,716
<i>Maureen?</i>

72
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,885
Maureen died three years ago.

73
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,886
Dennis killed Bastet, all right?

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,922
And let me tell you something.
He did us all a favor.

75
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:11,460
You ever seen a grown woman
take a dump in a sandbox?

76
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,663
<i>Despite conjecture,
the question still remained:</i>

77
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,466
<i>Was there anything
in Dennis Reynolds' past</i>

78
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,150
<i>that would suggest
him capable of murder?</i>

79
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,146
Testing. Testing.

80
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,840
Syphilis. Syphilis.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,318
That's... Well, yeah...

82
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,522
Well, he kind of...

83
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:33,526
snapped the neck, uh,
off a crow one time a little bit.

84
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,126
But that... but that's not

85
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,161
not <i>normal right, you know?</i>

86
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:39,164
<i>I mean, it was just like boys</i>

87
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:41,367
being boys. Yeah. That...

88
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,402
Look, we had a totally
normal childhood, and...

89
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:46,171
<i>Look, Dennis wouldn't hurt a fly.
No way.</i>

90
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:48,207
<i>Whatever Deandra says is BS.</i>

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,808
She's probably just covering for him

92
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,678
because she's afraid he's gonna
snap her neck like that crow.

93
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,213
<i>He didn't just snap it.</i>

94
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:55,847
<i>He broke the thing's head clean off.</i>

95
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,954
<i>It was gruesome.</i>

96
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,250
I still have nightmares about it.

97
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,418
And I'm old.

98
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:02,353
She told you what?

99
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:03,889
No, no, no, no. No, no.

100
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,524
Look... that crow was injured,

101
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:08,894
and I was simply putting
it out of its misery,

102
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:12,765
while, yes, testing the tensile
strength of a crow's neck.

103
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,868
Well, yes, there was another crow,

104
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,536
but that's because I
simply couldn't believe

105
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:19,438
that a crow's neck could be that weak.

106
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:22,407
Well, yes, there was a third crow,

107
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,510
and a fourth, if you must know,
but who likes crows?

108
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,212
<i>Look, if you can kill a crow,
you can kill a cat.</i>

109
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:31,750
<i>Cat, cat, cat...</i>

110
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:36,054
That's why I started recording
all our conversations.

111
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,803
I suspected Frank was probably recording

112
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:28,707
all of our conversations,
because of course he would.

113
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,042
But let me tell you something,

114
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,576
he was no fan of Maureen's, either.

115
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:33,378
He was just trying to deflect attention,

116
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,513
which is why I started recording

117
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,183
all of our conversations as well.

118
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,352
I could have worn a goddamn
IMAX camera around my neck

119
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:41,753
and he wouldn't have noticed.

120
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,554
The old bitch.

121
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,756
And I caught him saying
some pretty troubling stuff.

122
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,527
What are we watching here?

123
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,894
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats, cats.

124
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,328
Is that me?

125
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,231
Cats.
I'll tell you what to do with cats.

126
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,932
Who shot this thing? Dennis?

127
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,068
Here's what you do with cats.

128
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,005
Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam,
we found a cat,

129
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:01,773
we tossed it right in the soup.

130
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:05,243
Those hungry bastards
ate cat soup every day.

131
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,845
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

132
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:09,848
Some little kid choke
on a hairball and die.

133
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,750
So then you toss him in the soup.

134
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,519
I was making money
hand over foot, literally.

135
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:17,855
Somebody lost a hand or a foot,
I'd toss it in the soup.

136
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,126
Well, that's all a lie.

137
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,128
Uh, there was no soup.

138
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,299
Nope.

139
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,967
There's no sweatshop.

140
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:36,008
Excuse me. I got to go to the can.

141
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,676
<i>Investigators
wanted to verify the timeline</i>

142
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,592
<i>Dennis provided to authorities.</i>

143
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,413
<i>Like I told the police, uh,</i>

144
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,382
Mac and I were watching a
movie back at the apartment,

145
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,049
and then I went to the bar.

146
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,586
That's true. We were watching
<i>Operation Dumbo Drop.</i>

147
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,255
We were doing this amazing
thing that I came up with,

148
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,823
where we watch an old movie,

149
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:59,025
and then I turn the
volume down really low

150
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,528
and we make wiseacre
remarks the entire time.

151
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,997
Yeah, he didn't come up with it.

152
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,365
It's just <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000.</i>

153
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,566
- It's a spin on that.
- It's exactly that.

154
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,534
- Well, there's no robots.
- So it's worse.

155
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,236
Oh, come on, Dennis. It's funny.

156
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,005
It-It's not funny.
It's not funny at all,

157
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,874
because you can never
think of jokes on the fly.

158
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:15,408
H-He, like, pauses the movie

159
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,010
to try and think of
something funny to say,

160
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,578
and then he never can
think of anything funny,

161
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:22,215
so he ends up just saying a line
from <i>Borat</i> or <i>Austin Powers.</i>

162
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,518
It's super annoying and played-out,
and it's not funny.

163
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,086
Well, uh, like this. "Get in my belly."

164
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:30,090
But you're never referring
to anything when you say it.

165
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,092
"Yeah, baby. Get in my belly."

166
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,559
Well, that's two different characters.

167
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,628
- That's Mike Myers.
- It's not Mike Myers.

168
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,564
It's... it's multiple characters

169
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,266
that Mike Myers plays
in-in the same movie.

170
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,035
Multiple characters in the same movie?

171
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,137
What is he, a wizard?

172
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,539
Look, it's funny, Dennis.

173
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,041
It's not funny.

174
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,875
Are we done with this? Can we be done?

175
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:51,044
I'm tired of saying the same
things over and over again.

176
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:53,079
Well, wait. Wh... hold...
Dennis, d-don't leave without me.

177
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:55,416
I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?

178
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,650
<i>Investigators

179

180
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,654

181
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,722
<i>a twist.</i>

182
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:04,490
He totally could have done it.

183
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:07,961
Now, supposably,
Dennis didn't see Maureen that night,

184
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:11,631
but remember that Maureen
was once Dennis's...

185
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:15,468
"Wife. Very nice."

186
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,239
That was Borat.

190

192
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:36,456
<i>Deandra Reynolds refused to
be a part of this documentary</i>

<i>in the reenactment.</i>

195
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:42,929
<i>And Dennis always made a big show</i>

196
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,031
<i>of getting her with the spray bottle.</i>

197

<i>You know, because cats hate water.</i>

198
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:53,640
<i>So, you see,
Dennis totally saw Maureen that night.</i>

199
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,174
<i>Charlie was there.</i>

200
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,642
Why hasn't he spoken up?

201
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,545
Probably because Dennis...

202
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:00,847
intimidated him.

203
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:05,652
Oh, I just thought it'd
be more dramatic if I...

204
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,187
Oh, come on, come on. I didn't lie.

205
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,790
I just left out some facts
that are insignificant.

206
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:12,625
And-and intimidate Charlie?
Please. What am I gonna do?

207
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:15,062
Call him on the phone and threaten him?

208
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,233
No, I know.
But, I mean, if Mac's gonna do it,

209
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,113
then, you know, I'm gonna do it.

210
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,845
At this point in the interrogation,

211
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,148
Christ, I was at a loss.

212
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:24,813

Yep.

Well, answer me this:

00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,483
Where's the collar?

<i>Cats have collars.</i>

<i>This is not the first time

Hey. Stop!

239
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,529
Stop! Stop with the squirting!
Stop! Cool it!

240
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:01,098
We said one spray and then my line.

241
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,034
I... It was in my contract
that we talked...

242
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,536
I put one squirt in there for...
on purpose.

243
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,405
And this collar!
I... Th-There's something wrong

244
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,517
with the collar. It's driving me nuts.

245
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,678
It... is an actual flea collar?

246
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,333
You son of a bitch.

247
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:17,903
I-I really think the water activated

248
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,574
some kind of, like, chemical agent.
My-my neck's burning.

249
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,743
<i>Was the flea collar
actually burning her,</i>

250
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:24,978
<i>as she claimed?</i>

251
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,312
Are you serious?

252
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:28,481
Yes, asshole! It was burning my skin!

253
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:30,150
You want to zoom in on this?!

254
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,585
<i>Hard to say.</i>

255
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,754
<i>But maybe there was another
reason she removed it.</i>

256
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:36,690
<i>Whatever Deandra says is BS.</i>

257
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,924
She's probably just covering
for him because she's afraid

258
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,660
he's gonna snap her neck like that crow.

259
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:45,064
<i>Maybe Deandra
didn't want to wear the collar</i>

260
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,032
<i>in order to cover for her brother</i>

261
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:51,238
<i>and to establish that Maureen
never wore a collar at all.</i>

262
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,241
<i>We then discovered something
in this piece of footage</i>

263
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:59,345
<i>that blew the doors
wide open on this case.</i>

264
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,615
Was I a person of interest?

265
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:02,883
Yeah.

266
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,784
I am an interesting person.

267
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,886
But at the end of the day, you know,

268
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,089
I'm just some guy with a crazy ex-wife

269
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:12,459
who fell off of a roof
pretending to be a cat.

270
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,893
That's the end of it.

271
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,096
All my stories checked out.

272
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:19,099
I was cleared. Case closed.

273
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,837
<i>Find the collar, find the killer.</i>

274
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,539
<i>Find the collar, find the killer.</i>

275
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:27,908
<i>...'cause a dog is who I am now!</i>

276
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:28,909
<i>...hit the referee!</i>

277
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:30,277
<i>Find the collar...</i>

278
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,278
<i>"Very nice."</i>

279
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:34,948
<i>Find the collar, find the killer.</i>

280
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,128
Guys, this was an open-and-shut
case that was shut months ago.

281
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,897
And Maureen never wore a collar.
You guys put that there.

282
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,166
Well, yeah,
we needed a big twist at the end

283
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,668
to show that you're guilty.

284
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,001
But I'm-I'm not guilty.

285
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,838
What about the security
footage of Maureen's death?

286
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,237
I mean, it shows her
prancing around on the roof

287
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:02,370
like an asshole,
and then she just falls off.

288
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:04,339
People don't want to see that,
because it's hard evidence,

289
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,140
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

290
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,147
Like, it's better to
actually sit on that footage

291
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,181
until, like, maybe episode ten,
and then let people

292
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:10,950
decide then if you're guilty or not.

293
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,452
Ten episo...
You're gonna do ten episodes of this?

294
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,655
Yeah, but then even then
we would keep it vague.

295
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:17,324
I mean, 'cause that's entertainment,
you know?

296
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:19,258
Someone gets murdered,
and then you make a show.

297
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,826
But you never give any actual answers,

298
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,529
- because that's what people love.
- No.

299
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:25,365
You drag it out. You rake it
all over the victim's family.

300
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,133
It's sort of like eating
a bag of chips, you know?

301
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,969
It's never gonna actually make you full,

302
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:30,169
and at the end you're sick,

303
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,805
but you want to go back for more.

304
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,440
You want more chips.

305
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:34,874
- Murder is chips.
- Okay,

306
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:36,977
you know what, I don't know
what you guys are talking about,

307
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,644
but I'm gonna find these tapes,
and I'm gonna destroy them.

308
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:39,710
Well, we have backups, so it...

309
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:40,711
- Yeah.
- Oh, you know what?

310
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,849
That could make a good episode,
where he's destroying...

311
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:44,618
Let's think about that, right?
He's destroying the tapes...

312
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,119
You know what,

313
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,152
that would be

314
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:48,521
"very nice."

315
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,491
Is that Borat?

316
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:52,792
Yes! See?

317
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:54,894
