1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:04,297
- Just use 'em, dude.
- I'm not going to

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,789
wear gloves while I work!
I'm sorry, it makes no sense.

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:08,891
It absolutely makes
sense-- you're a janitor who

4
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,793
snakes toilets with his bare
hands.

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,728
So my hands get a little
dirty from time to time.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,664
I appreciate the concern, but
I'm fine.

7
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,566
It's not for you!
It's for us!

8
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,534
Use gloves!
Use gloves.

9
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,304
Oh, look at this.
Check it out.

10
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:24,140
The Restaurant and Bar
Association's Best Bar Award is

11
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,175
coming up.
We could get nominated.

12
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:28,111
Frank, we never get nominated
for awards, okay?

13
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,079
And we don't give a shit because
they're stupid.

14
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:31,981
Yeah, we don't care about
that kind of stuff, all right?

15
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,150
Look, am I curious as to why we
never get nominated?

16
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:36,185
Sure, yeah.
Do I care? Not in the slightest.

17
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,121
No, I don't care about it,
you know?

18
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:40,590
I mean, all right, it is a
little <i>odd</i> we've never been

19
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,525
nominated.
Yes, it's odd.

20
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,460
At some point it becomes a
little aggressive.

21
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,629
So what is it?
We don't deserve it?

22
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,731
We're not cool enough?
Whoa.

23
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,800
Whoa, okay, Frank.
Now, if... if I do something,

24
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,935
you better believe it's cool.
Yeah, if I'm gonna put my

25
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,904
name on something, it's gonna be
award-worthy, you know.

26
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,839
I can't imagine that other
people are doing what we're

27
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,741
doing better.
I mean, it's serving up drinks.

28
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,843
It's just upsetting.
I'm sorry, I'm getting upset.

29
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:03,746
If-if you want to get a
nomination, you got

30
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:05,681
to play the game.
Nah, I don't want to play a

31
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,617
game to get an award.
That feels lame.

32
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,052
- It <i>is</i> lame.
- Oh, is that your ass?

33
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,788
Oh, closer to the hole, sir?

34
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,458
You know what's lame?
Being around this long and never

35
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,029
getting an award. Makes you look
like a bunch of assholes. Hmm.

36
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,131
You're really, like, driving
this home, and it's upsetting,

37
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,966
because, like, now I'm getting
the neck thing.

38
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,601
I feel... I feel...
I'm getting upset.

39
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,537
Yeah, your neck's going nuts?
Yeah! You're getting that?

40
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,372
<i>They're</i> making me feel like
an asshole.

41
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:31,107
They <i>are</i> making us feel
like assholes.

42
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,742
All right, you know what,
we'll play the game,

43
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:34,477
I'll kiss ass.
Yeah, let's play the game.

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,379
I'm okay with it,
because who cares?

45
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,014
All right, fine,
let's play the game.

46
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,949
But I want to be very clear
about something.

47
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,846
This literally means
nothing to me.

48
00:01:53,089 --> 00:02:03,202

49
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,760
This office sucks.

50
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:09,419
It smells bad and
it's stuffy in here.

51
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,355
Yeah, it's the Restaurant and Bar
Association, it's a stuffy organization.

52
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,290
They're not in touch with
the young people like us.

53
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,826
Some old boner gives me attitude,
I'm gonna spit in his face.

54
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,795
He starts giving me
shit, I'll spit at him.

55
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:19,763
We should all spit.

56
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,364
Look, we're not
spitting, all right?

57
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,299
Just keep your mouth shut
and let me do the talking.

58
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,467
I know what I'm doing.

59
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,970
Sorry, sorry to
keep you waiting.

60
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,338
Frank Reynolds, Paddy's Pub.

61
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,906
These are my associates.

62
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,909
Stand up, show him some respect.
I stand for no one.

63
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,278
Please, it's not necessary.
Have a seat.

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,480
You heard the man-- sit down.
Well, now I feel

65
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:41,117
like standing.
But I don't want to stand

66
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,586
through an entire meeting 'cause
I don't know how long it's gonna

67
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,822
last, so I'll sit down.
It's <i>my</i> choice.

68
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:49,426
With much dignity and grace,
we've come to talk to you about

69
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:53,163
the Best Bar Award.
Now, in the past, our group has

70
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:59,369
not... <i>paid</i> you any attention,
but now we are prepared to

71
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:04,874
<i>pay...</i> you what you deserve...
in attention, if you get my

72
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,510
drift.
I don't.

73
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:10,680
Ponder lettuce and shrimp.
Excuse me?

74
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:12,715
He's inviting you out to
lunch, Bozo-- you gonna go or

75
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:14,651
not, yes or no?
Actually, it's 3:30 in the

76
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,619
afternoon-- I've already eaten.
This dickhead doesn't want a

77
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,555
second lun... He's being offered
lettuce and shrimp, he doesn't

78
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:20,190
want to eat lunch.
You eat once a day?

79
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,891
Hey,
everybody, I had food.

80
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,827
All right, you know what, I
am out of here.

81
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,728
I don't need this limpdick
telling me whether my bar's

82
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,730
cool, okay?
No, no, no! No spitting.

83
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:31,935
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

84
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:35,839
Look, how much is it gonna cost
us to get on the ballot?

85
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,841
Ten dollars.
Huh?

86
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,877
The entry fee is ten dollars.
All you have to do is fill out

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,912
the-the paperwork.
Why have we never received

88
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:45,315
this form?
Well, we've-we've actually

89
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:48,518
s-sent you the form many times
in the past, and as I recall, it

90
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,024
always comes back covered in fecal
matter, urine, and... racial slurs. Oh.

91
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,960
That's a joke.
Hey, you know, that's just,

92
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,095
like, all in good fun, man.
That's just our sense of

93
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:01,664
humor-- you'll get us.
Shut up!

94
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,133
Let bygones be bygones.
Right, right.

95
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:06,569
We're here now
to play the game.

96
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:11,508
Yes. Playing the game.
I assume you take cash.

97
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,043
Oh! So sorry.
That wasn't meant for you, that

98
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,012
was actually meant for you.
Yeah, that was meant for him.

99
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:17,647
We thought maybe you would
think that was funny.

100
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,616
Yeah, if it exploded in your
face, but I can tell by the look

101
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:21,317
on your face that you don't
think that's funny.

102
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,286
That's not your style.
That's a shame.

103
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,121
Yeah, that's sort of our
sense of humor.

104
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,023
Guys, he's not gonna get us.
I think we got to get out of

105
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,692
here, right?
All right, guy.

106
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:32,095
♪What'd I say, idiots?

107
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:34,197
You want to get nominated, you
gotta play the game.

108
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,299
We are playing the game, Frank.

109
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,167
Nah, you're not playing...
We're just not vibing with

110
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,903
that guy, he's a stiff.
We were vibrating, but maybe

111
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,471
at a different frequency than
that guy.

112
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,805
I like that.
Frank is right.

113
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,440
No, Frank is right, though.
We're too fringe.

114
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,242
I mean, yeah, it's given us a
lot of street cred, but I think

115
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,077
we've alienated a lot of people
in this town.

116
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,946
Yeah, you-you want to win
awards, you gotta campaign for

117
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:52,081
it.
It's an industry award.

118
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,250
It's true.
Like, we know we're cool and our

119
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,786
customers know we're cool, but
the industry doesn't get it yet.

120
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,721
All right, you know what?
Can you guys actually drop me

121
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:03,092
off back at the bar? I'm gonna go work
on the Best Song. What Best Song?

122
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,262
The Best Song Award.
There is no Best Song Award.

123
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,364
What are you talking about?
Well, that's all the more

124
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,600
reason to do a Best Song, right?
We'll be the only bar who did

125
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,669
it, and that's a good chance
we'll cover all the bases.

126
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,306
I tell you what: let's
drop him off either way. Okay.

127
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,807
That sounds good.
Good idea, Charlie.

128
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,343
Good idea, come on.
What?

129
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:32,889
I can't believe that this
place won Best Bar.

130
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,626
I mean, who comes to this place?
A shitload of people.

131
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,495
Sudz is a super-popular place.
I can't believe how bright it

132
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:40,930
is in here.
I don't like it.

133
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:44,167
Yeah. And what's with all the loud, fake colors?
I mean, where's the subtlety?

134
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,702
All right, let's go grab a
drink.

135
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:47,637
We'll suss out the competition.
I'm gonna go find a manager,

136
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,039
introduce myself, give him
this swag bag.

137
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,241
What's in that bag?
Ah, it's just this stuff I

138
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:54,777
had our names printed on.
I got a bottle opener, a

139
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,648
keychain, egg. Why would you give him an egg?
It's like a paperweight.

140
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,284
Trust me, Deandra, people eat
this shit up.

141
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,886
Look, you gotta play the game.
I know how to do it.

142
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,521
Right.
Good luck.

143
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:07,423
Let's get a drink.
Yep.

144
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:09,459
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

145
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,861
My name is Greg; I'll be your
bartender tonight.

146
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:14,397
You ever been to Sudz before?

147
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,865
You wish.
Don't think so, pal.

148
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,468
Okay, well, welcome, then.
For our first-timers, I like to

149
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,904
recommend our blended signature
cocktail, The Blue Hole.

150
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,806
It's served with three straws in
a fishbowl.

151
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,142
It's pretty darn good.
Some people say it's better than

152
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:29,278
an orgasm.
Not that he's ever had one.

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,447
Oh!

154
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,751
Okay, Maxwell, remind me to
find a new best friend.

155
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:37,353
Aw! Ee-aw!

156
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:42,358
Ugh. Two margaritas for table six, Greg.
Hey, Amanda, what's wrong?

157
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,763
Let me guess. Your boyfriend canceled on you again.
Conference got extended.

158
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,132
What can I say?
He loves his work.

159
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:52,435
Well, I think he should spend
a little less time on his work

160
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:57,840
and a little more time on you. Aw...
Thanks. You're so sweet. Hmm.

161
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:00,176
What in the hell is happening?

162
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,345
I don't know.
What are they doing?

163
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,480
Okay, sorry about that.
So, one Blue Hole?

164
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,416
Uh, well, let's see.
There's three of us, so, three

165
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,753
drinks. Yeah, well, they're generally
shared, 'cause they're pretty big.

166
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,855
Said three, dick bag.
Get three!

167
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,957
Uh-huh.
I don't care for that guy.

168
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,326
Me neither.
No.

169
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,262
Too soft. I want a little
edge in my bartender.

170
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,130
You know, this is Philadelphia.
What's with the, uh...?

171
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:22,932
What's with the black friend
that no one is acknowledging?

172
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,801
Is black...?
I feel like it's weird if you

173
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,669
don't talk about that, you know?
It's strange to have one

174
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:28,304
black friend and not be
constantly talking about it.

175
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:30,139
Yeah, shine a light on it,
make sure everybody sees and

176
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,041
knows, like, "I have a black
friend," and that's a thing.

177
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,910
'Cause it's weird that a
black person is friends with

178
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,712
white people.
Hmm. I don't... think it is.

179
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,647
It's not that weird, but it's
that... but it's a thing.

180
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,649
It is, it is.
Here you guys go.

181
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:42,018
Oh.
There we go.

182
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,254
Oh, drink up!

183
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,623
What the hell was that?

184
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,926
That's a Sudz alert.
When we ring that bell,

185
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,261
everybody's got to drink, right?
Yeah.

186
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,630
I don't need a bell telling

187
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,833
me when to drink.
I'll drink when I'm goddamn good

188
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,901
and thirsty.
I'm pretty sure I know when

189
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:03,206
to take a drink. Screw their stupid bell, you know?
I wish I had drank when

190
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,174
everybody else drank, though,
'cause it seemed like fun.

191
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:07,110
Well, now I feel left out.
Can we drink now?

192
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,078
Let's drink now.
Together?

193
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,214
'Cause I-I...
Now I'm angry.

194
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:16,219
Mmm.
Mmm.

195
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,488
What are you doing in my
office?

196
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,823
Oh.

197
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:23,226
You snuck up on me.
Frank Reynolds, owner of Paddy's

198
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:26,162
Pub.
I just thought I'd come by and

199
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:30,900
say hello, pay my respects.
Also, I got you a little goody

200
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:33,836
bag here.
Some trinkets, knickknacks that

201
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:37,340
you might enjoy.
There's a broken egg in here.

202
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,642
Oh, shit.
That wasn't the hardboiled one.

203
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,978
Hey, you want me to cook that up
for you?

204
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,214
Ah.
Mmm.

205
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,550
Oh, man.
Ooh! Goddamn.

206
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:49,852
That went down easy.
I like this.

207
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:54,557
Yeah. Guys, I'm starting to like this place.
It's growing on me, too.

208
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,893
I-I like the chemistry that the
staff has.

209
00:08:56,895 --> 00:09:01,130
Oh, did you guys see that charged
moment between Greg and Amanda? Yes.

210
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,099
Boy, I tell you.
She's got a boyfriend, but I

211
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:05,001
think that she and Greg should
end up together. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

212
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,969
I'd like to come back next
week to see if they do.

213
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:11,007
Yeah. Me, too. You know? I mean, she is
cute, she is just super cute, right?

214
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,242
She's so cute.
She's cute. She is very cute.

215
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:15,044
She's not funny, though, so...
Yeah, but, no, but she

216
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,979
doesn't need to be funny because
she's cute, she's loveable,

217
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,781
everybody likes her, and then,
if she can tell a joke, yeah,

218
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,917
hey, it's just a bonus, you
know?

219
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,752
Let's get out of this dump.
Oh, actually, this place is

220
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,654
not a dump, Frank.
It's pretty great.

221
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,455
Hey, hey, Greg, can you get this
man a Blue Hole?

222
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:28,357
You got to try this thing.
I got news for you.

223
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,526
Our secret's out, and it stinks.
This manager's been to Paddy's,

224
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,495
and he said it's nothing but a
bunch of people yelling over

225
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:36,799
each other. Well... So what? That's what we do.
We yell at each other, and if

226
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,768
people want to tune in and
listen, then they're welcome to.

227
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,903
Yeah, but I think that's
off-putting to the customer.

228
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:43,005
I mean, Greg would never yell at
Amanda.

229
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:45,174
All right, I'll tell you what
we got to do.

230
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:47,109
We got to up our game.
We should host an industry

231
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,278
night.
Invite all the people who vote

232
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,747
who's in the industry to come to
our bar, and we'll show 'em what

233
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:53,916
we're made of.
Yeah, but I'd like to tweak a

234
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,118
little bit of who we are and
what we're made of, right?

235
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,389
Yeah. Soften the edges a little bit.
All right, we'll tweak it a

236
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,491
little bit, we'll show these
bastards who's award-worthy.

237
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,827
Yeah.
Yeah!

238
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,430
Oh-ho! Drink! Drink!

239
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,441
Okay, guys, if we're gonna
show these industry folks

240
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,496
tonight that we're likeable, we
need to have some funny banter

241
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:15,665
like Greg and Maxwell have.
Yeah. Don't worry.

242
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,767
I'm gonna be zinging one-liners
all night long.

243
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,635
Uh, actually, Dee, you won't
be zinging anything around,

244
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,571
because men are intimidated by
funny women, all right?

245
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,706
So, what we need you to be is
just pretty and benign.

246
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,042
But we are gonna do a will-they-
or-won't-they thing between you

247
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:30,112
and Mac. Dee and I don't
want to be together. No.

248
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,814
But the customers want you to
be together.

249
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,683
That's fun for them.
Why would it be fun for them

250
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:35,518
to watch two people not want to
be together?

251
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,753
Well, no. You <i>do</i> want to be
together, okay?

252
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,389
The customers have to think that
you think that you don't want to

253
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,091
be together, but you do, deep
down, want to be together.

254
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:44,060
The problem is, right now, I'm
getting that you guys don't want

255
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:47,830
to be together. I need you
to want to be together. Ugh.

256
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:49,999
Question.
Yes, you're wondering how

257
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:51,901
we're gonna make Dee attractive
enough to where you'll want to

258
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,070
be with her.
Yes.

259
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,005
Okay, see, what I'm gonna do
is, I'm gonna shellac her with

260
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,773
makeup, and I'm gonna blast her
with light to soften up all

261
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,742
those features.
I am into that, yes.

262
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,812
Yes. Okay, great.
So, guys, I got us banter cards.

263
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,780
Mac, you're gonna welcome the
customer in, and then I'm gonna

264
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:07,650
execute with a quip.
Let's give it a shot.

265
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,752
"Hey, I'm Mac.
Welcome to Paddy's Pub.

266
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,654
I would like to recommend to
first-timers our signature

267
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:13,823
blended drink, Caribbean
Paradise.

268
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:15,958
People say it's better than an
orgasm."

269
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,894
Not that he's ever had one.
I've had orgasms!

270
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,029
I've had tons of orgasms!
I've had one with your mom,

271
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:24,267
dude! I will strangle you, I'll stick
my goddamn thumb through your eye!

272
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, dude, relax, relax.

273
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:28,337
Sit down. What are you doing?
Okay.

274
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,506
You came at me, and I gave it
back to you hard, 'cause...

275
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,642
Uh, yeah, I'm getting that.
Look, I'm just doing the thing.

276
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:34,777
Oh.
See, what you just did--

277
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,146
that's how we normally talk.
That's very aggressive.

278
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:39,448
I came at you hard.
You came at me real hard, and

279
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,550
people aren't comfortable with
that sort of behavior.

280
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,686
That's why we're trying
something different here, okay?

281
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,821
Guys, memorize these lines,
okay?

282
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:47,990
We need to seem like it's coming
off the cuff.

283
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:50,092
Right. Plus, she didn't even
feel a thing.

284
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:52,194
What?
What?

285
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,996
That's the punch line to Mac
bang-banging our mom.

286
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,932
She didn't, she didn't even
notice.

287
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:58,234
Oh, Dee, Jesus Christ, your
timing is so bad.

288
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:00,569
He just said it.
There's a timing concern.

289
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,905
Look, stop.
Don't do the jokes, okay?

290
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:05,241
Let's settle into our new roles
here, okay?

291
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,610
Little bit of role-play.
Change of plans.

292
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:09,712
Change of plans.
We got to go darker with

293
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:12,048
Industry Night, edgier.
No, Frank, don't derail us.

294
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,383
We're doing bright lights,
bright colors, and funny banter.

295
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,686
That's what wins.
Wrong.

296
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:19,021
Artemis and I went to a
burlesque bar last night.

297
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,357
Eh, there were women
stripping, but it was classy.

298
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,493
It was dimly lit.
They were serving martinis,

299
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:27,096
period costumes.
There weren't a lot of people in

300
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:29,398
there, but this bar has won a
shitload of awards.

301
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,234
Do you guys think that our
location is the problem?

302
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,203
Hmm.
That could be it, yeah.

303
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,972
Well, no, see, there was that
bar that just opened last year

304
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:39,608
right down the street, and they've
already won a ton of awards. Oh, mm-hmm.

305
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,944
Oh, right.
Is it us?

306
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:44,280
Ugh.
No way.

307
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,415
Us?
No, no, no, it can't be us.

308
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,351
No way.
I highly doubt it's us.

309
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,286
It's everybody else.
It's their problem, not us.

Charlie, that was great.

00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,242
It was really great.
You really knocked it out of the

do that song.

Doesn't make any sense.
No.

340
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:37,893
It's ridiculous. All right,
let's put on a good show.

341
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,967
All right, people are
starting to arrive.

342
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:51,864
This is great.
Okay, so when a customer comes

343
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,632
up to you, remember, keep it
light.

344
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,601
Light.
Keep it playful.

345
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,369
Playful.
Right?

346
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:59,271
Y'all ain't got to worry
about me.

'Cause I'm gonna be chatting
these fools up like a mug.

348
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,443
Cool.
Okay, thanks, Z.

349
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,378
Yeah, I'm a little worried
about him.

350
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,314
We should have gotten a less
intense black guy for diversity,

351
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,282
but we don't have any in our
roster.

352
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,218
But maybe we could find another
one, throw him into the mix?

353
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,153
You know, to counter Z's vibe?
You got to be really careful

354
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,121
about the ratio.
We get too many black guys,

355
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,057
people think it's a black bar.
That will not help us.

356
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,992
Black bars don't win awards.
No.

357
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:21,961
I don't know why, but they
don't.

358
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,896
Loving these lights, you guys.

359

I am glowing like an angel
over here.

360
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,634
Oh, my God.
Hi, can I get a drink?

361
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,203
Hey, I'm Mac.
Welcome to Paddy's Pub.

362
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:34,006
I like to recommend to our first
timers our signature cocktail--

363
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:39,378
Caribbean Paradise. Some people say it's
better than busting a nut. Excuse me?

364
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,914
Busting a nut.
It's like, uh, you know, blowing

365
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,983
your load.
He said it was a funny joke.

366
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,151
Well, no... hold on.
Yeah, it's like coming all

367
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,220
over you.
It's light, it's playful.

368
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:50,356
Yeah, well, no, I think what
my friend is trying to refer to

369
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,925
is an orgasm, which is light and
playful, but he overstepped

370
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,893
himself and got a little bit
too specific.

371
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:56,996
Sorry, we jizz in the drink
and that's what makes it light.

372
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,098
No, no, nobody's jizzing on
anything.

373
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,833
Well, where do I jizz?
You don't jizz.

374
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,635
How can, how can I orgasm if
I don't jizz?

375
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:04,470
No, ma'am, I think what...
Just tell me where I jizz so

376
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:06,338
I can give this lady her drink.
Ma'am, what would you like to

377
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,841
drink?
And we won't jizz on anything.

378
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,776
Not like Mac's ever had an
orgasm.

379
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:12,745
Holy shit, you're late.
She was late.

380
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:14,680
Go back in your light.
We're all set up back there.

381
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,615
Deandra, grab a couple of
bottles of champagne, let's go.

382
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,550
Yup.
N-N-No, I got it, I got it.

383
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:20,519
Dee, stay in your light.
Come with me, come here.

384
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,454
All right, listen, listen,
listen.

385
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:26,659
What was that? All right, look, look, look, look.
You two do the charged moment.

386
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:30,195
Will they or won't they?
Mm-hmm.

387
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,870
What's wrong, Dee?
Oh, nothing.

388
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,805
Let me guess-- boyfriend
troubles?

389
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:44,176
Hmm. This guy doesn't know what he's got.
He's really ugly, too.

390
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:46,178
I'm sorry, are you talking to
me?

391
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,113
Yeah.
I said her boyfriend's ugly.

392
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:50,049
Pay attention, bozo.
Okay, he's not ugly, all

393
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,984
right?
That wouldn't make any sense.

394
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:54,053
That's-that... He's not ugly.
Dude's a total tool, too.

395
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,988
It's...
You know what he's not?

396
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,923
He's not covered in stupid
tattoos and he doesn't have a

397
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,725
cigarette for a mother...
What?!

398
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,660
Don't talk shit about my mom!
Whoa.

399

Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Stop-- what the hell's going on
over here?

401
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,499
That man is choking that woman.

402
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,335
Get over here.
What are, what are you doing?

403
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:12,104
This isn't will they or won't
they?

404
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:14,273
This is I know they won't and I
know I don't want them to.

405
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,875
Excuse me, there's a guy

406

Oh, uh, that-that's okay.

407

Uh, don't worry about it,

What are you doing, dude?

409
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,818

410

You put, you put me in the
basement with spray cans.

411
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:30,322
I got high.
Do me a favor, go back in the

412
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:32,324
basement, okay?
Get higher if you want.

413
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:34,460
Just go back in.
Don't sit down there.

414

No, no, no, no, no, don't,
don't... Goddamn it.

00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,900
What up?
Oh!

00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,203
That's too many black guys,
dude-- the ratio's off.

418

Hey, guys, guy... gentlemen,

How about something a little bit

Here, come with me.

Yeah, this is classy.

Oh, my God. I did.

bottle out!
