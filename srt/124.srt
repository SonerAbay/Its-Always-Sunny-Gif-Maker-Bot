1
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,493
Ooh. Man, that was, like,
one Mississippi that time.

2
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,733
Yeah, that storm's, like,
right on top of us, huh?

3
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:16,134
Yeah. It's kind of cool, though.

4
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:17,997
I mean, I can't think of a better
way to have a movie night

5
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:19,599
than in the middle of
an electrical storm.

6
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:20,733
- It's kind of cozy, right?
- Mm-hmm. Cool, right?

7
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:22,148
Why do we have to watch<i> The Wiz?</i>

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,900
This movie sucks.

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,558
Well, it's Old Black Man's
night to pick the movie.

10
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:27,764
Yeah, but he's asleep.
Yeah, but, like...

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,882
why do a remake of<i> The Wizard
of Oz?</i> I mean, the original

12
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:31,718
was a classic. Uh, don't you
think it's fair, though,

13
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:33,136
that they get their version? You know,

14
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,520
I mean, it's very difficult

15
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,556
being a black person
in America, you know?

16
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,225
So what? Doesn't mean I
want to watch Orlando Bloom

17
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:40,803
in<i> Boyz n the Hood.</i>

18
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:42,195
Yeah, I don't want to see that.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,479
Oh, yeah, if you flip it it's weird,
man, yeah. I would see that.

20
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:44,781
I would see that. I would see that.

21
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,065
I mean, look, this may be

22
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,233
a little bit touchy for me to say,

23
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:48,818
but, uh, you know, black people...

24
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:50,703
They have a lot more
opportunities these days.

25
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,989
Well, we did have a black president
before the orange one.

26
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:54,759
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
there's not problems.

27
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,743
I mean, what about the whole,
like, Black Lives Matter thing?

28
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,298
Uh, well, sure, no, good point.

29
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,213
But, I mean, I don't know why
it took 'em so long to realize

30
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:01,581
that their lives matter.

31
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,079
I mean, they-they've always mattered,

32
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,219
you know? But I would also say
that all lives matter, you know?

33
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,087
And while black people
may not feel like it,

34
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,090
it's kind of tough out there
right now for everybody.

35
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,260
I mean, really, our lives
aren't all that different.

36
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:30,276
Whoa. Oh...

37
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:32,528
What the hell happened?
Did we get struck by lightning?

38
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,197
Uh, I think it came through
the electric blankets.

39
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:36,199
Yeah, we got electrocuted. Holy shit.

40
00:01:36,284 --> 00:01:38,785
Look at this... the VCR's toast.

41
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,536
Uh, wait a sec...

42
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:42,038
Where's Old Black Man?

43
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:43,673
Oh, my God. He's gone.

44
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:45,958
What the hell? What?

45
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,293
Uh...

46
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,711
guys?

47
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:50,463
You're gonna want to see this.

48
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:51,798

49
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,812

00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:39,301
This is insane.

we got, we got to, like,

pinch ourselves or something?

Okay, guys, I think I know
what's happening here.

98

we have access to the

- I don't know that one.

My pockets are empty.
Oh! Maybe the lesson

154
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:52,621
we're supposed to learn is
that black people are broke.

155

<i>You're</i> broke.

156

00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,126
This kid's got 25 bucks.

158
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:58,994
Oh! Black people are rich.

159
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,244
- That's the lesson.
- You know what, no, I think we're not

160
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,165
supposed to make wild
assumptions about black people

161
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,939
based upon whether or not
we have stuff in our pockets.

162
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,700
Yeah, that's... that's just...
Don't make that assumption.

163
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,776
But I'll tell you what, you know what
the first thing I need to do is?

164
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,801
Find Reggie Williams.

165
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:09,963
Uh, no, actually, that's
the second thing.

166
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,623
I got to cancel my credit card, 'cause
this Reggie guy might have it, you know?

167
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:14,752
Oh, right, that's the
lesson we have to learn:

168
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,011
that black people
will ruin your credit.

169
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:17,056
No... What?

170
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,642
Dude, you... you have to stop.
And you have to stop. I mean...

171
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,131
What are you talk... I'm just trying
to figure out what the lesson is.

172
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,900
We're never gonna zap
back making these kind of...

173
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,832
Well, hold on a second... the
thing I was saying was that I

174
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:25,681
would cancel my credit card no
matter what race the guy was.

175
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,648
- But you went right to it...
- All right, you know what,

176
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:29,009
okay, fine, let's just find the guy.

177
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,558
Look, how are we gonna get in
your car without your keys?

178
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:32,510
Oh, I can get in, man. I've
lost my keys before. You just

179
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,512
got to kind of rock the car a
little bit. Wiggle it down?

180
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,264
And check the back door,
actually, 'cause sometimes...

181
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:37,648
- sometimes that's unlocked.
- Back door.

182
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,067
- Like a wire hanger or...
- Usually if I push it

183
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:41,485
- a little bit, though...
- A coat hangar somewhere.

184
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,581
Just kind of slide the window down...

185
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,551
Car 559, responding
to robbery in progress.

186
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:51,279
Shit. Okay, look, it's all right,
all right, calm down, calm down.

187
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:52,663
It's all good, it's all good.

188
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,332
You know, we can talk
our way out of this.

189
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,950
We get out of this stuff all the time.

190

♪ Well, I think we just
found out a new rule. ♪

191

This is the exact same place
where I found Old Black Man...

192
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:15,426
- What. God, God, Frank.
- Oh, sorry, sorry. Old Man...

193
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,805
- Okay.
- In the first place.

194
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,138
You know what? This has
got to be our mission.

195
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,816
I just feel it. We're
just gonna find Old Man.

196
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:21,231
- We're gonna find him a place to live.
- Yeah, yeah.

197
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,011
Like, we'll stick him in a
nursing home or something.

198
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,050
You can afford that, right?

199
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,399
- Right, right. And then...
- Yeah.

200
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,651
When we turn white again,
I'll stop paying the checks.

201

Oh, stop! Don't-don't say that out loud.

202
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:32,179
Just... I feel like whoever zapped
us here is probably listening.

203
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:33,870
Who's that? Who zapped us?

204
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,518
I don't know, Ziggy? They don't...

205
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:37,219
They never really clarified
on<i> Quantum Leap.</i>

206
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:38,302
They just, they just accepted it.

What? You mean nobody ever
went after the guy for revenge?

bigger problems on our hands.

00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,367
- What if we have priors?
- I do have priors.

312
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,555
Oh, I have priors, too.

313
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,654
I-I didn't mean us, I meant them.

Dude. That could be...

315
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,484
He probably does have
priors. You prob...

316
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,375

00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,541
for all the work your parish has done

342
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:28,842
with the police athletic league.

343
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:30,260
We're church blacks!

344
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,096
Church people.

345
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,798
Yeah. Church... we're
just church people.

346
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:36,099
The fact that we're black is irrelevant.

347
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:37,384
Has nothing to...

348
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:42,389
Will you look at this place, Old Man?

349
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:45,359
You will not have to be living
with that Dee person anymore.

350
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:47,644
So it's kind of a win-win for
everybody in this situation.

351
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,196
- Carl.
- Ruth.

352
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:50,948
Where have you been?

353
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,065
Looking for you.

354
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,318
Children, did you find him?

355
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,236
Yes. Yes... children?

356
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,487
We're their kids!

357
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:58,739
- Holy shit!
- Oh, shit.

358
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,957
- We reunited them.
- We did.

359
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,458
- That was our mission.
- We did it!

360
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:03,216
- Oh!
- Oh, God, yes.

361
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,540
Hey. What's all the hubbub
about over there?

362
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:06,106
Oh, shit.

363
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:07,750
Oh, what?

364
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,867
That's Scott Bakula from<i> Quantum Leap.</i>

365
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:10,917
I thought you said

366
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,171
Blacula, like a black vampire.

367
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,554
Hey. So we were right?

368
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,764
Wait a minute, are you
here helping somebody?

369
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,976
- Are you leaping?
- Oh, my God.

370
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,709
The show... I can't get away from it.

371
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:24,564
Look, that was just a TV
character. I'm an actor.

372
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,483
- Why do you got a mop?
- Researching a role.

373
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,060
So...

374
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:31,058
You didn't get a piece of the show?

375
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,606
Your residuals ran out. I'm sorry.

376
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:35,142
I've been working constantly
for 30 years, okay?

377
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,110
All right. Okay, yeah.

378
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:39,029
So... Well, anyway, we just

379
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:40,497
reunited a family, and
we're gonna, Yeah.

380
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:41,865
We're gonna leap. We're gonna leap now.

381
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,560
Yeah, right now.

382

- Tell us how to do it.

385
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,041
Okay, just get out, okay? Hmm?

386
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,459
- Get out. Everybody, everybody get out.
- Wait.

you with respect.
