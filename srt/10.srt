00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:05,270
[ mac ]
aw, come on! This isn't fair.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,941
You accidentally burn down
a building, and you get
120 hours of community service?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,443
Now this says that
I gotta work with kids.
Yeah, me too.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,680
I don't like kids.
I don't wanna work with 'em.
I don't have time for this.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:20,019
Yeah, I have
248 hours of, uh--
interstate.

6
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,521
Inter-- interstate.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,591
Sanitation. Jesus christ!
What is that--
what is that?

8
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,560
That's the guys with the orange
vests who pick up trash.
Orange vests.

9
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,898
Oh, my god! And then
what is this about the a.A.?
Alcoholics anonymous.

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,401
- for--
- oh, my god.

11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,970
Six months!
That is so unfair!

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,606
What do you expect?
Why would you
tell the judge you were drunk?

13
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,608
'cause I was drunk.
But why would you say that?

14
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,411
I thought that
would get me off the hook.
That was dumb, wasn't it?

15
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,414
I would rather pay a huge fine
than have to give back
to the community.

16
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,116
Holy shit!
Look at this bill!
What?

17
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,187
Those mimosas were like
eight bucks a pop, charlie.
Are you serious?

18
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,424
Well, you had
like seven of 'em.
Uh-oh.

19
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,592
Bro, I'm not paying
for your mimosas.
No way!

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,196
I didn't even bring
enough money for those.
I don't have enough money.

21
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,566
You don't have any money?
What are you--
are you serious?

22
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,535
Ah! Ah!

23
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,303
[ chattering ]

24
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,306
[ frank ]
good. Good. Good.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

25
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,142
¶ [ asian ]

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,445
[ chattering continues ]

27
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,447
I know what it is.

28
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,484
We can't go back.

29
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,121
[ chattering continues ]

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,560
I fold. Deal me out. Hey.
Hey, gang, what's the action?

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,332
- what's going on here?
- asians love gambling.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,567
- you know these guys?
- yeah. From 'nam.

33
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,936
You were in vietnam?
Don't get excited, mac,
all right?

34
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,305
He was in vietnam 10 years ago
on a business trip.

35
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,308
- beautiful country.
- dad, please get these guys
out of here.

36
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,344
They're really weird
and scary looking.
Yeah.

37
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,212
Hey, I own
half this bar too.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,149
You can't just come in here
and start running our lives.
It's not fair.

39
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,384
Wanna bet?
What?

40
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,953
- would you like to bet on it?
- on what?

41
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,623
- whether or not it's fair?
- sure. Bet on whatever.

42
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,959
You know what? This is exactly
why I don't wanna work with him.
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,862
Yes.
Because you start doing crazy
shit like this all the time...

44
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,765
And making crazy bets about
absolutely nothing at all, dad.

45
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,636
If you don't go, me and mac
and charlie, we're gonna sell
our portion of the bar.

46
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,638
No, we're not.
No, that's
not happening.

47
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,307
Just back me up on this.
No, I can't really
back you up.

48
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,177
- why can't you just
back me up on this?
- [ shouts in vietnamese ]

49
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,779
- you guys--
- [ shouts ]

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,350
[ shouts in vietnamese ]

51
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,620
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

52
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,856
That just blew my mind.
That was incredible.

53
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,495
So today's speaker is david,

54
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,231
For those of you
who are new to the program.

55
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,234
I know a number of you
have heard david's story before.

56
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,603
But a few of you haven't.
I'm sure you'll find
david's story...

57
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,872
Has a lot of relevance
to your situation.

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,209
Uh, anyway,
I'm gonna go ahead and--

59
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,444
We have a late arrival here.
[ laughs ]

60
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,547
<i>Hi. Do you want</i>
<i>to introduce yourself?</i>

61
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,716
Me?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

62
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,152
Oh. I'm charlie.

63
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,154
[ all ]
hi, charlie.

64
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,124
- here. Have a seat down front.
- oh. No. Okay.

65
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,293
I knew this would happen.
I'm not an alcoholic actually.

66
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,963
Yeah, I'm only here
'cause I got a little drunk,

67
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,700
And I threw a flaming bag
of feces into a building and
I burnt it down a little bit.

68
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,770
You know? But I wasn't
trying to burn it down.

69
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,707
I was trying to make
the place smell real bad
and get rid of this guy.

70
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,743
So-- this guy knows
what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,346
Look, uh, charlie,
the first step to recovery...

72
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,648
Is simply admitting
that you have a problem.

73
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,750
I'm not an alcoholic,
so it's cool.

74
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,353
He was drinking a beer
when he came in.

75
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,122
Oh, my-- dude! Oh, dude,
how are you gonna--

76
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,758
Really?
[ scoffs ]

77
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,227
I thought you were cool,
man, like--

78
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,263
[ mac ]
I'm not gonna sell
my piece of the bar.

79
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,432
You're being
such a dick about this.

80
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,600
What do you want me to do,
get another job?

81
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,504
Well, try to think where
I'm coming from in all this.
I'm coming from a selfish place?

82
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,606
<i>Just shut your mouth.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

83
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,277
We are here as part
of our community service.

84
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,014
- always a bunch of clowns.
- excuse me?

85
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:46,318
All right.
We need volunteers for our
Sunday basketball league.

86
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,787
You're gonna be coaching
the teams.

87
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,791
I got two positions left,
so I'm gonna have to put
two of you together.

88
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,494
Great. Dennis and I
will coach a team.

89
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,932
I think I'd rather
split you two up.

90
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:05,004
[ chattering ]

91
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,840
Charlie. Hi.

92
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,311
Hey. Wow. I didn't know
you were in a.A.

93
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah.
Where were you sitting?

94
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:20,119
I, um, kind of slumped down
in my seat when I heard your
name so you wouldn't see me.

95
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,454
Right.

96
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,323
Listen. I didn't realize
you were an alcoholic.

97
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,659
It actually explains
a lot of your past behavior.

98
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,661
Check this out.
I'm not an alcoholic.

99
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,131
See, I have to be here
'cause the court--
okay.

100
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,600
I threw this flaming
bag of feces--
okay, okay, okay.

101
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,369
You don't have to give me
explanations. I understand.

102
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,738
I've maybe been
a little too judgmental of you.

103
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,575
I mean, I know what it
feels like to have alcohol
run your life.

104
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:47,479
Doesn't run my life.
And I--
I want to maybe help you.

105
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,617
Are you saying you want
to go out on a date with me?

106
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,752
No. No, charlie.
No?

107
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,455
I don't-- I never want
to go out on a date with you.

108
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,358
Great.
What I'm saying is...

109
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,428
Maybe I could...
Be your sponsor.

110
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,731
Oh!
But you can't ever hit on me.

111
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,100
No.
Because that's
never gonna happen.

112
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,202
Yeah, I heard.
You said that.
Okay.

113
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,404
So, sponsor.
That's cool, yeah.
Okay. Okay.

114
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,074
Well, I wrote down
my phone number.
Wow.

115
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,811
Please. Please, charlie.
Please don't make me regret
giving this to you.

116
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,213
No, absolute--
absolutely not.

117
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:25,517
No, this'll be a platonic
sponsor-sponsoree
kind of a thing.

118
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,653
Great.

119
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,657
Oh. No shit!
I was so close.

120
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,364
All right, kids, kids.
Uh, why don't you line up on
this free throw line over here.

121
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,804
All righty. Uh, you,

122
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,842
<i>You, you, you and you,</i>

123
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,844
Come over here.

124
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,151
All right. Now the rest
of you kids can go with those
two losers right there.

125
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell's goin' on
over here?

126
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,824
Pickin' my team.
No. No, y-you can't--
you can't take all--

127
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,793
- I can't pick the--
- you can't pick all--

128
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,129
- what should I not pick?
- you know exactly
what you've done, sir.

129
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,931
- okay, everybody back.
- whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's my team!

130
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,401
No, we're startin' over.
All right. Fine.
But I pick first.

131
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,369
Fine.
You.

132
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,405
You.
Uh, you.

133
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,207
You.
You.

134
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,511
Hey! Ho!
What's goin' on over here?

135
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,280
Pickin' teams.
The teams are already picked.

136
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,450
You two have the ducks,
and you have the wildcats.

137
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,620
[ laughs ]
ducks.

138
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:38,724
Are you kidding me? Are--
you guys are the wildcats?

139
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,326
Jesus chri--

140
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,629
Is anyone absent?

141
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:47,466
Anyone tall?
What are those, flip-flops?

142
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,639
Jesus, kid.
Did you not wear shoes?

143
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:57,109
You don't know?
Did anyone else not bring shoes?

144
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,480
All right, kids.
Everybody take a knee.

145
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,882
Go ahead and kneel.

146
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,152
Apparently there is
some confusion as to who
is the head coach here.

147
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,588
Yeah, it could be a guy
who's never participated...

148
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,623
In any kind of sporting
event ever.

149
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,126
Yeah, or it could be a girl.
That's enough said, right?

150
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,528
<i>Mac and I are gonna play</i>
<i>a quick game to 21.</i>

151
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,731
And the winner
will be head coach.

152
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,733
You guys might
want to pay attention,

153
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,235
'cause you could
probably learn a thing
or two from watching us.

154
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,038
Absolutely.
Try to remember
what she does wrong.

155
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,073
That's the first thing.

156
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,512
Terrible.
Take a lap.

157
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,084
God awful.
Get goin'.

158
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:45,891
Oh, that's a great shot, chris.
Come here. You're gonna be
the saving grace of this team.

159
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,727
Everybody try to be
a little bit more like chris.

160
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,933
What the hell is that?
I don't know.

161
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,670
It's diet.
Oh.

162
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,673
Do I look like I need
to be on a diet?

163
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,042
I don't know.

164
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,278
Terrible.
Take a lap.

165
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,021
This one?
Gonna get it this time?
[ grunts ]

166
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,159
See, kids, that's 18-0.
[ groaning ]

167
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,695
Fundamentals don't mean shit
if you got no strength.

168
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,731
- my knee hurts.
- we're almost done.

169
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,234
[ groaning ]
oh, god. You son of a bitch.

170
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,646
So this is your place?
Wow!

171
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,549
You know, it actually looks
a lot like my apartment.

172
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,684
Don't sit on my bed.
No. No. Wasn't gonna.

173
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,221
That's a good bed though.
That's a beautiful bed.
Nice and soft.

174
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,525
Charlie, are you here
to try to have sex with me?

175
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,931
I can't believe you could
ask me a question like that
in my time of need.

176
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,799
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,236
That's okay. We--
we got a history,
and you're suspicious.

178
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,740
I get that.
We got a crazy history,
you and me. Oh, well.

179
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,477
You know, maybe I'll just--
maybe I'll just get
a little comfortable,

180
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,313
And I won't talk,
and you can just kinda--

181
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,516
- <i>just watch your feet on the--</i>
<i>-</i> <i>tell me about--</i>

182
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,786
- I'll take my shoes off.
- no. Just don't take
your shoes off.

183
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,622
I'm really more comfortable
if I take my shoes off.

184
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,691
Charlie.
So tell me about you.

185
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,495
What kind of music are you into?
What's your favorite color?

186
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,598
You ever-- you ever owned a dog?
Do you want a dog?

187
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,202
This thing is cozy.

188
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,438
Just ice it
and it will go down.

189
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,241
I know what you do to it!
Hey, what's the action?

190
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,377
Oh, jesus christ!
Are you gonna keep saying that?
Is that your catch phrase now?

191
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,547
- dad, can you please
get me some ice?
- what happened to your eye?

192
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,450
Well, mac plays basketball
with his elbows.
That's what happened.

193
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,951
Youse were
all playin' basketball?

194
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,287
Yeah. It's a part
of our community service.

195
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,924
Gotta coach kids.
It's part of our, uh, sentence.

196
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,393
Like two teams playin'
against each other?

197
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,529
Yeah, that's generally
how basketball is played.

198
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,132
Basketball, huh? Here.

199
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,469
And go! Very nice.

200
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,572
Lot of tight footwork.
That's it. Very good.

201
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,275
Chris, doin' really good.
You got some good moves.

202
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,410
Dad, what the hell
are you doing here?

203
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,447
Oh, well, I just came
because you were late.
I volunteered.

204
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,283
Hey, do some ball work.
Why are you
doing this to me?

205
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,053
I figured maybe you and I
could do a little father-son
bonding.

206
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:32,324
I don't wanna bond with you.
Go back to bonding with charlie.
Charlie's with a girl.

207
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,293
What girl?
You know, the waitress girl.

208
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,328
The waitress
hates charlie.
How do you know that?

209
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,098
Because he's obsessed with her
and won't leave her alone.

210
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:43,202
Quite frankly, I don't see
what all the fuss is about.
I banged her. I don't get it.

211
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,604
Dennis, you shouldn't
be sleeping with your friends'
girlfriends.

212
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,907
What, are you handing down
life lessons? Get the hell
outta here! Get off my court!

213
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,909
What? Your court?
Yeah.

214
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,978
Wanna shoot for it?
Free throws?
Shoot for what?

215
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,814
Throw me the ball.
All right.

216
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,984
Well, best out of three
gets to be the coach.

217
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,021
Dad, you don't wanna shoot me
for it, because you'll lose.
You wanna bet?

218
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,556
Okay, kids, keys to the game.

219
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,626
Elbows. Knees.
Say it with me once. Ready?

220
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,595
[ together ]
elbows. Knees.

221
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,332
Excellent. Excellent work.
Now you're gonna want
to utilize both of those...

222
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,334
Over the course
of the season, okay?

223
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,736
Because the referees in this
league aren't gonna call 'em.

224
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,240
But they might, which is why
you have to be very careful.

225
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,643
Fouls can lose a game for even
the most dominant of teams.

226
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:28,847
Yeah, kids, could you excuse
the <i>assistant</i> coach and I
for a second?

227
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,883
We'll be back.

228
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,120
Don't you <i>ever</i> contradict me
in front of my team like that.

229
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,289
These kids need to know
who their coach is.

230
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,192
Well, I can see how
they might be confused.
Are those combat boots?

231
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,229
Don't get all high-and-mighty
because you got a pantsuit.
You look like big bird!

232
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,299
- <i>[ whistle blows ]</i>
<i>- I got the season schedule</i>
<i>right here.</i>

233
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,668
Get back!
I can handle this.
I have to see.

234
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,405
- what's up?
- why are you here?

235
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,708
I'm coaching dennis's team.
Not coaching my team.

236
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,277
You lost fair and square.
Don't give a shit.

237
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,546
Oh, it is on!
We play you guys first!

238
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,315
We are gonna school
your sorry-ass team!
Wanna make it interesting?

239
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,451
Dad, you don't wanna do that.
Our kids are terrible.

240
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,387
- that's what
a bad coach would say.
- a hundred bucks says we win.

241
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,724
You're on. I'm gonna coach
the shit out of this team.
Well, assistant coach.

242
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,026
- let's make it 200.
- how about five, bitch?

243
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,729
What are you doing?
You scared? You wanna quit?
You can back out.

244
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,798
'cause I can coach
this team better than you
or dennis or dad...

245
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,001
Or any other goddamn man
any day of the week.

246
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,204
Whoo! Whoo!
That's it! Gambling!

247
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,341
<i>[ grunting ]</i>

248
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,711
Oh, I can't tell you
how great I'm feeling.

249
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,381
I haven't been this healthy
in, like, a crazy long time.

250
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,483
It's having amazing effects
on my body.

251
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,353
That's probably
the best thing about it.
<i>Yeah. Wow.</i>

252
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,690
So you can probably
stop coming over here
all the time then, huh?

253
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:48,627
Uh, well, I don't know.
I just don't know
if that's safe.

254
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,031
- yeah, I think it's safe.
- maybe if you think it's safe,
I'll consider it.

255
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,234
But whoo--

256
00:13:55,301 --> 00:14:00,172
Hey, um, how's
your friend dennis?

257
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,141
Hmm?
I haven't seen him
around much lately.

258
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,276
What--
what's he up to?

259
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,479
He's, like, working at some
stupid youth center thing.

260
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:11,183
- he works with kids?
- yeah. But he has to.
That's why.

261
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,953
<i>Oh, my god.</i>
<i>That is so sweet.</i>

262
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,423
Do you think maybe we
could go down and see him?

263
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,591
Why don't we roll
down there today?

264
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,661
You know, you and me.
Celebrate the three days sober.

265
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,763
Great.
I'll get changed.

266
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,533
Great.

267
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,435
So get out.

268
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,504
Actually I probably
need to take a shower, 'cause
I'm crazy sweaty from those.

269
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,106
Charlie.

270
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,542
I'm an alcoholic
trying to get better,

271
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,644
And I'm getting
kicked out on the street.

272
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,680
All right. Jesus.
You can start.

273
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,782
<i>[ mac ]</i>
<i>these are wristbands,</i>

274
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,352
And these are safety pins.

275
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,422
I want everybody
to insert their safety pin
into their wristband...

276
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,458
Sharp side out.

277
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,662
All right, if you come down
right on the top part and
smash down with all your weight,

278
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,131
You'll break the kid's foot
in three places.

279
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,600
What if I get hurt?

280
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,603
That's a good question.
Now as long as you hurt
the other kid...

281
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,239
As bad or worse
than he hurts you,

282

You'll have done your job,
and I'll be proud of you.

the best player on the team.

291
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,176
All right? Now I wanna
give you a couple lessons...

292
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,546
That maybe coach dennis
hasn't covered with you.

293
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,350
Lesson number one:
winnin' ain't everything.

294
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:56,221
Lesson two:
do you own a bike?

295
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,025
Hey.

296
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,361
Dennis, hey.
Hey.

297
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,797
[ laughs ]
I haven't seen you in a while.

298
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,199
You haven't come by
the coffee shop.

299
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:11,470
Uh, yeah.

300
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:16,809
Um, so I know
that it was kind of--
it got weird after the--

301
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,545
Right.
When we--

302
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,947
Um, anyway,

303
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,918
I thought maybe we could spend
some time together again.

304
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,489
Um, haven't you
been spending a lot of time
with charlie lately?

305
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,524
I'm helping him
get sober.

306
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,994
Right. Well, good.
That's a good thing.

307
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,996
Thank you.
Yeah.

308
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,499
So I don't want to get
in the middle of that.
Oh.

309
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:44,470
So we shouldn't talk at all
while that's going on.

310
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,272
Oh.

311
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,475
Good. All right.
I'll see you.

312
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,443
Wha-- you will see me.

313
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,980
I'll see you.
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

314
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,450
Charlie,
this isn't working out.
Huh?

315
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,321
I don't wanna be your sponsor
anymore. It's starting to get
in the way of my personal life.

316
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,592
[ scoffs ]
what are you talkin' about?

317
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,261
I only offered
to be your sponsor...

318
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,031
So I could get closer
to your friend dennis.

319
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,968
What? Dennis?
Yeah.

320
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,938
Come on! That guy, he's
like one of those cheesy--

321
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,342
Oh, he's so phony.
No. You know what?
We can't do this action.

322
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,679
You gotta-- 'cause what
if I start drinking again?

323
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,281
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

324
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,053
I hope you guys
are ready for the pain.

325
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,522
Oh, we'll be bringing
a little pain of our own.

326
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,525
You guys are goin' down.
We'll see.

327
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,161
All right, kids,
how are you feelin'?
[ together ] good.

328
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,097
Good? Doesn't sound good.
Are you drinking the red bull?

329
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,399
Come on.
Chug 'em down.
I feel sick.

330
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,869
That's the vitamins ripping out
the inside of your stomach.
That's a good thing. Trust me.

331
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,639
Flop, come here
for a second.

332
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,478
All right.
These are for you.

333
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:03,148
And there's
a steel toe in there.
Don't be afraid to use it.

334
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,351
Thanks, dad.
I'm not your dad.

- you don't know? You guys
know where chris is?

339
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,699
[ together ] no.
Ah, it's no big deal.
We don't need him.

340
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,969
It is a big deal.
We can't play without chris.
I got 500 bucks on this game.

341
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,971
Are you crazy?
[ stammering ]
well, let's--

342

We can't play without him.
No. You can't go.

343
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,510
He lives a block away.
I'll be right back.
Dennis, where--

344
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,480
I'll be right back.
Let's go. Get ready.
Put your shoes on.

345
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,785
Hey, chris, you in there?
Chris, come on, buddy. Let's go.

What the hell are you doing?
The game's about to start.

348
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,694
I got a new bike.
So ride your bike
after the game.

349
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:52,364
I'm not supposed to play.
What do you mean,
you're not supposed to play?

350

You know what? I don't
have to talk to you, shithead!

I just wanted to say
good luck.
All right. Great. Thanks.

Um, why don't you have
a seat on the bleachers? I'm
in the middle of something.
