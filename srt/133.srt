1
00:00:01,355 --> 00:00:03,516
<i>So Dennis hasn't
even seen the apartment yet?</i>

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,955
<i>No. No. Yeah, Dennis lost a bet,
and I got to redesign</i>

3
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:09,227
our old apartment. He is gonna flip!

4
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:10,685
- Ooh. Nice. - Ah.
- That's great. I'm just

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:12,276
excited to have my old
place back to myself.

6
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,092
And guys, after the grand opening,

7
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,330
we finally get a chance to fire...

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,601
...the rocket launcher.

9
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,450
- Ooh. - Yes!
- Nice, dude! You got a rocket!

10
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:21,910
It finally came in the mail,
and now we have

11
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:23,912
- the perfect opportunity to celebrate with it.
- Oh.

12
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:25,169
- Yeah, that will be good.
- Fire in the hole.

13
00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:27,035
Guys, guys, guys, listen, listen.
There's a girl.

14
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,982
She's coming, okay?
There's a girl... Mandy.

15
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:30,960
Okay, she's here to stay, all right?

16
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:33,069
And-and-and you guys have
to take my lead because

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,528
I'm-I'm another guy, so don't address me

18
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,767
- as me because I'm somebody else.
- Are we us?

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,062
Well, yeah, of course you are.

20
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:40,271
I don't want to be me.
Can I be someone else?

21
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:42,352
No. You have to be you, okay?
All of you are yourselves,

22
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,552
- except for Dee.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,986
- Are you right-handed, or left-handed?
- That won't come up.

24
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,426
- Well, it could come up.
- It won't!

25
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:49,627
Okay. I'm gonna go with left then.

26
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:50,528
- I'll go with left.
- Cool. Left.

27
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:51,980
Let's go with the hand that I am,
for Christ's sakes.

28
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,609
Hey! Mandy. Hi.

29
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:56,425
Hey. Ooh.

30
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,566
Why'd you run up
ahead of me there, Brian?

31
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,286
Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad.

32
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:01,746
Oh.

33
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,692
So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?

34
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,703
Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.

35
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:06,839
Oh, so that

36
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,557
- must make you Prudence then.
- Yes.

37
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:11,218
- Uh-huh. Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

38
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:12,272
- Oh.
- He is Prudence,

39
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,473
- and I'm Griffin.
- No, he's Mac!

40
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,181
He's just Mac, so don't... Yeah.

41
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:17,478
And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.

42
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,938
And he's left-handed.

43
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,625
- Yeah.
- Oh.

44
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,965
I suppose I didn't know that about you.

45
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,162
Yeah. No, well, there was

46
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:25,563
- really no reason for it to come up.
- Mama.

47
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,243
Uh, guys, this is, uh,

48
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:28,634
- Mandy.
- Hi.

49
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,455
And this is, uh...
this is little Brian Junior.

50
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,784
Oh.

51
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,674
Yeah. He's my son.

52
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,266
Well, I'm gonna go with left-handed.

53
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,970
- Left-handed or right-handed, man?
- What's going on here, dude?

54
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,141
All right, look, you guys remember
when we did that Boggs thing.

55
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,924
We flew out to California?
Well, if you recall,

56
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,983
I actually got off in North Dakota.

57
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:09,806
Right? Being out of town,
I thought, naturally,

58
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,563
I'm gonna have a little bit of fun,
you know, so,

59
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,514
I picked up Mandy
there at an Applebee's.

60
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:15,303
- Oh.
- I was pretending to be

61
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,742
an airline pilot who flies out
of Philly named Brian LeFevre.

62
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,044
I went to an old character.

63
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:20,834
I needed a complete back
story for the manipulation.

64
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:23,761
- Of course, of course.
- Yeah, but wasn't Prudence Brian's wife?

65
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,616
Yes, but in this scenario,
she's my sister.

66
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,794
See, I'm always tweaking
things based on the situation.

67
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,616
And needless to say,
it worked like a charm.

68
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,405
But, uh, five months later,

69
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,520
she calls me up,
tells me she's pregnant.

70
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:34,539
- Oh!
- Mm.

71
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,773
Christ, what am I gonna do here?
And need I remind you,

72
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:38,888
once she finds out that
I'm not who I said I was,

73
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,196
and that I don't have any money,

74
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:41,979
- she could come after the bar.
- Ah.

75
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,443
- She could be entitled to that?
- Ah... shit. - All right, guys,

76
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:45,068
guys, everybody
just calm down, all right?

77
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,508
Maybe it's not about money for her.
Look, as we all know,

78
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,479
everything is about emotion with women.

79
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:50,468
- Right, Dee?
- What?!

80
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,255
- Whoa. - Whoa.
- Oh, my God. Whoa!

81
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,364
- All right, Dee, relax.
- Oh, whoa.

82
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:54,342
- Rrr.
- We're trying to have

83
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,807
a rational conversation, okay?

84
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,755
- Yeah, we're trying to help our friend here.
- Look, I think the point is,

85
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,545
maybe we got to close the emotion door

86
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:02,311
for Mandy by telling
her that you're gay.

87
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:04,295
Yeah, right,
but I already had sex with her.

88
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,628
How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?

89
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,503
Just go with me here.

90
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:09,304
Brian's not above having a
one-night stand with a woman,

91
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:11,289
but he's got no room for her emotionally

92
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,185
- because he's in love with me.
- With you?

93
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,526
- Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.
- Mm.

94
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:17,599
- Next plan.
- That plan

95
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,800
stinks, because it's always
about money with women.

96
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:21,731
That's all there is to it.

97
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,358
So I think the best thing to do is

98
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,243
to find a guy who's got
more money than you,

99
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,586
like in that movie,
uh, <i>Indecent Proposal.</i>

100
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,318
You get a millionaire to
bang her for a million bucks.

101
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:32,303
She takes the money and runs.

102
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:34,515
Would you sleep with her
for a million dollars?

103
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,583
No way. It's too much money.

104
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:37,767
All right, next plan. Dee.

105
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,946
Yeah, no, I've got a great plan,

106
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,737
but, uh, I'm thinking that this
isn't my problem, and, also,

107
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,298
you guys wouldn't listen to
me no matter what I said.

108
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,307
Good point. Charlie, plan.

109
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:45,589
I got it. If I just get

110
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:47,756
the waitress pregnant,
she's gonna be tied to me for life,

111
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,154
so, I got to do that.

112
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,030
He's already on to another thing.

113
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,760
All right, Christ, uh,
I got to do something here.

114
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,489
- Fine. Mac, we'll go with your plan.
- Yeah!

115
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,474
- Yes! Yes.
- Mm.

116
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,861
- Is the apartment ready?
- Yes. You are not

117
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:59,663
gonna believe what I did to it.

118
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:03,825
Surprise!

119
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:06,909
Huh. It looks, uh...

120
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,947
Exactly the same.

121
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,949
I was able to track down
versions of our old furniture,

122
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:12,282
and even found replicas

123
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:14,040
of all the knickknacks
that burned in the fire.

124
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,642
- It's bizarre.
- Bizarre in a good way.

125
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,953
- No.
- You don't like it?

126
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,579
No.

127
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,018
Hey, so, I don't mean
to interrupt here, fellas,

128
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,482
but I'm a little bit confused.

129
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,433
You never told me you had a roommate.

130
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:27,866
It's time, Brian.

131
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:29,720
Here's where things get
a little bit tricky.

132
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,744
Um... there's really
no easy way to say this,

133
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:35,673
but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.

134
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,298
- He's actually my, uh...
- Lover.

135
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,089
- Partner.
- Yes, well, we do make love.

136
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,366
- We don't actually make love...
- He's the power bottom.

137
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,642
- Now he generates a tremendous amount of power...
- Yeah. No, I...

138
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,627
- ...from the bottom.
- I don't. I don't, actually.

139
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,875
- Don't sell yourself short. He does.
- No, no. It's not that I...

140
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,645
It's just that we don't have sex.

141
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:50,832
Yeah, I, uh... I sleep with women,

142
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:53,401
but I'm emotionally involved with Mac,

143
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,866
which is why...

144
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:56,687
and this is the hard part... I...

145
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,258
I don't really...
I don't have room emotionally

146
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,371
in my life for you.

147
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:05,276
Okay. Uh... Wow.

148
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:06,933
Well, I'm a little bit shocked here.

149
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:07,749
Sure.

150
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,057
- Mm.
- But I guess the most important thing is

151
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,790
for Brian, Jr. to have
a relationship with his father.

152
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:16,011
And you know, Mac,
you seem like a real stand-up fella,

153
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,449
so, if you boys are open to it,

154
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,077
the only thing I can think of better

155
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:23,524
than Junior having one dad is,
well, him having two.

156
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,281
Ee.

157
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:26,746
- Yeah. No.
- Wow. I wasn't expecting that.

158
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:28,861
We're the type of guys that, um...

159
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,332
Who would love this.

160
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,306
Oh!

161
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:38,929
Yeah. Coming.

162
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,548
Hey, come on in.

163
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,085
All right, Charlie, you got 15 minutes,

164
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:46,134
and it's a dollar a minute
starting... now.

165
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:47,890
Oh, no.

166
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,168
No, no, no, no.
No, we're not doing this. Uh-uh.

167
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,152
Uh, now hear me out. It's not about sex.

168
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,916
- Okay, good.
- It's about having a baby.

169
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,007
- And I'm gone.
- Uh, no, no, no, hang on.

170
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,505
Hang on, one...
Just one second. Come on.

171
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,786
Look, I know you've always
wanted a baby, right?

172
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:02,691
I see you.
You poke around the preschools

173
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:05,522
and the playgrounds, and you got
that longing look in your eye.

174
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:06,443
Oh, God, that's so creepy.

175
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:07,986
Well, look, I can tell you this.

176
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,173
It...

177
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,963
It's not gonna happen for you.

178
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:13,058
Excuse me?

179
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,059
Yeah, you ain't gonna have
a baby. Check this out.

180
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:18,209
Your life has been on a slow,
but steady decline for years.

181
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:19,889
You were a coffee shop waitress, right?

182
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,884
On-again, off-again
troubles with alcohol.

183
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,707
Living in a women's shelter.

184
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:27,643
And finally,
all women's Achilles' heel... time.

185
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,700
Okay. Are you done?

186
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,945
- Because I feel like there's more.
- No.

187
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,548
- I'm seeing, like, a whole...
- Yeah, this is... I'm getting to the good part.

188
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,620
Look. Frank will provide for us.

189
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,020
- Right? He's got tons of money.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:41,728
You're never gonna have to work
another day in your life. See? Zzz.

191
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,713
All the way to sitting on
the beach in Rio de Janeiro.

192
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,144
Driving the lane to fame.

193
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,095
Okay, so...

194
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:51,357
the point is this,
life with Charlie and a baby...

195
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:54,055
...looking pretty good.

196
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,530
Did you really think
that this was gonna work?

197
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:57,589
- Did you really think that...
- Well...

198
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,620
...you would just have me in
here and you could just...

199
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,115
hurl insults at me.

200
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,035
- Huh?
- I've tried everything for years with you.

201
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,337
And I just... at this point,

202
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,345
I just don't know what else to say.

203
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:06,948
Oh, my God!
Stop saying things to me.

204
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:07,932
Don't you understand that

205
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:09,573
this is never gonna happen,
so let it go.

206
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:12,192
Look, w-why? You won't ever tell me why.

207
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,713
You just say no,
and you won't give me a shot.

208
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:15,500
I don't understand what's
so terrible about me.

209
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,998
What's so great about me, Charlie?

210
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:17,912
What's wrong with you?

211
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,305
Why are you so obsessed with me?

212
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,043
I mean, you said it yourself,
I'm a mess.

213
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:24,179
So, why don't you just
go find somebody better?

214
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,214
Well...

215
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,196
'cause there is no one better.

216
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:30,036
And...

217
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,238
I love you.

218
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:38,928
Yes.

219
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:40,719
Those jerks are finally gone.

220
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,857
Time to stretch out around here.

221
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:43,316
Heyo.

222
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,438
What's the haps, Dee?

223
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,577
What are you doing, Frank?

224
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,530
Oh, Charlie's doing a thing
at the apartment tonight,

225
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,668
so I'm gonna crash here.

226
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,711
- Okay?
- No, get a hotel.

227
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:52,435
You know what,
do you mind if I take the bed?

228
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,551
Because I got a little
pinched nerve in my neck.

229
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,323
- It's driving me crazy.
- Wh... yeah, I mind.

230
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm gonna go take a steam bath,

231
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,499
so why don't you whip me
up a bowl of that popcorn.

232
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:00,576
That smells so good.

233
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:01,767
- No. I'm not gonna do that.
- Thanks.

234
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:03,343
No, no, no, no, no, no. Frank! Stop!

235
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:05,545
Don't get all emotional, just do it.

236
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,146
I don't want this.

237
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,332
Okay.

238
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,454
They're asleep.

239
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,888
Dude, why did you say you
wanted to raise the kid?

240
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,192
I just got caught up in the moment,
you know?

241
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,330
It was so exciting.

242
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:21,469
Maybe we should do it.

243
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,748
W-we? We are not a couple, Mac.

244
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,244
Well, no, we would just keep pretending.

245
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:27,198
I am not gonna pretend
to be in a relationship

246
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,956
with you for the entirety
of my child's life.

247
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:30,647
Are you insane?

248
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,437
Lo... okay, you know what?
I can't handle this right now.

249
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,576
I'm gonna go sleep in your room.

250
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,717
You can sleep on the couch.

251
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,019
Oh, no... w-w-wait, Dennis.

252
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,255
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

253
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,078
Uh, hold on one second... I-I...

254
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:44,577
What is this?

255
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,694
This is the gym.

256
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,777
Uh-huh.

257
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:50,631
And where were you going to sleep?

258
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:54,571
Well, I figured since we got so used
to sleeping in the same bed at Dee's,

259
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,708
that we could just sort of

260
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,662
- continue that here.
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:58,801
You want to sleep on the couch...

262
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,908
...together.

263
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:03,943
I'm gonna sleep next to the dildo bike.

264
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:07,263
The Ass-pounder, uh, 4000,
is an exercise... bike.

265
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:14,748
That was, um...

266
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:17,678
That was not as bad as I expected.

267
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:18,752
It was amazing.

268
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:19,891
It kind of was.

269
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,030
It kind of was amazing.

270
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,072
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

271
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,480
Oh. Hmm.

272
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,302
What is this? What are you doing there?

273
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:27,442
- This? Oh, this just
- Yeah.

274
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,524
improves the chances of conception.

275
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:31,934
Of what?

276
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,236
Of getting pregnant.

277
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,701
Oh. Right.

278
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:35,839
Uh, the baby.

279
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:38,118
Right.

280
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,720
Hey, you know, speaking of which, um,

281
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:44,171
I think we're gonna need
to make some changes around here.

282
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,868
Oh. Like what?

283
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:51,169
Um, well, I think you need to repaint,
for starters.

284
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,284
Wh-why would I do that?

285
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:56,343
Charlie, this...
this paint could be full of lead.

286
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,297
Are you serious?

287
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,087
I can't carry a baby around lead paint.

288
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,877
Or... or, oh, I'm sorry.

289
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,592
Did you expect me to live
in the women's shelter

290
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:04,986
while I'm carrying your child?

291
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,922
Oh, no, um...

292
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,224
I hadn't thought about it,
but you can stay here.

293
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,362
- I mean, that's fine.
- Okay.

294
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,516
Oh, wow. Oh, thank you so much.

295
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,128
When this baby comes out, though,

296
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,822
Frank's gonna need to find
us a nicer place to live.

297
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,472
Oh, but I love this place.

298
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:16,740
Okay, well, I don't, and it's no place

299
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,044
to raise a child,
so end of conversation.

300
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,019
Whoa.

301
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,322
Hey. Hang on.

302
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,786
You're kind of coming
on strong right now.

303
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,089
- Are you serious right now?
- Well, look...

304
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,715
I'm carrying your child.

305
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,854
- N-n-n-n-n-n-no.
- Carrying my...

306
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,481
I am not finished talking.

307
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:28,947
Who's idea was this in the first place?

308
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,737
Look, I'm just saying
if you want to be a mom,

309
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:32,200
you're gonna have to learn
how to control your emotions.

310
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,512
I need to control my emotions?

311
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,432
Or I'm not gonna be a good mother?

312
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:38,418
Oh, my God!

313
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:50,753
Dee!

314
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,045
- I'm in trouble here.
- What? What are you doing here?

315
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:55,147
The waitress is totally, like,
moving into my apartment.

316
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:56,360
I-I-I can't take it.

317
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,913
I'm gonna need to hide
out here for a few days.

318
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,410
No. No. Hard no. Get out.

319
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,517
It's like, I didn't think
about the whole, like,

320
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:01,851
having a baby thing, you know?

321
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:03,284
It's like one thing to
trap a person with a baby,

322
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,260
but then when you actually have a baby,

323
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:05,399
then you become trapped.

324
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,733
What baby thing?
What are you talking about?

325
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,719
And plus, it's totally turning her
into, like, a different person.

326
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,281
She's, like,
acting like a real bitch now.

327
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:11,649
- She's always been a bitch.
- Now who's being a bitch, Dee?

328
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,884
Come on, I need help here, all right?

329
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,024
Look, I-I got to sleep, okay?

330
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:15,228
I can't think straight.

331
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,442
- I... ah, Christ... is he snoring?
- Yeah.

332
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,395
Snoring's the worst.
I'm gonna need to crash

333
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,347
- next to you, all right? You know what?
- What?

334
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,276
Don't be a whore tonight, Dee,
and try and bang me again, okay?

335
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,132
Because I got nothing left.

336
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:27,924
I'm spent; I'm really exhausted.

337
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,461
Too much sex and too much... stuff.

338
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,032
Just don't be a whore, okay?

339
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:39,652
- Dee! Egg!
- Where is it?

340
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:40,953
Where is it? There's no eggs here.

341
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,962
- Where are your eggs?
- Dee, where are your eggs?

342
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:43,716
Dee, eggs!

343
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:44,798
- Dee, we're looking for your eggs.
- Where are your eggs?

344
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,489
- We can't find them!
- Come on, leave me alone.

345
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,391
Just let me sleep;
I barely slept last night.

346
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,571
Dee. Deandra.

347
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:50,643
Look, don't be so emotional.

348
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:51,618
You're being very emotional.

349
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,918
Get up and get us an egg.

350
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,250
I'm getting like calls up
the wazoo from the waitress.

351
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,796
She's asking for, like,
groceries and shit.

352
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,484
- I mean, who does that?
- No.

353
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,767
Who-who just barges
into someone's apartment

354
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,807
- and takes over?
- Nobody.

355
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,787
Oh, my God, are you serious?

356
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,505
That's exactly what you guys are doing!

357
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,486
Uh, Dee, eggs, okay? I'm freaking out.

358
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,755
What is happening here?

359
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:07,119
I just got rid of two
annoying roommates.

360
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,517
This is not supposed to be happening.

361
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:09,978
God! She's calling me again!

362
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:11,279
It's like she's totally stalking me.

363
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,370
Dee, what do I do here?

364
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:14,560
You have been stalking
that woman for 15 years.

365
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:15,861
Now she's finally showing
you some attention,

366
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:16,965
and you don't like it?

367
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,265
Oh, Dee, you know what? Eggs.

368
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:19,271
I didn't ask for your opinion.

369
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,214
Yes, you did!

370
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,002
Hey, oh, good, Dee.

371
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,821
I need you to watch Brian Jr.
for a few hours.

372
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:25,446
- N-n-n-n-n-no.
- Y-y-y-y-yeah.

373
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,583
Frank, what the hell
are you doing here, man?

374
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,688
You're supposed to be
finding my millionaire.

375
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,158
I'm on it. I'm here trying
to get her to make us breakfast.

376
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,620
- Yeah, we haven't got any eggs.
- I need an egg.

377
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,058
Dee, why have you not
made this man his egg?

378
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,194
Do you want to take care
of this child for the rest

379
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:36,624
of your life, is that what you want?

380
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,762
Or do you want me to get out
of this situation that I'm in?

381
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,127
I'm gonna smash it!

382
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,874
Oh, Dee, don't get emotional.

383
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,286
Christ, if you're upset,
smash an egg into a pan for Frank.

384
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,106
Solve problems, don't cause them.

385
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:53,846
Oh, gee whiz,
look how fancy this place is.

386
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,285
We don't have anything like
this back in North Dakota.

387
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,584
Oh, yeah? Fascinating.

388
00:12:57,616 --> 00:13:00,670
Um, so, Mandy, um,
we have brought you here,

389
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:02,165
uh, to meet a gentleman.

390
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,790
- Um, I just feel really
- Oh.

391
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:06,196
badly now being able to
provide emotionally for you,

392
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:07,851
so I thought we could
set you up with somebody

393
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:09,315
who can provide for you both emotionally

394
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,744
and financially.

395
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:13,539
Um, so we are here
to meet a millionaire.

396
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,457
Oh, geez.

397
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:16,658
I don't know.

398
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,894
Yeah. No, I know.

399
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,193
It's, a, it's a little str... Oh, oh...

400
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:20,656
- Hey.
- Let's do this.

401
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:21,477
Oh.

402
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,393
Uh, Frank, where's the, uh, millionaire?

403
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,343
I am the millionaire, I'm the guy.

404
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,642
- What?
- Mandy,

405
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,267
here's what we're gonna do.

406
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:30,892
I'm gonna make you a decent proposal.

407
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:33,167
Not an indecent proposal
like in the movie...

408
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,928
because I think to pay a
million bucks to get laid...

409
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,553
that's out of the question.

410
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,185
I'm gonna offer you $5,000.

411
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,452
- What are you doing, Frank?
- Look,

412
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,402
I'm gonna give you $5,000, we bang,

413
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,872
you take the money, you go up,
you get on a plane,

414
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:48,276
you fly to wherever the
hell it is in the sticks,

415
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:51,201
and, uh, you know,
$5,000 goes a long way up there.

416
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:53,312
If you need more money, call me up,

417
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,003
come back, we bang again.

418
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,790
Price goes down
'cause I already had you.

419
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:58,414
But if you want to bring a girlfriend...

420
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:00,559
price goes back up.

421
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:06,019
- Well, I don't know what to say here.
- I do.

422
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,747
Five grand is a lot of money...
is that offer just out on the table?

423
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,022
- I'm not gonna bang you.
- I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,

424
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:13,167
- but I'll power through for five grand.
- Well, no, you wouldn't want to,

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,596
because you're emotionally
involved with me.

426
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:16,417
Aw. Shit. Sorry, Dennis.

427
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,359
- Hey. Dennis?
- Brian,

428
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:18,562
I meant. I'm sorry.

429
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:19,796
- Yeah, sometimes...
- Brian is his name.

430
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,649
Dennis is his sex slave name.

431
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,274
- He's my gimp.
- What? No. I...

432
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:24,345
- I don't have a sex slave name.
- Wait.

433
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:25,386
- I'm not...
- Wait, hold on,

434
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:27,173
what's going on here, Brian?

435
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,472
Look,

436
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,358
I'm gonna go to the can
and make my morning move.

437
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,794
You want the cash, you come on in,
earn it the hard way.

438
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:34,582
Okay? If the broad comes,

439
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:37,377
order me an egg.

440
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,706
Well, that was a disaster.
Frank almost ruined everything.

441
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,883
Okay, do you want me to go down
to the car and talk to her?

442
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,905
And spin more perverted tales about me?
Why am I a gimp?

443
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:49,839
Oh, God, just get your kid
and get out of here, Dennis.

444
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Yeah, I'll get the kid,

445
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,476
but I got to come back because
I need to crash here tonight.

446
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,401
I'm not sleeping next
to Mac's dildo bike again.

447
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:55,132
What?

448
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:58,335
No, me too. Your bed is working
wonders for my pinched nerve.

449
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:00,254
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna
crash here for a little bit too.

450
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,143
I feel like I got to ghost the
waitress for a while on this.

451
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,478
I'm gonna stay as well because
I need to sleep next to Dennis.

452
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,810
All right, then
we're gonna need a lot of eggs.

453
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,889
- Dee, how about a carton of eggs?
- Ooh!

454
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,414
No, goddamnit, I didn't want
to be wrapped up in this!

455
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,908
I didn't want to be wrapped
up in the kid thing,

456
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,176
that's your mistake.

457
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,508
Listen to me,

458
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,133
I can figure this out,
I've got a new plan

459
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,815
and you're all gonna
goddamn listen up, okay?

460
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:25,437
It's time for Brian LeFevre to die.

461
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:28,068
- Over here. Over here.
- Hmm?

462
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,148
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- What... where... what is-what is going on here?

463
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,774
I thought-I thought we were
gonna go see the Liberty Bell.

464
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,074
There's no time for that,
there's no time.

465
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:35,428
What... what is going on here, Brian?

466
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:37,797
All right, listen to me,
because we only have a few minutes

467
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:40,000
before they realize
they can't hear or see us back here.

468
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,301
What? Who?

469
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:44,036
My name... my name isn't Brian LeFevre.

470
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,017
My real name...

471
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:48,183
is Dane Brass.

472
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,458
And I hold top secret
government information.

473
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,602
Okay? They're after me, that's-that's
why everything's been so weird.

474
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,357
That's why I haven't been
able to speak openly with you.

475
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,086
And you and Brian Jr.,
you'll have to get away from me

476
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,357
because it's-it's not safe.

477
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:00,196
What do you mean it's not safe?
I don't... Oh, my God.

478
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,017
- You're bleeding!
- Oh...

479
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:04,128
Oh, oh. I've been shot.

480
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,558
Well, I didn't hear any gun...

481
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,182
Oh, well...

482
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:09,124
yeah, not there it is there.
That was the sound of it.

483
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,430
Normally you'd... you'd hear it
before you see the blood,

484
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:13,104
but, uh, not in this case.

485
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:14,218
Run!

486
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,909
Oh, it's killing me. Run, Mandy, no.

487
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,428
You... you have to run
and not ever look back.

488
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:20,921
Or contact me ever again.

489
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:23,241
And you'll never get any
money or assets from me

490
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:24,742
because if you do,
it'll be unsafe for you.

491
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:25,603
Run!

492
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:29,505
Oh, my God!

493
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:30,674
- They got Dennis.
- Dane.

494
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,333
- Uh, Dane, of course, Dane.
- Dane.

495
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,870
Yeah, he had so many identities,
it's hard to remember...

496
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,239
We got to get him to a hospital!

497
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:37,079
Not a regular hospital,
though, 'cause technically,

498
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,494
- he's not supposed to exist.
- A bad guy one.

499
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:39,968
Oh, no, I've lost my lover.

500
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,204
I'll need a new gimp!

501
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,189
I'm not his lover.

502
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,452
Never had sex. Not a gimp.

503
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,015
Oh, run, Mandy. Oh.

504
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:49,880
Good-bye.
Uh... good-bye, Mandy, good-bye.

505
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:54,105
Brian Jr.

506
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,338
Aw.

507
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:56,867
Well, there it is.

508
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,929
Well...

509
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,488
okay.

510
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,437
Are you all finished?

511
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,062
Come on.

512
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:08,401
You can open your eyes now,
I know you're not dead.

513
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:09,708
Ah, geez.

514
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,406
You big city folks sure like
to complicate things, don't ya?

515
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:16,785
Look, all I wanted was for Brian Jr.
to have a father,

516
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:19,743
but we don't want to be with a man
who doesn't want to be with us.

517
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:21,985
So, I guess we'll just...

518
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:23,999
be getting back to North Dakota now.

519
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:25,721
Okay, now,

520
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,385
you want to come on up here
and say good-bye to Brian Jr.?

521
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,628
Oh.

522
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:31,799
Yeah.

523
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,195
Okay.

524
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,990
- Hey.
- Yeah.

525
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,614
Hey, buddy.

526
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:40,020
Um...

527
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:41,969
good-bye and, um...

528
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:43,139
you know, you be...

529
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,732
you be good to your mom and, uh...

530
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:52,237
- Okay, you all done?
- Yeah.

531
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:54,026
All right.

532
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,355
- Okay.
- Okay.

533
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,308
Here we go.

534
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,560
Bye, Dada.

535
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,590
Bye.

536
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:12,710
Well, all right.

537
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,277
It was sure nice
getting to know you all.

538
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:17,096
Whoever the heck you are.

539

♪ What you gonna do when
you get out of jail? ♪

540
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,806

♪ Fun, natural fun. ♪

543
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,360
I can't do this.

544
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,224
What are you talking about, bud?
The plan worked.

545
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,584
No, this... no, this-this is crazy.

546
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:53,370
What are we doing?
I can't... I-I can't...

547
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,157
- I can't do any of this shit anymore.
- What?

548
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,270
What's going on?

549
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,895
Okay, I'm... I'm leaving.

550
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:00,055
I'm gonna go be a dad.

551
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,444
Well, hold on a-hold on a second,
you can't just leave.

552
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,043
Yeah, you can't just go
become a dad, Dennis.

553
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:07,702
That's not the way it works.

554
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,457
You don't know the first thing about it.

555
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,894
Well, you know what, Frank,
I'll figure it out, okay?

556
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,720
Because I don't want my
kid to grow up like I did.

557
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:17,093
With some asshole dad who
was never even around.

558
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,879
You talking about me or Bruce?

559
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,569
You!

560
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:22,325
Okay, you know what? I... this is nuts.

561
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:23,592
I got to... I just got to go.

562
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,086
It's done. It's done, guys.

563
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:26,255
Good-bye, Paddy's Pub.

564
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,173
Good-bye, Philadelphia.

565
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,091
Good-bye, Charlie.

566
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,284
Mac, Dee, Frank.

567
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,681
The bar's done.

568
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,230
- Well, hang on a second.
- Actually,

569
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:41,391
- it's not done.
- It's not done, no.

570
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:42,392
We're still in here.

571
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,219
Shh, just let me...

572
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:56,412
Don't start talking, I can tell...

573
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:58,200
- We weren't gonna say anything.
- The pause is too big.

574
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,661
Well, this is, again,
this is why I'm leaving.

575
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,294
Oh, good-bye.

576
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,048
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

577
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,884
- Hmm.
- Bye.

578
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:06,885
Hmm.

579
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,410
I can't believe he's actually gone.

580
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,847
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

581
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,487
Well, now what?

582
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,220
What a shot, man!

583
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:24,682
Oh, my God!

584
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:25,902
Whoa!

585
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:47,318
