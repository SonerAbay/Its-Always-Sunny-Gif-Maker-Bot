1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,796
[Frank] Hey, hey!
What do you think of these, guys?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,840
[Mac]
My God, Frank. My God.

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,592
You look ridiculous in those, dude.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,637
Dude, why are you wearing skinny jeans?
Because they're hip.

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,098
And I want to stay young.
Well, stay old, bro.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,016
Because that looks terrible.
Dress your age.

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,185
I like 'em. I think they
make me look sexy. [Laughs]

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,689
I am getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment
watching you parade around in those things.

9
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,816
- So I say keep them.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,819
It's like a Humpty Dumpty vibe going on
with those. I don't know if you want...

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,655
Yo-oh! Big news, bitches!
The ban's been lifted.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,908
And we are back in.
Flipadelphia, here we come!

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,662
Ohh!
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,747
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

15
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:40,832
Flip!
Flip!

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,334
Flip- Yeah!
Adelphia!

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,337
What the hell is Flipadelphia?
What is Flipadelphia?

18
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:49,048
Dude, it's a city-wide
flip cup tournament. It's the best.

19
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,051
Yeah. We were the bar to beat
10 years ago until we got muscled out.

20
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:55,054
Yeah. They very, very unfairly accused
us of poisoning our rival team.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,681
Yes.
You got framed?

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,142
No, we did poison the shit out of them.
But they didn't have any proof.

23
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,811
So you have a rival?
Oh, yeah, big-time.

24
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,730
This dive bar down the
street called Molly's. Yeah.

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,357
Yeah, yeah. This year we're gonna
jam it right up their butt holes.

26
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:11,738
Ohh! Wow. Yeah, me, Dennis and
Charlie will jam their butt holes.

27
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,324
You're not gonna come anywhere near their butt holes.
Let us handle the butt holes.

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,036
What are you talking about?
You guys, I- I'm your number four.

29
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,122
I'm your "Adelphia.
" And you can't- Yeah, I know.

30
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,250
But, Dee, I mean, what, do you,
like, not remember the past?

31
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,170
You choked under pressure in '98.
You blew the whole thing.

32
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,922
We were gonna win. And then
you couldn't flip your damn cup over.

33
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,216
I know, Charlie! That's why
I've been practicing ever since.

34
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,510
I mean, you gotta give me
a chance to redeem myself.

35
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,554
Okay, fine. You will have
a chance to redeem yourself.

36
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,433
In the meantime, what do you say we
throw a little gas on the rivalry fire?

37
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,969
[Frank] I thought you said
this place was a shithole.

38
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,806
Yeah, it was. But looks like
they've made a few renovations.

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,808
All right, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

40
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,851
Could be a scheme.
Okay, you guys ready?

41
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,937
Probably, yeah.
Guess who, bitches!

42
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,898
[Shouting]
Are you guys hungry, huh?

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,026
Enjoying your meals?
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

44
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,987
Oh, everybody have some lemon on it.
Yeah.

45
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,114
Honk, honk, honk.

46
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,868
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

47
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:46,791
Will they highest ranking member
of the staff please step forward?

48
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,294
I'm, uh, Art Sloan.
I'm the owner. Huh?

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,464
[Laughing]
Uh, you're Art Sloan?

50
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,508
Now see, you look very different
from what I remember.

51
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,510
Do I know you people?

52
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,722
Uh, allow me to refresh
your memory. Ohh!

53
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,558
Whoa, whoa.
What- What the hell is that?

54
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,186
Flip cup. Ten years ago?
We poisoned you, dude. Remember?

55
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,981
Oh, wait a minute, yeah.
We got really sick. Yeah.

56
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,066
You acted sick.
But check it out.

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,736
Who's to say we didn't put that very
same poison in the drinking water?

58
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,447
- [All Groaning]
- Hey, everybody, relax.

59
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,909
He's lying. He doesn't have any poison.
No, I don't have any on me.

60
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,496
But I do keep some in my fridge
at home in the relish jar.

61
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,958
There's poison in that jar?
I thought I was allergic to pickles.

62
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
What's in the jar with
the skull and crossbones?

63
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,837
Oh, that's mayonnaise.
That's a decoy.

64
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,964
- And the mayo?
- That's shampoo.

65
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,091
You're telling me I've been putting
shampoo on my sandwiches?

66
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,802
If you're using the mayonnaise,
yeah, probably. I-I'm sorry.

67
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,846
Is there something that
I can do for you people?

68
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,641
Yeah! We came to tell you
we're reigniting the rivalry, dick worm.

69
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,769
- It's back on, bitch! - You know what?
I-I am not your rival, okay?

70
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,231
I never was. And I am certainly not
participating in Flipadelphia.

71
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,442
Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!

72
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,986
Flip, flip- Oh!
Looks like someone's scared, guys.

73
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,739
Now you're just being childish.
[Dee] Oh, yeah?

74
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,782
How's this for childish, bro?
[Urinating]

75
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,368
All right, that's it!
I'm calling the cops.

76
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,037
He pissed on your bar!
Yeah, call the cops!

77
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,622
See you Saturday. Don't be late.

78
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,669
Three, two, one, go!

79
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,048
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

80
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,091
No, no.
[All Shouting]

81
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,093
No, you're doing it too high!
Get it! Get it!

82
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,638
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

83
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,474
I don't know, you guys. I was...

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,517
That was terrible!
I'm sorry, okay?

85
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,728
I thought you had been practicing.
I have been practicing!

86
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,105
I don't know what happened!
You know, it's her bison-sized fingers!

87
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,274
I don't have bison fingers!
I don't have bison fingers. Oh, yes, you do.

88
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,944
Your mother had to have a C-section
because of those hands.

89
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,904
Okay, you guys are just
all screaming in my face!

90
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,989
People are going to scream
at the tournament!

91
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,033
That's it. She's off the team.
Shut up, Frank!

92
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,411
You're not even on the team!
That's true. What is my role here?

93
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,288
Why did you bring that up?
Yeah. All right.

94
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,290
You're not gonna be on the flip cup team.
No. Definitely not.

95
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,876
Maybe you could be, um, team instigator.
Yeah! There we go.

96
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,628
That works. I'll be the instigator.
Sure. Yeah.

97
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,255
Okay. I'll instigate. In the meantime,
we need to find a replacement for Dee.

98
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,466
We need a replacement. No! No, no, no, no, no!
That's not fair, you guys.

99
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,385
Don't replace me!
You're being replaced.

100
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,428
Okay. I'll tell you what, Dee.
If you can prove to us...

101
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,556
that you can flip 10 cups in a row
under pressure, you're back on the team.

102
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,892
Yes! Okay, I gotta practice.
That's all I need. All right.

103
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,603
I gotta warm up. You see, I went into this cold.
I came in here cold.

104
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,272
That's what my problem was.
One mistake and you're off the team.

105
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,233
That oughta keep her busy
for at least a week or so.

106
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,360
I don't think she'll ever get that.
Okay, in the meantime,

107
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,737
let's find a replacement. Yes.
And I know just the place to go.

108
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,824
Where? Same place I learned to
hone my God-given flip cup skills.

109
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,077
The Delta Omega Lambda
fraternity house at Penn. Wait.

110
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,288
That was, like, 15 years ago.
I don't think you'd have any clout there.

111
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,041
It doesn't matter, man. I was the king of that place.
I'm a legend over there.

112
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,347
Oh. This brings me back.

113
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,267
Got the alumni's up here. Nice.

114
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,146
[Chuckles] Oh, man.

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,899
This is the class.
Oh, man. There's Ritter.

116
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,986
Oh, that's- "I chug dick"? No.

117
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,740
What? I never-
I don't chug dick. That's crazy.

118
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,241
Why would you even put-
That's not funny.

119
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,996
Come on, that's homophobic.
I mean, come on. What the hell?

120
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,081
Bitch!
Pick it back up!

121
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,792
[Man]
No, shake the ass! Shake the ass!

122
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,628
[All Shouting]
Yeah, there you go!

123
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,883
- Like this! - Frank?
What the hell are you doing, man?

124
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,553
I'm recruiting these guys for the flip cup thing.
I almost got this, Dennis.

125
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,264
Whoo-whoo-whoo!
Yeah!

126
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,683
All right!
That's real funny shit, Frank!

127
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,062
Step out for a second and let me handle this.
All right, guys- [Laughs]

128
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,397
I'm Brother Reynolds, class of '98.

129
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,858
Dude, we were cruising
in sixth grade in '98, man.

130
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,736
Oh, sixth grade? Cool, man.
Well, I guess I kind of blazed the trail...

131
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,197
for these sorts of shenanigans
you guys got going on in here.

132
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,241
- What's going on with this kid?
- Oh, he's a pledge.

133
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,079
And we're zapping his nuts
with a stun gun every couple of hours.

134
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,247
- Oh!
- Look at him, man!

135
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,917
That's brutal, man. Wow.
Let me- Let me get in on that.

136
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,418
You- You want to get in on this?
Yeah.

137
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,796
I'm sort of a legend when it
comes to this kind of shit. So, yeah.

138
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,716
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Cool.
Here, man. - [All Laughing]

139
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,803
- Down he goes!
- Oh, shit! That really hurts!

140
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:13,015
Dennis, these guys are badass shitheads!
Oh, man! You got any ludes?

141
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,726
Ludes? I don't think they
make those anymore, man. No?

142
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,686
We got Ritarall.
Ritarall?

143
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:22,358
Yeah. What's Ritarall?
Oh, snortski. Ohh. Mmm.

[Inhales]
Ooh! Ooh, that's tasty stuff.

Uh, God.
Zap him again.

Huh?
[Screams]

- Don't do that shit again, you little idiot!

148
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,791
Okay? Have some respect for a brother,
okay? I'm a legend around this place.

149
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,586
So don't zap me again! All right, listen.
I came here for a reason, okay?

150
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,880
I came here to recruit you
for a flip cup tournament.

151
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,425
Flip cup? Flip cup? What are you, a freshman?
That is so lame.

study on this goddamn Ritarall.

Oh, it was bad.

punked, Frank. We both got punked!

That's right. These kids these
days, I'll tell you what.

166

They're nothing like we used to be
back when we were in fraternities.

167

They have no respect for anybody, okay?
They're like stupid little goddamn savages.

I came in there, right?
And I was polite, and I was nice to them.

170
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,063
I was cordial. And they completely
goddamn disrespected me!

Little idiots! Idiots!
Yeah.

172
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,860
I was completely respectful.
They're supposed to be my brothers, right?

173
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,820
They're my brothers?
No, no. That's not fun.

174
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,364
What they were doing wasn't fun.
They kept zapping us and zapping us.

Idiots! Savages! Idiots!
No, zap, zap, zap, zap.

viciousness of youth.

I'll tell you what, dude.

183
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,093
Maybe you should step down
from the fraternity thing.

184
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,512
Look, we haven't gotten Art Sloan to sign up yet.
He has not signed up.

185
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,514
Why don't you focus some
of that weird rage on him?

186
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,142
- Charlie and I'll handle the frat
kids from here, okay? - Yeah, yeah.

187
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,186
I'll totally pull
a Good Will Hunting on those kids...

188
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,022
and that'll put 'em in their place.
How are you gonna do that?

189
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,066
Well, you've seen the movie, right?
Yeah.

190
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,862
So all I gotta do is I'll ask them some
like big shot, like, math or science,

191
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,864
history-type college question...

192
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,159
and then I'll totally stump them by knowing
a lot more about the answer than they do.

193
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:42,081
Yeah, in that movie, Matt Damon played a
genius janitor. You're just a janitor.

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,751
Right.
[Chuckles]

195
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,712
You stumped me with that one.
That's a good point.

00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,714
You didn't have a comeback for that.

197
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,716
How are you gonna have
a comeback in the frat house?

198
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,594
Then you ask them the math
or history-type question...

199
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,056
Ah, but you're not a janitor.
Don't do that.

00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,767
Just, please, please take care
of those little savages. Got it.

201
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,395
Don't do that. Don't do that.
It'll work if you just say some lines from the movie.

202
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,648
It works. Flip. That's too big.
