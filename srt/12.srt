1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,336
[ frank laughing ]
these things are hilarious.

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,872
[ charlie ] these are priceless.
[ dee ]
what are you guys lookin' at?

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,009
Uh, garbage pail kids.
Heavin' steven.

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,344
Classic.
Totally classic.
I love heavin' steven.

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,848
Are those those stupid cards
where babies are doing
disgusting things?

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:20,152
Uh, no. They're the amazing
cards where babies are
doing hysterical things.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,554
You got quite
a collection
there, buddy.

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,891
Yes, I do.
Hey, charlie, how about
givin' me a couple of these?

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,893
Uh, no.
[ chuckles ]
I tell you what.

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,195
I'll buy 'em from you.
You got a ton of 'em.

11
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,197
No. These are, like,
an investment.

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,700
This is my future here,
so don't mess with them.
<i>[ door opens ]</i>

13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,769
Hey, have you guys
seen this?

14
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,271
We are getting
blasted in the ass
by the state liquor tax.

15
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,073
"blasted in the ass"?

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,308
Mac, we have this
same conversation
every year.

17
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,310
There's nothing you can do
about taxes.

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,380
You guys might want
to think about voting
every once in a while.

19
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,483
What has voting ever done?
Why-- since wh--
what has--

20
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,453
- <i>why are you comin' down--</i>
<i>voting?</i>
<i>- who am I supposed to vote for?</i>

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,156
Am I supposed to vote for
the democrat who's gonna
blast me in the ass...

22
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,158
Or the republican
who's blasting my ass?

23
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,226
Politics is just
one big ass blast.

24
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,962
It is a coast-to-coast,
nationwide ass blast.
You're gonna get your ass--

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,964
No more! You guys
are such morons.

26
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,568
If you knew anything at all
about politics, you would know
that that is not true.

27
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,338
Deandra, it's just some jerk
gettin' into office...

28
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,273
So he can get out
for the payday.

29
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,810
Right. The guy's runnin'
for office. He's-- what?
What payday?

30
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,812
I see it every year.

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,349
Some clown runs for office,
drops out of the race...

32
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,451
And gets
a big chunk of dough.

33
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:30,889
I mean, you have to be a real
low-life piece of shit...

34
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,991
To get involved in politics.

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,664
Okay. I just got off the phone
with the city clerk.

36
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,667
Turns out
there's an election comin' up.

37
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,935
Local, small-time shit.
Anybody can run.
What's the position?

38
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,673
"south philly, zone 2,
district 37 comptroller.

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,509
Nice. What's a comptroller?
Who gives a shit?
We're doin' it for the bribe.

40
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,511
I nominate dennis.

41
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,614
- I accept your nomination.
- wait a minute. How come
he gets to be the candidate?

42
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,083
Take a look at that hair--
kennedy hair.

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,852
Note the bone structure.
It's like a young j.F.K.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,890
- I got the same bone structure.
- [ others hemming and hawing ]

45
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,359
What are you making that noise--
what is that about?

46
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,462
You got something funky
goin' on in the forehead area.
Five head.

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,798
Did you say five head?
I don't have that.

48
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,468
Deandra, a woman in politics
is like a donkey doing calculus.

49
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,204
Come on. There are plenty
of amazing women politicians.

50
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,441
- name one.
- uh, senator
hillary rodham clinton.

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,743
- awful.
- how is she awful?

52
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,145
- hates freedom.
- uh--

53
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,981
Okay, dennis, you are gonna
need a campaign manager.
That's me.

54
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,551
So--
ooh. We should
put that one to a vote.

55
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,553
'cause I'd be
a good campaign manager.

56
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,488
It's too late. I already
have the clipboard.

57
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,125
So you can be
my assistant.
Mmm. Assistant is--

58
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,461
- should I wear a blazer?
- yes.
- no.

59
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,629
- yes.
- no.
- I like what he said.

60
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,631
Charlie? Campaign manager.
You don't need a blazer.

61
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,567
A blazer's
gonna look--
I like where he's goin'.

62
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,303
- what am I gonna do?
- [ sighs ]
you get to be the intern.

63
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,338
Yeah, the intern.
What does an intern do?

64
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,274
Cut limes.
Stock glasses.
Serve drinks.

65
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,144
[ all chattering ]
no. No. Come on.
You guys, damn you!

66
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,146
I'm not doing that.
Hold it! Hold it!

67
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,750
If my son is gonna
solicit a bribe, he's
gonna do it the right way.

68
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,153
- I'm gonna be
campaign manager.
- like hell you are.

69
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,555
You are way too old.
Politics is a young man's
game.

70
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,924
Mac, I think you might be
in over your head here.
Yeah.

71
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,160
- over my head?
- yeah. Listen.

72
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,031
Everybody who's
in favor of firing mac
as campaign manager,

73
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,033
Raise their hand.

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,536
For god sakes!
The people have spoken.
You're out.

75
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,005
So that's it? I'm fired?
This is bullshit!

76
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,342
That's politics, man.
That's politics?
That's politics?

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,844
This is wonderful.
This is just wonderful.
You know what?

78
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,913
I'm walkin' outta here.
I don't need this shit.

79
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,549
I'm washin' my hands
of the whole situation.
Show you, bitches.

80
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,686
Can I grab that clipboard?
No. That's mine.

81
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,724
Dee, check out my blazer.

82
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,927
Yeah. It's too small.
Nah. It's perfect.

83
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:26,165
How's the bar?
Full of hoboes, dennis.
A lot of hoboes.

84
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,468
Watch your ears.
There you go.
Frank.

85
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,939
Frank, I don't-- I just don't
think this is the best idea
for our candidate's image.

86
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,142
This is a brilliant idea--
"hobo-vertising."

87
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,813
Come on. It looks good.
Beer him.
[ sighs ]

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,183
- <i>we gotta fire frank.</i>
<i>- he's my dad, charlie.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

89
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,585
But, dennis. Dennis.
Hobo-vertising?

90
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,821
That's not you.
It's cheap.
Ooh.

91
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,291
It's cheap politics.
It's not gonna get us
that bribe.

92
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,360
I mean, you need
to be out there.

93
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,830
You gotta be shakin' hands.
You gotta be kissin' babies.

94
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,765
I don't like babies.

95
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,767
No babies.
Don't kiss babies.

96
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,570
Just get out there
into the world, and--

97
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,907
You gotta let me be
your campaign manager.

98
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,977
I mean, I can
really drive this thing
in a different direction.

99
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,780
I mean, when I look at you,
I see success.
[ exhaling ]

100
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:18,317
I see-- you're top-notch.
You're goin' all the way
with this thing.

101
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,586
Oh.
Frank's just gettin'
in the way here.

102
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,857
Give me this chance.
Just give it to me.

103
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:29,028
I just didn't realize
I was gonna have to make
so many... Tough decisions.

104
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,403
Take him down.
[ gasps ]

105
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,271
This is a goddamn coup!

106
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,306
Don't take it personally, dad.
That's just politics.

107
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,642
You look like a dick
in that tiny jacket.

108
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,711
Let's not attack
my candidate.
Don't go after the jacket.

109
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,579
Shut up, charlie.
The jacket's good.

110
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,715
I can talk to my son
any way I want.

111
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,818
- give him the clipboard.
- give me the clipboard.
- no. No.

112
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,154
Clipboard belongs
to the campaign manager.
I want that clipboard.

113
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,489
- go to hell.
- oh, that was ugly.

114
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,759
That was uncalled for.
Mmm.

115
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,929
Wow. That was, uh, a lot easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

116
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,998
I can get a clipboard
anywhere.
Yeah.

117
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,834
All right.
Don't do that.

118
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,542
I want you to run
for comptroller.
What?

119
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,811
I'm gonna be
your campaign manager.

120
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,315
We're gonna stroll right into
that comptroller's office
and solicit a bribe.

121
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,086
Forget it.
I am not helping you.
Deandra, we'll get this bribe,

122
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,154
And we'll shove it
right in your brother's face.

123
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,991
We'll screw those guys.
I would like
to shove it in his face.

124
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,993
Okay.

125
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,763
Okay. Now let's get you ready
for the ball, cinderella.

126
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:42,868
What are you doing?
The bangs, they--
the five head.

127
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,774
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>
<i>You want to try</i>
<i>and solicit a bribe?</i>

128
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,776
Yes!

129
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,078
You want my union
to back your roommate...

130
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,280
For south philly
district 37 comptroller?

131
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,983
Yes. Correct.
But not to win.

132
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,686
It sounds illegal.
Aw, for god sakes.

133
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,088
What is with you two?
Come on!

134
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,159
You know, like, in the movies,
union guys are, like, tough
and shady and shit.

135
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,329
Sorry to disappoint you.
You're, like, a couple
of nerds.

136
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:15,034
[ sighs ] all right, look.
Let me take you bitches
to school for a second.

137
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,804
In this country,
in the real world,
people make money.

138
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,306
Somebody is gonna
make a ton of money
off my roommate.

139
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,043
I want it to be you.
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

140
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,645
We are not
a criminal organization.

141
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,849
Why are you talking to me
like I'm a jackass?
I am not a ja--

142
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,686
Oh. I see what you're doin'.

143
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,890
[ loudly ]
okay. Nobody here
is a criminal. No, sir.

144
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,392
[ whispering ]
I think we're speaking
the same language.

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,429
- are we?
- oh, yeah.

146
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,665
We're being listened to.
Bugged. The feds. I get it.

147
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,668
I read. I see movies.
I understand. Okay.

148
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,737
I want you to contact me
at paddy's.

149
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,606
I'm gonna get
the ball rolling, okay?
Mm-hmm.

150
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,809
It's safe there.

151
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,211
[ loudly ]
okay, gentlemen, sorry we
couldn't work anything out.

152
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,181
But, uh, I'm gonna go home
and pay my taxes.

153
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,450
Right?

154
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,687
You want me
to call the cops?
Not yet.

155
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,690
I've got a better idea.
Let's screw this
son of a bitch.

156
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,759
Come on, morris.
We don't have time for this.

157
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,561
He called us nerds, gary.

158
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,198
Nerds.

159
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,969
Are you gonna take care
of the crime problem here?

160
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:28,007
Absolutely. I say we put 'em on
busses, ship 'em over to iraq--
make 'em fight the terrorists.

161
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,642
You're very handsome.

162
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,711
Thank you.
This is going
very, very well, man.

163
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,014
People are really
responding to me.
They love the bone structure.

164
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,116
They like the kennedy hair.
I've been looking
for you guys.

165
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,120
Look, I've been thinkin',
and I feel like I could be
a real asset to you guys.

166
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,222
- I want to help.
- what? Wait, wait.

167
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,692
First you wash your hands
of politics.
Now you want back in.

168
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,194
That's called flip-flopping.
That's what democrats do.
Hang on a second.

169
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,196
Let's give the guy
a chance to prove himself.

170
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,866
Yeah. Give me a chance.
What should I do?

171
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,868
"what should I do?"
strike one, buddy.

172
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,237
You gotta bring something
to the table, mac.

173
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,506
All right.
Ah, check this out.

174
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,908
<i>Excuse me. Hi.</i>

175
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,611
I couldn't help but notice
your adorable baby.
Oh, thank you.

176
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,180
Yeah, I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind...

177
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,149
<i>If that handsome</i>
<i>young gentleman</i>
<i>over there kissed it.</i>

178
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,384
Excuse me?
Oh. I'm sorry.

179
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,387
He's running for
district 37 comptroller,
so it's cool.

180
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,224
- you know, I'd rather not.
- it's good for him,
and it's good for you.

181
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,994
I think you should just
give me the baby.
Please leave me alone.

182
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,996
Okay, lady.
[ baby crying ]

183
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,065
If you give me the baby,
I could get it over with.

184
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,233
I said no!
Goddamn it!
Just give me the baby!

185
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,536
Somebody help me!
Lady! Give me the ba--

186
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,206
This is
campaign suicide, dude.
Let's get outta here.

187
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,044
<i>There, there, there.</i>

188
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,347
There, there, there.
Take a look.

189
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,415
Got it on? Sure?
Yeah. Take a look.

190
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,985
What do you think?
I think I look
like a whore.

191
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,321
I'm trying
to make you sexy.
This is not sexy.

192
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,191
What is this?
What's this?
It's the bed look.

193
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,259
The tossed look.
The ruffled look.

194
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,628
You look like
you just got--
[ mutters ]

195
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,630
Anyway, we have
to convince this guy...
[ sighs ]

196
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,899
That we're a legitimate
threat to his campaign.

197
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,469
There is nothing
more threatening
to a man...

198
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,238
Than a woman
who is smart
and attractive.

199
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,541
We have to pretend
you're both.

200
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,610
Wow. You're
a horrible father.

201
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,248
Let's just go.
Let's get it done.
Great. Great.

202
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,318
Now, daddy hates
to say this, but...
[ sighs ]

203
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,154
I think we should talk
about the breasts.

204
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,491
"oh, don't hurt my baby."
like I'm gonna hurt
somebody's baby.

205
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,860
You know what I mean?
Goddamn dennis. Fire me?

206
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,929
I'll fire you.
<i>Mac. Get in.</i>

207
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,668
We got a bribe
for your roommate's
withdrawal from the race.

208
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,704
Really? Wow.
You nerds work fast.

209
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,773
All right.
How much did we get?

210
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,376
We don't get any money
until you pull your guy
from the race.

211
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,212
Oh.

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,181
<i>Okay, uh--</i>

213
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,350
That's not gonna be
a problem, is it?

214
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,352
No. That's not gonna be
a problem.

215
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,354
Better not be, mac.

216
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,723
Otherwise, marvin here is gonna
have to take care of you.

217
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,826
Take care of me how?

218
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,562
[ softly ]
I'll probably
stab you in your throat.

219
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,998
Jesus christ!
Stab me in my throat?

220
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,134
- are you serious?
- pull your guy out, mac.

221
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,437
I'm gonna pull him out.
I'm gonna pull him out,
marvin.

222
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,540
Marvin, I'm gonna
pull him out. Okay.

223
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,775
Who's the nerd now, bitch?
[ chuckling ]

224
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,144
That was fun.
I feel like a gangster.

225
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,014
Shut up, gary.

226
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,884
I'm not dropping out.

227
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,987
- bro, you have
to drop out.
- why?

228
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,457
I didn't wanna say this before,
but you don't have kennedy hair.

229
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,559
All right! Oh, god!
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>the jawline.</i>

230
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,662
- how could you say that?
- if I hear one more
flip-flop out of you,

231
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,731
I'm gonna throw up
in my mouth.

232
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,066
You ready to do this?
I'm just doing
some fine-tuning.

233
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,035
It looks good.
Just trying
to get my tan on.

234
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,270
Let's hurry.
The battery on this
drains like a tub.

235
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,773
What is going on in here?
Are those beach towels?

236
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,143
We're gonna shoot a commercial,
get it on public access,
get the message out.

237
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,679
- it's a million-dollar bill
pal.
- yeah. A million-dollar bill.

238
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,681
You guys are never gonna
get a bribe.

239
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,283
It's not about the bribe
anymore.
We don't care about that.

240
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,586
I could be
a legitimate politician.
He's goin' to the top.

241
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,288
- really do some good
in philadelphia.
- are you listening to yourself?

242
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,892
- you've never done any good
for anybody ever!
- I do good! I do good!

243
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,129
- you never do anything!
You're a loser!
- you're just jealous!

244
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,865
I'm not jealous!
All right! All right!
That's--

245
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,300
That's no way to run
a campaign, boys.

246
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,703
Let's have the conversation
outside.
All right. We'll talk outside.

247
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,872
Yeah, we'll make you happy.
You're droppin' out
of that race.

<i>Yes, I did.</i>

You are going to hell,

Mmm, I don't think so.

No, no! Please. Read it.
I think you might be

You want me
to read the script?

Yes. And action.
All right.

266
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,025

00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,901
Looks like you bitches
shouldn't have fired me
in the first place.

433
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,570
Are you kiddin' me?
Are you kiddin' me
with that?

434
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:15,107
I'm gonna buy myself a car.
I am gonna drive as far away
from this goddamn city--

435
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,309
Hey, mac.
Where you runnin' to?

436
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,977
Huh?

437
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,448
Goin' to visit your friend
over at the union?

438
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,050
What's goin' on?
Is there a problem?

439
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,386
I don't know.
Phil, is there a problem?

440
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,756
Conspiracy
to solicit a bribe.
Racketeering.

441
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,758
I'd say
there's a big problem.

442
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,561
Your buddy over at the union
came to see us recently.

443
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,497
Told us about
your interest in politics.

444
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,901
- he ratted you out, mac.
- apparently, you called him
a nerd, mac.

445
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,137
Some people don't take kindly
to that type of insult.

446
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,273
Yeah. You're goin' away
for a long time,

447
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,043
And prison can be
a very unpleasant place...

448
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,579
For a good-lookin'
young man like yourself.

449
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,981
Oh, yeah. They're gonna
tear through you
like kleenex.

450
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,983
That is, of course,

451
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,520
Unless you got something
to make it worth our while.

452
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,324
Are you soliciting a bribe
from me?

453
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:10,029
Sorry, pal.
That's politics.

454
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:54,206
