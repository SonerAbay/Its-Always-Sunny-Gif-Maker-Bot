1
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:05,085
<i>Oh, that's fresh, dude.
Yeah, that's real nice.</i>

2
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,054
<i>Seriously, you're gonna bring
that up again? Jerry, Jerry,</i>

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,856
Jerry... I'm so sick of hearing
about Jerry, man.

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:11,091
- Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.
- Hey, hey, hey, uh,

5
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,146
Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.

6
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:13,147
- This one's tapped, buddy.
- Yeah, give me a second.

7
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:15,763
Like, if Jerry jumped off a
bridge would you jump off it, too?

8
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,297
- Which bridge?
- Guys, guys...

9
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,699
- Which bridge, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,401
Guys, guys, please stop arguing, okay?
Can you just...

11
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,609
can you do your jobs today?
We got a bunch of customers in here.

12
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:23,604
I want to take advantage of it.

13
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,572
Look, can you just tell him
to get rid of Jerry first?

14
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,007
I'm sorry,
I don't even know who that is.

15
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,976
- My tapeworm.
- You have a tapeworm?

16
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:29,977
- Yeah, he got a worm.
- Yeah. Got a tapeworm.

17
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:30,878
And you named it?

18
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:32,079
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

19
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,347
Yeah, okay, great. Look, guys,
can we not do this?

20
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:35,783
Can we not talk about worms
or sewers or rats today, with all these

21
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:37,718
people in here?
We got a good thing going.

22
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,920
- Charlie, new keg.
- Well, I just think maybe I'm a little sensitive

23
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:42,029
because it's Valentine's
Day and I don't really

24
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:43,652
want to hear about Jerry all day long.

25
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:44,425
But, yeah, fine, what do you want...

26
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,926
you want me to put pink ink in
the beer or something,

27
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,561
- make it all inky and pink?
- I... No, no, no, no.

28
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,396
I don't want to do
Valentine's Day shit, okay?

29
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:51,298
I don't want to do that.
All right, look, all these people

30
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,300
are in here today because they
don't have people who love them

31
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,269
and get them shit on Valentine's Day.
All right?

32
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,504
So, can we not remind them
of that with inky beer?

33
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,239
All right, fine. Can you just
tell him to get lost, then?

34
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,741
And then we'll go back
to the way things were.

35
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,042
- Who?
- Jerry.

36
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:03,644
- The worm?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,287
It's an intestinal parasite,
incapable of complex thought.

38
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:08,515
You just described my ex-husband.

39
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:10,651
- Oh...
- Oh...

40
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:11,856
- Yeah, he's a...
- He can't think, yeah.

41
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:12,657
That's pretty funny.

42
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:14,888
- Hey, Dee! Yeah!
- All right, Dee!

43
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:18,058
Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!

44
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,693
Dee is in the house, uh,
Dee is in the house,

45
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,662
- uh, Dee is in the house.
- Oh... - Oh...

46
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,497
- Thanks for the chant, guys. What's up?
- Yeah, no,

47
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:25,733
we were talking about the new Dee,
the funny one.

48
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:26,635
- Her?
- Yeah.

49
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:27,736
- Yeah.
- Why are you calling her Dee?

50
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,070
Oh, well, she's like a new regular.
She's been coming in here.

51
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,271
You know, trying
to make her feel more at home.

52
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:34,074
- It's a nickname, short for Dottie.
- Then call her Dot.

53
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,443
Nah, we already started calling
her Dee and it kind of stuck.

54
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,312
You know, can't really change it now.
It's locked in.

55
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,680
That's my nickname, bitch.
Don't you take my nickname.

56
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:41,081
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

57
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,883
- You bitch! Get out of here!
- What are you...

58
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,251
Don't-don't yell at the customers, okay?

59
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:45,886
Look, we got a good thing
going here, all right?

60
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:47,421
We got a bunch of new customers in here.

61
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:49,123
We got a regular,
we might get more regulars.

62
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,691
- Let's not screw this up.
- Guys, guys.

63
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,960
- I've got news, I've got glorious news.
- Oh!

64
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:55,028
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

65
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:56,730
Mac is in the house,
Mac is in the house.

66
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,732
Thanks for the chant, guys.
Listen, I need everybody

67
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:00,734
to drop everything and
come out to the back alley.

68
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,036
There is an unopened crate out there.

69
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:04,938
- An un... an unopened crate?
- Crate? Oh! - Crate?

70
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,040
- Hey, there's a crate!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

71
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:07,858
- We got a crate.
- Let's go!

72
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:08,759
- We have a crate.
- No.

73
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:10,077
- What, what?
- Stop, hey, stop!

74
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:11,378
- What? What?
- Stop! Stop.

75
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,247
We got a bar full of customers here.

76
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,349
So what? Oh! Oh, shit, okay,
okay, you know what I'll do?

77
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,284
Um, I can put a fan
next to the yuck puddle,

78
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,186
- and the smell's gonna clear everybody out.
- Oh!

79
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,788
I don't want to clear everybody out.
I'm saying

80
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,456
why are we running out
of the bar to-to look

81
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:24,992
- in some dumb crate?
- Well, it's not about the crate.

82
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:26,326
It's about the mystery of
what's inside the crate

83
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:27,728
- that gets us.
- Yeah, the straw.

84
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,573
- Yeah. Well, not the straw, though.
- No.

85
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:30,544
- Not the straw?
- No, not the straw.

86
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:31,845
- Whatever's in the crate, like...
- Oh.

87
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,375
- Yeah, it's worth a look.
- It's not worth a look.

88
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,102
It's trash. There's nothing in there.
There never is.

89
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:36,303
This is what I'm saying. Why...

90
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,805
We're always running outside,

91
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,706
out into the world,
looking for riches and treasures

92
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,009
when we've got everything
we need right here.

93
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:45,078
Oh, you're saying we do, like,
a booze for money type scheme.

94
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,964
That's good. Who came up with that?

95
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:47,665
- Oh. Was it me?
- Who came up with that?

96
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,416
Whoever invented the idea of a bar.

97
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,084
Which is what we decided to do years ago

98
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,420
when we bought this goddamn place.
So, can we please,

99
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:55,222
for once in our lives,
not go chasing after crates?

100
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:57,324
You know, and talk about worms?

101
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,159
Right?
Yelling at the customers and shit?

102
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:02,095
Can we just do the one
thing we've never tried?

103
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,631
Can we just do our jobs?

104
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,149
'89, good.

105
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,153
Damn drunks.

106
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,857
Rum and Coke, tequila soda.

107
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:41,325
Pay me.

108
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:45,262
All right, that's gonna be five.

109
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:46,730
Out of 20.

110
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,030
Yup.

111
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,631
Aw, she wants another mojito.

112
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,366
Looks like our regular's
got herself a usual.

113
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,701
You bet.

114
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,304
Yo. I am all done with my work.

115
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,072
Can we go check out that crate now?

116
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,507
What? You're not done.

117
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,842
Shit, how'd you know?

118
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,110
Because the bar's still open.

119
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,845
You're not done till we close.

120
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,546
Hey, what do you say you
and me go out the back

121
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,148
and check out that crate.
Just the two of us...

122
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,383
No one else has to know.
Just to get it off our minds.

123
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,519
It's not on my mind, okay?
Let it go. Christ, five people

124
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,354
have walked in here since we
started this conversation.

125
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,423
Can you go check their IDs
so we don't get another

126
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,291
underage drinking
situation on our hands?

127
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,926
- Just got my mind on that crate.
- Right, well,

128
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,394
- get your mind on your job.
- Done, done, done.

129
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,474
- Done with my work.
- Oh, Christ, they're like dominoes.

130
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,431
Frank, you're not done

131
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,733
- until the end of the day.
- I already cooked the books.

132
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,835
How about you don't cook the
books so we can actually tell

133
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,303
- how the business is doing?
- Oh, well...

134
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,905
It's crazy. How are we ever gonna...

135
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,240
Oh, the soda gun's clogged.

136
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,708
Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?

137
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,343
Trick Charlie into doing it.

138
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,878
Well, I want you to do it.

139
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,045
I can't trick Charlie.

140
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,715
Charlie's pretending to ignore me
because he's jealous of Jerry.

141
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,383
I-I don't want you to trick Charlie.

142
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,718
- I want you to clear the lines.
- Speaking of Jerry...

143
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:48,886
- Break time.
- What do you mean?

144
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,087
Lunch.

145
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,255
I'm craving salty,

146
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,523
but Jerry likes sweet.

147
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,225
What are you doing? Don't-don't
reach your hands directly in the...

148
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,060
- This is sweet.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, get out of here,

149
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,328
Frank, you're an animal.

150
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,830
He won't stop eating,

151
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,098
- yet he's just wasting away.
- Yeah.

152
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,900
I mean, can you believe them?

153
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,468
You know, I can't even play
Night Crawlers with him anymore

154
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,903
'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.

155
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,271
I'm gonna stop you there,
Charlie, because

156
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,714
I've exhausted my daily quota
of worm talk and worm-related issues.

157
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:10,607
- What are you doing?
- Yeah.

158
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,842
- Don't reach your hands in there!
- Why not?

159
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,343
Jesus Christ... Oh, God. Look,

160
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,979
can you just... can you please
go clear the lines for me?

161
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:16,980
Are they clogged?

162
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:17,937
Yeah.

163
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:20,271
- Just trick Dee into it.
- It's not a tri...

164
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,939
See, this is the problem.
You guys all think that work

165
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:24,429
is tricking people. It's not.
It's just your job.

166
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,676
So, can you please go do it?
In all the time

167
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:27,511
that we've talked about tricking
each other into doing our jobs

168
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:28,979
we could've made 1,000 drinks.

169
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,247
Yeah, maybe.

170
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:31,849
All right, let me see if I can
trick Mac into it first.

171
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:34,303
Don't trick anybody, just do it...
Oh, goddamn.

172
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:36,087
I need two shots of whiskey.

173
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:38,289
Two shots of whiskey. Okay, yes, nice.

174
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,267
Finally, somebody's actually working.

175
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:41,835
You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.

176
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,238
- I appreciate you.
- All right, what are you doing?

177
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,906
No, no, no, no, no.

178
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,407
- That was a big one. Thank you.
- The other one, too.

179
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:48,942
Yeah, that's what this is. Okay, so,

180
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,577
clearly, you're not busy,
so, I need somebody

181
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,246
to clear the lines.
The soda gun's clogged.

182
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,615
Did Charlie ask you to trick me?

183
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,383
Trick you? No, the... It's not a trick.

184
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:58,352
The soda gun is clogged,
I cannot make drinks.

185
00:05:58,387 --> 00:05:59,787
I don't know.
I don't trust Charlie today.

186
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,221
You know, I made him a valentine...

187
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:03,190
He hasn't given me shit yet in return.

188
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,959
Why the hell did you do that?
We don't do valentines anymore.

189
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,923
I know, but we used to, and it was fun,
you know? It was a goof.

190
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,648
It wasn't a goof. You guys were
supposed to give valentine's

191
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:12,783
cards to each other, but instead
you were just sticking hate mail

192
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:14,785
in a suggestion box covered in hearts.

193
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,787
I'll give it to you, though...
it got a little nasty at the end.

194
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:18,022
A-A little bit nasty?

195
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:19,657
One of you put anthrax in the box.

196
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,425
Or do you not remember
the anthrax scare?

197
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,627
Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.

198
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,797
To many,
9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.

199
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:28,832
That's a good point.
No, I'm talking about

200
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,601
a different anthrax scare,
but it shouldn't concern you.

201
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,770
- Stop it!
- She just talks too much.

202
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,939
- Hey-oh!
- Oh!

203
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,473
- Cricket!
- Cricket!

204
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,008
- Cricket!
- Hey, you guys mind

205
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,210
if I go in the bathroom
and smoke some PCP?

206
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,579
- No, dude, you do you!
- Go for it.

207
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:42,680
You do you!

208
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,181
- You do you!
- You do you!

209
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:45,816
We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.

210
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,148
What are you doing? Guys, guys, guys,
what in the hell are you doing?

211
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:50,100
- Cricket.
- Cricket.

212
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,022
Yeah, Cricket. This has got to stop,
you guys. This is nuts.

213
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,991
We can't go around
encouraging homeless men

214
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:55,659
to smoke PCP in our restrooms,

215
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,628
you know, trying to trick
each other into doing our jobs

216
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:00,397
and getting fired up at the-the
mere mention of a crate.

217
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,299
- Oh, but it's just such a mystery, isn't it?
- Yeah.

218
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,801
- Cool crate.
- It's a big box.

219
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,402
Yeah, yeah, it really isn't though.
It's just trash.

220
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,404
It's trash that somebody left behind.

221
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,073
Hey, but if it's mystery you want,

222
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,108
you know, what about the
mystery of the yuck puddle?

223
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:13,410
What the hell is that thing, you know?
Why won't it dry up?

224
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,778
Why won't it harden?

225
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,580
It shifts. I've seen it shift.

226
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,749
He's seen it shift.
You see, we shouldn't have

227
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,684
an amorphous shifting blob
in the bar, you know?

228
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,853
So why don't you and Mac go solve

229
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,888
that goddamn mystery
by cleaning it up, you know?

230
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,991
And, oh, what about the mystery
of the clogged soda gun,

231
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,592
you know? Dee, why don't
you and Frank go solve

232
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,828
that mystery by clearing the lines?

233
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:33,030
Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.

234
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,460
And we could probably trick
Cricket into doing it.

235
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,261
Oh, why don't we just trick...

236
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,667
Cricket doesn't work here though.

237
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,002
- But that's free labor.
- Yeah, yeah.

238
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,336
- That's kind of better.
- Get him for free.

239
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,404
You're not... you're not getting...

240
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,739
Hey, just do your jobs!

241
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:43,507
Just do your jobs.

242
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,078
Why isn't it getting any smaller?

243
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:56,431
Can I be honest, dude?
I think this thing's alive.

244
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,145
Oh, that must be what
all the bubbling's about,

245
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,646
'cause it's, like,
trying to communicate.

246
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,561
It definitely feeds.
I-I've found bones in it, man.

247
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:04,596
- So it wants to live.
- Yeah, dude, I don't know

248
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,013
what I'm gonna do during
the next inspection,

249
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,502
'cause I-I can't get rid of this thing.

250
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,669
So Dennis has sent us
in here to do the impossible.

251
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:13,038
Absolutely. Dude, what is
going on with him, right?

252
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:15,674
Like, there's got to be something
in this whole "do your job" angle.

253
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,047
'Cause that doesn't
sound like Dennis to me,

254
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:17,848
- you know what I mean?
- I know, dude.

255
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:20,045
He's acting, like, so weird,
especially towards me.

256
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:21,923
I think it's because I'm gay
and he's, like,

257
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:22,924
- totally uncomfortable with it.
- Y...

258
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:25,517
Well, no, 'cause he's known that
forever, so it's, you know...

259
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,565
Well, he may have suspected it before,
but there's no way

260
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:30,037
he could have known for sure.
'Cause I show no outward signs

261
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:31,780
of being gay, and that's just
the end of the story, all right?

262
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,572
But, look, either way, he's been acting
very distant towards me,

263
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,204
and I feel like he sent me in
here to punish me or something,

264
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:39,972
because, I agree, the whole,
like, "do your job" angle

265
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:42,634
- just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like...
- It's, like, a bullshit thing, right?

266
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,257
- Like...
- Unless... Oh, my God.

267
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:46,040
What?

268
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:49,248
Charlie, he doesn't want us
to work<i> at all.</i>

269
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:51,751
- He doesn't?
- No.

270
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:53,986
He doesn't want us to
mop up the yuck puddle.

271
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:57,957
- He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."
- Oh!

272
00:08:57,992 --> 00:08:59,091
Of emotions.

273
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:00,493
Of what?

274
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,528
- It's a metaphor.
- For what?

275
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:05,464
He wants us to talk through our
personal issues and be more open

276
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,000
with our feelings because
it's Valentine's Day.

277
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:11,570
Oh! Weird. That doesn't
sound like Dennis, but, uh...

278
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:12,767
- Go with me here, dude.
- Okay.

279
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:15,136
Valentine's Day is an entire
day dedicated to feelings,

280
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,110
- something that Dennis doesn't have.
- Right, that's true.

281
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,513
And so that's why he hates
Valentine's Day so much.

282
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:23,182
But he's entrusted me,
because I'm a gay man

283
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,551
- and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,
- Well, no,

284
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:27,653
- to break down those walls.
- but okay. All right.

285
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:29,455
- All right, cool. Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, okay, so I'll share first.

286
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,824
- Okay.
- Okay. I have a huge surprise

287
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,226
for Dennis, but I feel like he's
not emotionally available to...

288
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,696
Uh, uh, Frank's gonna
leave me for Jerry, man.

289
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,265
Oh, uh, I was talking. But, uh,

290
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,867
I guess we'll, um...
we'll do your thing first.

291
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:44,070
You know he's only doing this
to get a rise out of you, right?

292
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,338
- Oh, that's so Jerry.
- No,

293
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:47,740
not Jerry. Not the worm. Never the worm.

294
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,108
We're talking about Frank, okay?

295
00:09:49,143 --> 00:09:51,043
If you just pretend to like the worm,

296
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,712
then he'll probably just get rid of it.

297
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:53,979
Oh, shit. You think so?

298
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,681
I know so, buddy.

299
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:57,928
- Nice, man. All right.
- Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.

300
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,096
- Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.
- If I just give...

301
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:00,532
- Thanks, Mac.
- Charlie, if you just...

302
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,733
You're not gonna let me talk?!

303
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,558
So, uh, you're gay, huh?

304
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:07,727
For pay or for free?

305
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:10,296
Uh, for free, I guess.

306
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:12,531
Chump.

307
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:17,903
It's taking forever.

308
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,181
- Ugh.
- Try sucking on the other end, maybe.

309
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:21,941
I'm not sucking on the other end.
Get that shit in my mouth?

310
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:24,577
No, thanks. And what the hell's
going on with Dennis?

311
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,746
Since when does he
care how the bar does?

312
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,215
I don't know. It doesn't add up.

313
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,351
I can't get a read on him these days.
He's just always cranky and irritated.

314
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,253
- Rage-filled, rape-y.
- It's like,

315
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,188
as the years go by,
he just gets more and more irrational.

316
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:39,125
- Yeah, yeah.
- Especially with this whole "work the bar" angle.

317
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,458
I mean, what is that?

318
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,063
Unless...

319
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,132
Oh, my God.

320
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,034
Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.

321
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,511
- He doesn't?
- No!

322
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,215
He wants us to <i>work</i> on ourselves.

323
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,341
What the shit are you talking about?

324
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,109
Just go with me here.
It's Valentine's Day, right,

325
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:59,145
a day we all used to love
and enjoy until we turned

326
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,980
on each other with the hate mail.

327
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,082
Dennis wants us to work
through our personal issues

328
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:05,117
so we can enjoy Valentine's Day again.

329
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,486
- I got it.
- Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna go first.

330
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:10,656
I'm so mad at Charlie,
because I made him a valentine,

331
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,691
and, you know what,
he didn't even really...

332
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,260
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.

333
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:17,563
Well, I was right in the middle
of a sentence, but... what?

334
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:19,064
I gave myself the tapeworm.

335
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,933
- Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've...
- How, you're wondering.

336
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,401
No, I don't. No, thanks.

337
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:23,602
I bought poop on the dark Web

338
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:25,304
and stuffed it up my
butt to lose weight.

339
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,872
- Jesus Christ. Uh, that's enough.
- Yeah.

340
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,507
- Well, it took about four ounces of it.
- I-I...

341
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,475
That's enough! I don't want to know!

342
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,409
With the tip of a teaspoon.

343
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:31,911
- Okay... Frank!
- How else?

344
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,346
Stop answering questions
I'm not asking, okay?

345
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:35,524
- I'm done, I'm done.
- I had to hold my knees

346
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:36,725
above my head for a half hour

347
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,184
- and clench my sphincter.
- Stop! Stop!

348
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:48,163
Charlie, I'm mad,

349
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:49,664
- and I think we need to clear the lines.
- Huh?

350
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:53,002
- Uh, just-just trick somebody else into it.
- No, that's not what I'm...

351
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,704
Wh-What are you doing?

352
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm trying to write a valentine.
I just...

353
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,543
Oh. Okay.

354
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:03,279
Uh, okay.
Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish.

355
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:04,747
- Didn't mean to interrupt.
- Okay.

356
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:06,916
I also got you
a box of chocolates, so...

357
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:08,584
Right.

358
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,852
Oh, oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Dee, Dee, Dee.

359
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,754
- Yeah.
- Um, c-can you think

360
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,056
of a word that rhymes with "Jerry"?

361
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,959
- What?
- I can't think of one.

362
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,462
Are you making a valentine
for Frank's tapeworm?

363
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:22,031
Well, not if I can't think of a
word that rhymes with "Jerry."

364
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,900
- You son of a bitch.
- What?

365
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,135
- I can't believe you don't know!
- I have no idea!

366
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,671
Oh, and literally everything
rhymes with "Jerry," okay?

367
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,630
Scary, hairy, Mother Mary,
quite contrary.

368
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:34,544
Woozy, woozy. Woozy from sucking lines.

369
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,661
- Ho.
- All right, Frank, Frank, Frank,

370
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,262
before you do another thing,

371
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,950
- I wanted to give you a valentine.
- Unbelievable!

372
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,170
Right in front of me?

373
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:43,471
- You did?
- Yeah-huh.

374
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,122
- Charlie. Well...
- Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,

375
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:49,135
- these are just for Jerry.
- No.

376
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,960
- Charlie. Oh.
- Yeah.

377
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,070
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Look at that.

378
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:53,871
- Thank...
- You dick.

379
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,299
- You shouldn't have. Mmm.
- No! No, he didn't.

380
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:57,833
Listen to me, I got these
for him, all right?

381
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,534
- So no.
- Mmm?

382
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,869
- I got these.
- Our blood sugar's low. Mmm.

383
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,672
- Oh, guess what, I bought these for him.
- Mmm...

384
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:05,875
You fool!

385
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,977
- It's so good, Charlie.
- Those chocolates

386
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,313
that you're so gleefully devouring

387
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:14,216
are chock-full of Bye-Bye Jerry pills.

388
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:17,620
You wouldn't.

389
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,322
Oh, but I would, Frank.

390
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,857
You see, I knew you'd never
take the pills willingly.

391
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,292
But Jerry...

392
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,394
Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?

393
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,126
You poisoned me.

394
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,865
No. No, he poisoned me.

395
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,199
At worst, you're properly medicated.

396
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:32,268
You son of a bitch.

397
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,305
- Charlie.
- Bye-bye... Jerry!

398
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,789
I'm poisoned.

399
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:37,090
Poisoned! I'm poisoned.

400
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:37,991
What are you doing?

401
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,526
- We've been poisoned.
- No, No.

402
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:40,694
No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned.

403
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:41,995
- They're just...
- Plenty more poison

404
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,096
where that came from!

405
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:44,531
- Uh, there is no...
- So, don't even think

406
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,832
about trying to get another worm, Frank.

407
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,000
And there are no-no worms.

408
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,536
- Nobody has worms.
- Well, not anymore they don't.

409
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,137
Don't leave. Please, don't leave.

410
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,372
Guys, what are you doing?

411
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,640
Take this discussion someplace else.

412
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:56,109
No, I'm good because I've
had a great Valentine's Day.

413
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,143
Bye-bye, Jerry.

414
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,211
Are you serious?!

415
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:00,714
You son of a bitch, Charlie.
You screwed me, okay?!

416
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:01,781
- What are you talking about?
- You know what...

417
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,383
screw you, Charlie!

418
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:05,618
I'm not gonna let some worm
beat me on Valentine's Day.

419
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:06,853
- Don't talk about...
- Why are you going on and on about it?

420
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,688
I... I did this for you, Charlie.

421
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:09,756
What?

422
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,558
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.

423
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:12,892
Why would you do that?

424
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,594
To slim down for you.

425
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,063
Why would you...
why would you slim down for me? What?

426
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,898
Because I overheard you
on the phone saying,

427
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,633
"He got flabby."

428
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,736
No, no, no, buddy.
I never said that.

429
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:26,373
I sa... I-I-I said you were crabby
because you smelled crabby...

430
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,676
'cause you've been eating
all those sewer crabs, man, but..

431
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:31,311
- Take it outside.
- It was a compliment. I love when you

432
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:34,381
- smell like crab, Frank.
- Take the conversation someplace else.

433
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,882
Okay? Don't do it here.

434
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,150
You-you didn't think I was too fat?

435
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:40,920
Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal,
but I loved you that way, Frank.

436
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,322
Fat and crabby.

437
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:44,824
So, you want to try and get
this dead worm out of me?

438
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,925
I would love to pull
that dead worm out of you.

439
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,694
Yeah?! Come on.
Come on, now oh...

440
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:49,866
Stop, stop! Goddamn it, stop.
What are you guys doing?

441
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:50,744
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

442
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,165
- Getting the worm.
- You-you're gonna talk

443
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
about pulling a dead
worm out of his ass?

444
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,301
Don't do that. Please,
don't talk about these things.

445
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:57,871
Now, by the grace of God,
we somehow still have Dottie here

446
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:59,272
so, please, don't scare her away.

447
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:00,273
Sorry, Dottie.

448
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,308
- Who's ready to die, bitches?!
- Dee...

449
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:03,168
- Whoa!
- No.

450
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,169
What are you doing
with the Valentine's box?

451
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,112
- Put that down.
- All right, just think

452
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,280
about what you're doing, Dee.

453
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:08,581
I know exactly what I'm doing.

454
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,816
Okay, okay, fine.
Dee, just don't mention...

455
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,751
- I am busting out the anthrax.
- No!

456
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,586
- And I'm out.
- Dottie, no.

457
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:14,521
No, you don't have to go.

458
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:15,688
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Charlie.

459
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:19,492
I'm getting a goddamn valentine
right goddamn now, or so help me God...

460
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:20,860
I will end us all.

461
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,228
No, don't.
Give the bitch what she wants.

462
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:23,730
- I will...
- I'm so frustrated right now.

463
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,798
Okay, fine, Dee.
You know what I'm gonna do?

464
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,932
I'm gonna sing you a song.

465
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,434
Okay? A Valentine's Day song?

466
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,401
All right? Is that... will that work?

467
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,336
- Fine. Sing a song.
- Okay.

468
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,639
Uh... a Dee song.

469
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:36,389
- Nothing rhymes with Dee.
- Every...!

470
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:38,244
Everything rhymes with Dee.

471
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,579
- I mean, literally, everything rhymes...
- Okay.

472
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:40,747
Okay, fine. I'll-I'll think of things.

473
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:42,682
Okay, j-j-just relax. Uh, uh...

474
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:43,983
♪ Dee... ♪

475

476
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,688

477
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:49,856
Right? I didn't think of that.

478
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,157

479
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:54,127

What's a pound carrot?

483
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:02,735
Go with pound cake.

Thanks, Charlie.

491
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,331
You can't rhyme very well, but...

492
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,434
That was...

493
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:36,336
that was really...

494
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,238
really pathetic.

495
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,468
What?

496
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:44,377
I wrote a couple words
on a construction paper,

497
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:47,447
pink and red, and you sing
a heart song for me?!

498
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,716
You made me do it!

499
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:51,818
Yeah! And you said you loved me!

500
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:54,020
- Ew!
- You bitch!

501
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,388
Look, that song was
derivative of a song I wrote

502
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:56,723
- for the waitress, anyway, then.
- Yeah, but guess what?

503
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:57,790
Frank, grab that anthrax!

504
00:16:57,826 --> 00:16:59,025
Grab it! Grab it!

505
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,026
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

506
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,761
Stop! Stop! Stop.

507
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,897
What are you...
what are you guys doing?!

508
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,698
All right, this is nuts! This is crazy!

509
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,601
I mean, I-I-I can't believe
we blew another opportunity

510
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:10,036
to have a working bar.

511
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,438
To have a successful business together!

512
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,041
Because you assholes get so
worked up over Valentine's Day,

513
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,076
the dumbest holiday that ever existed!

514
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:19,112
But I thought you were
trying to get us to focus

515
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,547
on ourselves and focus
on Valentine's Day.

516
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,714
What?!

517
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,383
Are-are you insane?!

518
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,187
I... All I've been saying is
to please focus on the bar!

519
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:28,688
But you just couldn't do it!

520
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,390
Dennis, I got to say,
I feel like this is

521
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,324
just about something else.

522
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,993
It's... It's not about
something else, it's...

523
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,628
- The bar is fine.
- Yup.

524
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,930
- This is... something else is up.
- It's always fine, yeah.

525
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:38,498
You know what it is?

526
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,400
- This is 'cause you hate Valentine's Day.
- It's not because

527
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,601
I hate Valentine's Day.

528
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:42,902
- It's because I-I just want...
- No, that's what it is.

529
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,771
- He's trying to distract us from Valentine's Day.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:47,006
- That's it.
- I'm not trying to distract anybody from Valen...

531
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,641
- Yeah, you know why, though, you guys?
- That's the thing, yeah.

532
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,410
It's because he doesn't
have any feelings and we do.

533
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,911
Yeah, because we have feelings
and you don't,

534
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,713
and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.

535
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:55,715
Oh, stop! Goddamn it!

536
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,053
I hate Valentine's Day because
you assholes never got me anything!

537
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:03,289
Okay, and I have feelings!

538
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:04,457
Of course I have feelings!

539
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,226
I have big feelings, okay?!

540
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:07,860
A-and it hurts.

541
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,029
Okay, so...

542
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,432
so... that's why I hate Valentine's Day,

543
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,335
and that's why I put anthrax in the box.

544
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,736
That was you?

545
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,404
Yes, it was me.

546
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,427
I just...

547
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,840
I just wanted it to stop.

548
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,773
Okay? And it's powdered sugar,
by the way.

549
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,011
- Oh, he's already eating it.
- I knew that.

550
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,213
Dennis.

551
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,414
What?!

552
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,482
I got the crate.

553
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:30,550
So what?!

554
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:31,517
Open it.

555
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,720
I'm not gonna open a goddamn crate, Mac!

556
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:34,887
There's nothing in it!

557
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:36,122
Just open it.

558
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,690
You want me to open the crate?
I'll open the goddamn crate.

559
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,325
If it'll get you to stop
focusing on it and get you

560
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,628
to stop focusing on this goddamn
Valentine's Day bullshit.

561
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,564
I don't know why you're so excited
about this goddamn thing.

562
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,532
There's never anything insi...

563
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,438
What is this?

564
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,473
It's a gift.

565
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,174
I got it for you.

566
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,409
For me?

567
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:57,644
Yeah.

568
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,712
You, uh...

569
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,818
You got this for me?

570
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,820
I ordered it off the dark Web.

571
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,522
I wanted it to be a surprise.

572
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:12,859
Yeah.

573
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,623
And how did you, um...

574
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:19,499
How did you know that I wanted an RPG?

575
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,034
'Cause I know you, man.

576
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:24,737
Also, you casually mention RPGs,
like, a weird amount.

577
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:26,906
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

578
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,541
- You were talking about rocket launchers today,
- Yeah, you talk about them.

579
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:30,243
- I think, yeah.
- That was today.

580
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,947
This is, uh...

581
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,283
this is cool.

582
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,787
I still think Valentine's Day is
a bullshit holiday, but, um...

583
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,023
...this is nice.

584
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:46,859
Want to shoot it?

585
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,060
Yes.

586
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:51,431
Where's the rocket?

587
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,999
Yeah, that should be,

588
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:55,768
uh... shit, I... there's no rocket.

589
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,136
- No rocket in there?
- There's no rocket?

590
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,438
Ah, there's no rocket!

591
00:19:58,473 --> 00:19:59,639
They forgot to put the rocket in there!

592
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:00,940
Dude, I'm so sorry!

593
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:03,309
Mac, I don't care.

594
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:04,577
I love it.

595
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:08,381
You figured out the one thing
I wanted more than anything else

596
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,415
in the entire world
and you got it for me.

597
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,184
And...

598
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,287
...it's perfect.

599
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:16,022
Happy Valentine's Day.

600
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:18,758
Yeah.

601
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,428
Charlie, let's go get
this worm out of my ass.

602
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:24,230
- Let's do it, man. All right.
- Okay.
