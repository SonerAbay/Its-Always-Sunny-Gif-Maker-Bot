2
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:42,441
We think it's a sinkhole! It's awesome!

3
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,780
- It's not that awesome.
- It's blowing my mind!

4
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,944
How is a hole in the ground
blowing your mind?

5
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,783
I was a little skeptical at first too...

6
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,323
but we've been playing with this thing for
three hours now, and it's fantastic.

7
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,450
Can I ask,
how do you play with a goddamn hole?

8
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:56,655
First, we started just, like, throwing things
down it, and then we never heard it land.

9
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,391
It would just kind of
rattle around down there.

10
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,660
Then we got a flashlight
to see if we could see the bottom.

11
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,827
We couldn't.
Then I threw it down there to prove a point.

12
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,734
- What was the point?
- It was something to do...

13
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,831
with how metal travels faster than light or...

14
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:12,174
No, it was that light is either on or off.
There's no speed to light.

15
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,769
It's... It was an antiscience thing.

16
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,872
This hole, it's very exciting, Dennis.

17
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:18,747
I mean, it represents
infinite possibilities. It's endless.

18
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,309
What if there's a mutant living down there?

19
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:22,514
We can get him up.
He can live in the bar with us.

20
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,217
We've already got one mutant
hanging out with us in the bar all the time.

21
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:29,522
Hey, Frank,
did you hear what I said?

22
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,860
I turned a frustrating conversation
into a joke on you.

23
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:35,424
- The, uh... thing.
- Huh? Oh, y-yeah.

24
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,868
Frank, what do you think about this hole?
Pretty cool, huh?

25
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,907
- You want to do something with it?
- No. I don't.

26
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,534
In fact,
something just dawned on me.

27
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,100
I need to quit.

28
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:47,339
What... What? What are...
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:49,439
I don't care anything about this hole.

30
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,279
I-I-I'm passionless.

31
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,012
What are you saying, Frank?

32
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:57,182
I hereby officially retire from Paddy's Pub.

33
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,731
Yeah!

34
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,217
All right, now, with Frank retiring...

35
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,418
I know we're all a little bit concerned
about how that affects everyone's shares.

36
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,951
Frank owned 51%
of Paddy's Pub, and we owned 46%.

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,520
Well, we did, not... not Dee.

38
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,088
She doesn't own shit.

39
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,066
- Yeah, I know. Goddamn it.
- Yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,365
And, Charlie, you actually
gave up most of your shares...

41
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,405
for various sandwiches
and snacks and sundries and things.

42
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:47,963
What the hell is a Franquito?

43
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,509
It says Franquito
owns three percent of Paddy's Pub?

44
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:53,603
Oh, yeah. I don't know. That's probably one
of Frank's weird shell corporations.

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,910
It doesn't matter.
Who gives a shit? It's only three percent.

46
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,849
Whoever gets Frank's 51%
is the majority shareholder.

47
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,083
That is who controls the bar.
That is who gets the throne.

48
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:05,386
Oh, there's a throne?

49
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,120
Oh, sorry. No, I was just
referring to the desk chair as the throne...

50
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:09,684
'cause that's where the boss man sits.

51
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,788
Gross.
That chair smells like Frank's butt.

52
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:15,096
It's not actually Frank's butt. I think it's
a combination of all of our butt smells.

53
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:16,362
- That's worse.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:17,926
Why would anybody want that chair?

55
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,494
No, no, it's not about the chair itself.

56
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,133
- It's what the chair represents.
The chair represents power. - Mmm.

57
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,938
Okay, well, all right.
How do we divvy up Frank's shares then?

58
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:28,572
Uh...
Okay, well, um...

59
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,206
I'll-I'll take 'em.

60
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,114
You? You?
You think we're gonna give the shares...

61
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,746
to the man who wants to pull a mutant from a
mystery hole in the bar and live with him?

62
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,653
Look, I'm just trying
to come up with a system.

63
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:40,215
- We got to have a system here...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

64
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,421
We do have a system for
this. Paddy's succession plan, remember?

65
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,555
Oh, shit! Right. Yes, right!

66
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,122
Paddy's succession plan.

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,828
It was like a will that we drew up
to help us determine...

68
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,666
who would get each one of our shares...

69
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:54,263
- in the very likely event of our untimely deaths.
- That's right.

70
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,002
We drank, like, three bottles of tequila...

71
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:58,772
and then we started talking about our legacy
and how important that was to us.

72
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,335
Oh! Got to have a legacy.

73
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,244
- Oh, here we go.
- Oh, oh! Yeah, okay.

74
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,215
- On a paper plate, huh?
- Read it! Read it!

75
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,617
"Paddy's succession plan.
Paddy's Pub shall secure our legacy here...

76
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:11,282
henceforth and forevermore, throughout the
birthright of our firstborn kin."

77
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:13,826
- Who had the pen here?
- It makes sense. Don't be a bitch.

78
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:18,159
What it means is every one of our shares
gets passed down to our firstborn.

79
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,256
Right, right! Our firstborn!

80
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,563
- The shares get passed down
to the firstborn kin? - Yeah.

81
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,297
We are the firstborn kin of Frank.

82
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:27,306
Well, now, hang on.
That's not, like, an official document.

83
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:29,035
Uh, well, you signed it in your blood.

84
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,339
Oh, that... Yeah, there it is...
"Trundle," written in blood.

85
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,504
Oh, yeah, I was going
by Trundle at the time, wasn't I?

86
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,048
No, no, no. You were trying
to write "Charlie" and you wrote "Trundle."

87
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,606
No, I was going by Trundle the Great.

88
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:39,208
You came up with that after you miswrote it.

89
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,812
Look, the point is you can't just take the
bar based on a paper plate.

90
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,379
Sorry, Charlie.

91
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:47,722
I'm siding with Dennis and Dee.
I'm your humble servant.

92
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:49,318
You're just gonna give it to them?

93
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:51,455
That's a binding contract, okay?
You wrote it in blood.

94
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,500
That's gonna hold up in a court of law and
I know when to pick a side.

95
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,127
- I'm siding with Dennis and Dee.
- Wait, hold on a second.

96
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,569
You guys aren't even actually Frank's kid.

97
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,402
You're Bruce Mathis's kid, all right?

98
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,533
And I technically might be Frank's kid.

99
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,375
Charlie, I pledge my allegiance to you.

100
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,005
No, no, no, no. Wait a second, no.

101
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,550
- But Frank is a Reynolds, and <i>we</i> are Reynolds.
- Yep, we're Reynolds.

102
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:15,850
Yeah, and it's the name that carries on the
line, not maybe being someone's bastard kid.

103
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,417
It was always you guys.
I tricked him. It was always you.

104
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,892
It is the blood that binds.

105
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:25,761
And his blood is pumping through my veins.
And I shall prove it.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,934
This is a little bit harder...

107
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:32,062
because he might win 'cause he had some
good points, but you guys might win...

108
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,231
- We don't give a shit about what you're
talking about! - It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,639
Hey-o! There's my guy!

110
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,878
Hey, I got a piping hot
grilled Frank for you, okay?

111
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,681
I got the sausage, the Spam, the bacon.

112
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:50,552
I got it wrapped in a jelly pancake and
cooked with a stick of butter.

113
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,284
I don't want that, Charlie.

114
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,848
I'm trying to get in shape.

115
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,918
I read all about this phenomenon...

116
00:06:55,995 --> 00:07:01,092
that guys' bodies immediately turn to shit
the second they retire.

117
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,067
- Oh, yeah?
- I got to work on it.

118
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:06,071
All right, well, you know,
just-just take a peek, see if you like it.

119
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,370
- Uh, hey, listen, man, can I ask you something?
- What?

120
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,808
Are you, like, um...

121
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,368
my dad?

122
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,572
What?

123
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,275
Are, like...
Are you the father of me and shit?

124
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,840
- We've been over this.
- Yeah.

125
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,476
- Your mother's a giant whore.
- Right.

126
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,044
I don't want to stress about this, Charlie.
I'm retired.

127
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,182
Leave me alone.
I want to watch a little TV.

128
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,748
- Yeah. All right.
- Charlie, hey...

129
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,623
Oh. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

130
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,185
Uh, yeah. Hey.

131
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:34,097
- Hey, um, I came up with a
really great idea, dude. - Yeah?

132
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,965
I'm gonna play both sides.

133
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:40,233
- Why would you tell <i>me</i> that?
- Should I not have?

134
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:43,002
Probably shouldn't 'cause if you're trying
to keep a secret from me, now I know.

135
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,634
I should've... Should I tell them?

136
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:46,576
No, I don't think
you should tell either side...

137
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,615
'cause if you're trying to play both sides and
they both know, you're not playing anybody.

138
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,674
- What should I do now?
- I don't give a shit. Why are you here?

139
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,586
I'm here to prove my allegiance to you
because I believe that you're the rightful heir.

140
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:59,784
- Okay, whatever.
- All right, well, I see that you don't believe me.

141
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,327
- Why would I?
- So I am prepared to take a blood oath with you.

142
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,488
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

143
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,054
- Oh, my God, dude!
- Oh, God.

144
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,498
- Oh, that was Frank's toe knife!
- Oh, it hurts so much.

145
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,433
- Quick, shake on it.
- No, I'm not gonna touch your blood.

146
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,334
Do you have something I could...
I gotta close this wound.

147
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,999
- Plug it up. - That was not as
cool as I thought it was gonna be.

148
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,974
That sock's probably gonna
get it more infected though.

149
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,238
All right, look, look,
look, look, look, look, look, dude.

150
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,076
- We gotta prove that Frank is your dad.
- I know.

151
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,673
- That makes you the rightful... - He doesn't
want to have that conversation with me.

152
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,378
He's certainly not gonna get tested,
you know?

153
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:28,010
He's really resistant to the whole thing.

154
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,954
All right, then we're gonna have
to do some testing of our own.

155
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:34,323
- Yeah?
- I can choke a man out in four seconds flat.

156
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:37,192
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I guess
we could try that or, uh...

157
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:38,753
Yeah. All right.

158
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:42,199
You know, we could probably
take his blood right now. He's out.

159
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:43,758
He's staring right at us.

160
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,998
Yeah, he's been falling
asleep with his eyes open like that.

161
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,802
But he's way out. I mean, we could prick
him. He won't feel a thing.

162
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,399
Frank!

163
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,847
- Anything?
- Nothing!

164
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,148
Not a single butt smell to that.
How is that possible?

165
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,553
I don't know. It's either this guy's butt
or this brand of chair.

166
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:06,717
- It's got to be the brand, right?
- We got to get one of these for our throne.

167
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:09,455
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey!
- Hey! Hey, what do you say, Doc?

168
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,488
So, what is the verdict?
Is Frank Charlie's dad or not?

169
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,227
I don't know. I don't know who that is.

170
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,235
What I do know is I came
to work this morning...

171
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,271
to find a very large
bucket of blood in my lab.

172
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,933
Yeah, well, that's the sample, obviously,
and, uh, you know...

173
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,772
if it's too big, it's 'cause Frank sprung a
little bit of a leak there.

174
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,074
- Yeah, it was a mess, huh?
- He was bleeding like crazy.

175
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,341
There was blood everywhere.
But we caught enough of it.

176
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,474
- Yeah, we must have caught a deep
vein or something. - I think.

177
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,576
Wait a second.
Most of this came from one man?

178
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:36,213
- Did we take too much? I didn't
think we took too much. - Nah.

179
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,018
Yes. You took too much.

180
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:42,460
Also, there's traces of more than four individuals
in here, and at least one animal.

181
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:43,620
Ah, shit.

182
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,721
Was there blood in the bucket before?

183
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,323
It <i>is</i> a blood bucket,
so, yeah, there was <i>old</i> blood.

184
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,232
I didn't come here to get sassed, okay?

185
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,134
I came here to get an answer to my question.

186
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,934
So is Frank Charlie's dad or not?

187
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,804
The only thing that
I can tell you is that...

188
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,672
based off of how much
blood is in this bucket...

189
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:00,212
your friend is in desperate need of blood.

190
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:05,212
All right, Dee, the bar is finally ours.

191
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,809
Let's talk redecoration.

192
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,980
- Well, I'm thinking chrome, and I'm
thinking chrome everywhere. - Hmm.

193
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:12,581
The other thing that's important to me
is a proper dance floor.

194
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,117
That way, any time I want to just pop a
boogie, I can do it wherever I am...

195
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,220
and it won't be weird, you know what I mean?

196
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,698
- Okay.
- Oh, think of it, brother.

197
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,736
With them out of the way,
we can do as we please.

198
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:27,398
Two butts, one throne.

199
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:30,169
You know what, you've been doing this all
day. Why are you talking like that?

200
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,609
- I'm just being... I'm being arch.
- Why?

201
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,510
Well, because we're being
devious and we're plotting...

202
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,947
and I just wanted to make sure that it was
clear that we were devious and plotting.

203
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,781
You don't need to indicate to me that you're being
devious when you're actually being devious.

204
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:44,584
I guess I had some concerns that you wouldn't
pick up on it if I didn't make it super clear.

205
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,887
But if you start doing that,
everybody's gonna pick up on it.

206
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,484
- And that defeats the purpose.
- Yeah, got it.

207
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,359
Dennis, Dee, quickly.
We don't have much time.

208
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:55,424
Charlie and I doctored a paternity test to
make it look like Frank is Charlie's dad.

209
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,028
But the tests were actually inconclusive.
There was too much blood in the bucket to tell.

210
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:02,438
The reason I'm telling you all this is
because I'm playing both sides...

211
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,567
so that I always come out on top.

212
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,942
So, with this information,
I'm gonna leverage you guys...

213
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:10,505
into making me the head of security
at the new Paddy's Pub.

214
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,246
Okay, okay, couple things right off the bat
there, pal. Number one, um...

215
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,652
- never tell one side that you're
playing both sides. - Yeah.

216
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:19,590
And number two, if you are
gonna play both sides...

217
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,651
don't give away the information before
you get what you want.

218
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:24,356
Oh, shit.

219
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,762
- Right. <i>Don't</i> give away the information.
- Yeah.

220
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,358
All right. If I am gonna play both sides,
what should I do?

221
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,960
You're still telling us that you're playing
both sides, so why would we help you?

222
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:35,701
Uh... Okay, well, what if I make a blood
allegiance to you guys?

223
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,572
- Oh! Gross.
- Ooh.

224
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:40,771
Yeah, I, uh... I sliced it
with Frank's toe knife and, uh...

225
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,872
It's not bleeding anymore,
but maybe I could...

226
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,507
- Oh, yeah, here. I'll just get it again.
- Oh.

227
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,313
Oh, shit!

228
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:48,877
- Oh, God!
- Jesus, dude, that was the lime knife.

229
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:52,823
- Oh, I feel that... It stings. Oh, Dee, here,
shake my... - No, get away from me. Gross.

230
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,553
- Ah, Dennis?
- No, your blood is disgusting.

231
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:57,061
- What should I do?
- Go to the doctor.

232
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,997
- Mac, why the hell did you sprint ahead of
me, man? - 'Cause I'm playing both sides.

233
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,693
- Jesus Christ.
- Wow.

234
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,998
Well, it doesn't matter.
Okay, guys, I got some documentation here...

235
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,231
proving that I am the rightful heir
to Frank's butt chair.

236
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,000
- Yeah.
- All right, Charlie, save it. Save it.

237
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:10,542
Mac already told us that that's not
a real paternity test.

238
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,374
What the hell, dude?
You swore a blood oath to me.

239
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,505
Dude, you never touched my blood, okay?

240
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,811
All right, you know what,
if you really want to work here...

241
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,545
- kick Charlie out of here.
- Hmm.

242
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,780
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:25,346
No problem, dude.
Charlie, let's go, bud. Get...

244
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:28,053
All right, dude, I'm gonna carry you out.

245
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:30,823
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God, he is so heavy.

246
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,728
He's, like,
grounding himself with something.

247
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,233
Oh, now he's going limp.
No, come on, dude. That's not fair.

248
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,633
Help me out here, Charlie. Help me out.

249
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,568
That's it, dude.
That's it. I'm choking you out.

250
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,732
- Okay.
- You're going out, dude. You're going to sleep.

251
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:44,333
Good night, dude. Good night, bitch.

252
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,917
Your head of security
just choked himself out.

253
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,286
Hey, Frank, I know
you're trying to be healthy...

254
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,294
so I got you a hoagie
with extra pickles in it.

255
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,954
I figured you could use
the veggies and stuff...

256
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:08,159
- Oh, shit!
- Hi, Charlie.

257
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,662
What's going on with you, man?

258
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:12,727
I forgot to dye my hair this morning.

259
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:14,432
What's up with your teeth?

260
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:17,567
I was eating some of Deandra's
pyramid scheme berries...

261
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,235
to try to get healthy.

262
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,076
- Right.
- I feel a little light-headed.

263
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,207
All right, well,
I'm sure it's nothing, you know.

264
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:26,911
Probably just, like,
tired from working hard and then...

265
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:29,784
You know, the body crashes when... 0h, shit,
did you fall asleep again?

266
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,423
Frank?

267
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:33,982
- Is he dead?
- Oh, shit.

268
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,960
- He looks bad.
- What are you sneaking up on me for?

269
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,962
Listen.
Dennis is acting weird and I don't like it.

270
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,191
Now I know he's got something planned,
but he's not indicating...

271
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:41,756
so I don't know what it is.

272
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,859
Right. No, I get that, I guess, so...

273
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,394
Yes, yes, exactly,
Charlie. So here's the plan...

274
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:51,341
- We need to outsmart him before he can
have us murdered... - Are you okay?

275
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,707
And throw us in... Hmm?

276
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,268
Do you need a glass of water or something?

277
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,107
- No, I'm good.
- What's happening?

278
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,208
- I'm... I'm being arch.
- Oh.

279
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,684
We're doing a thing together,
so you know...

280
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,880
Yeah, no, I know,
just 'cause you're telling me what's up.

281
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:06,220
Okay, okay, fine. The point is we gotta prove
that you're the rightful heir to the throne.

282
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,884
Of course.
That's why I got this plastic bag...

283
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,450
'cause my blood bucket was inconclusive.

284
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,292
- You just need a couple drops.
- Right, yeah.

285
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,298
- So let's open him up.
- Yeah, all right. But, you know...

286
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:15,926
we gotta be careful 'cause I think I took
too much blood last time.

287
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,492
- Is that what's going on?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,060
Okay, you just need a couple drops.

289
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,197
- All right, just a prick. Just a little prick.
- Just a prick.

290
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:23,435
- Oh! It's a tremendous amount of blood.
- Dear God, so much blood!

291
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,568
So much blood!
I think we hit an artery. Look at this.

292
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,135
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

293
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,306
- Is he okay?
- No, he's okay. The duct tape'll stop it.

294
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,646
Okay, let's just get...
Wait. Oh, shit, this is leaking.

295
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,412
Oh, no. Oh, shit, here...

296
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,215
- Stop, stop!
- Aaah!

297
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,688
- Oh, damn it.
- Shoot, Charlie, I'm sorry. I was trying to help.

298
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:39,622
Can't imagine it was gonna be
a very good sample anyway.

299
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,387
There are quite a few pickles
floating around in that bag.

300
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,291
- Yeah, let's think.
- Shit.

301
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,853
Wait a second...
Which one of you and Dennis was firstborn?

302
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,763
- We're twins.
- No, I know, I know, but, like...

303
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,562
who did Barbara actually,
like, pop out first?

304
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:51,193
Oh, shit.

305
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,703
Oh, Charlie.

306
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,070
- "Worst is first!"
- What is that?

307
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,609
"Worst is first." My mom used to say that to
me all the time...

308
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,668
because I was first
and she thought I was the worst.

309
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:02,179
- Holy shit, that's terrible, but that's good for us.
- Yeah!

310
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:04,443
- Yeah! - So that means you're the
rightful heir to the butt chair.

311
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,246
So, all right, we can work with that.

312
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,752
Let's get out of here. Come on.

313
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,310
- We can't tell anybody about this, all right?
- Okay.

314
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:10,878
- All right, let's just go.
- Let's just leave it.

315
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:18,721
I've always hated these.
So that's gonna change.

316
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,733
Worst is first, dude. Worst is first.

317
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,234
What are you talking about, man?

318
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,896
Dee is conspiring against you.

319
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:29,066
Charlie figured it out. Worst is first.

320
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:32,668
Charlie and Dee were getting blood from
Frank when Charlie realized...

321
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,736
Dee was born first.

322
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,304
Therefore, she's the rightful heir.

323
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:38,907
Then I got a little bit more
blood from Frank, 'cause I feel like...

324
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:42,216
we're probably gonna use it in the future and
he was already opened up, so who gives a shit?

325
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,222
Okay, all right.
How'd you get all this information?

326
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,417
I was hiding in Frank's apartment...

327
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:49,552
and then they went out into the hallway and
I heard them through the door.

328
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,063
Dude, the best part
is I'm gonna use this information...

329
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,964
to leverage you into giving me a better
position under your reign.

330
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:57,093
You just told me the inform...

331
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:58,830
You know what?
Forget it. Good job.

332
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:01,566
Um, how about the position of my pawn?
How's that sound?

333
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,940
Pawn. Pawns are cool. There's a lot of them,
you know. They move diagonally.

334
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:07,639
I've always thought that I move a little bit
too much forward and back...

335
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,442
and I should be more like... like...

336
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:13,007
'Cause then you can't see me if I'm coming
at you like this. Like, sideways.

337
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,417
Well, watch.
Well, don't move your head, dude.

338
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,456
What if you keep your head there
but close your eyes...

339
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,583
You know what, it doesn't matter. I need you
to do something for me.

340
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:31,397
Oh. Oh, my God. That is crazy.

341
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,301
It's the smell of a thousand butts.

342
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,533
Hey! Dennis! Dennis, I did your bidding.

343
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,269
- Good.
- Yeah.

344
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,004
Frank is on his way.

345
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,479
But, dude, whatever it is you got planned,
you better do it fast...

346
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,812
because if Dee and Charlie
get that birth certificate, you're screwed.

347
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,182
Look, Mac, I told you,
I've got it under control.

348
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:50,120
- Everything is going according to my plan.
- Right.

349
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:53,022
Worst is first! Worst is first!

350
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,492
- -  Oh, Brother,
looks as though you've underes...

351
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,392
- Stop doing that. It doesn't work.
- No?

352
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,761
Look, we found the birth certificate
proving Dee was born first.

353
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,459
- Worst is first.
- Worst is first.

354
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:04,503
Yeah, and then Charlie and I, we made a
blood oath, so now we're in cahoots.

355
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,162
- Yeah!
- Trundle, can I get in on that?

356
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,206
- I'm on their side.
- Nasty.

357
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,765
You idiots. Did you not think that
I had anticipated this?

358
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:14,176
While you were running around town like
lunatics, chopping your hands to bits...

359
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:15,941
I did a little bit of research.

360
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:18,848
Turns out Franquito
isn't a shell corporation after all.

361
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,408
He's a person.

362
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:24,081
Dee, you remember Josefina, our maid
from the early '80s?

363
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:25,418
Yeah.

364
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,550
Well, turns out Frank
had been banging her for years...

365
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:30,720
and just before we were born, he was.

366
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:31,956
Franquito!

367
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,555
<i>¡Ven acàl</i>

368
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,724
Holy shit!

369
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:38,064
- Whoa!
- What?

370
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,764
Yeah, look upon him.

371
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,569
Yeah, he doesn't speak any English, by the
way, so don't try talking to him.

372
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,131
But we worked something out.

373
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,576
Yeah, Frank's shares go to him,
'cause he's the firstborn...

374
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,636
and then Franquito signs to me.

375
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,978
It's game, set and match.

376
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,952
Holy shit.

377
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,556
What is happening right now?

378
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:02,355
I'm not... I'm not feeling so well.

379
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,589
Retirement is difficult.

380
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,990
Anyway... Hey, Frank!

381
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,968
Guess who this is.
Haven't seen him in a while, have you?

382
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:14,962
Come closer.

383
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,531
It's your son.

384
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:19,901
Franquito.

385
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:27,518
Yes. Of course it is.

386
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,451
Look how beautiful he is.

387
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,123
Oh!
My one true child. Come closer.

388
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:41,259
Oh! You give me so much joy right now.

389
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,824
And, so, Frank, the bar shall go to him.

390
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:45,996
- Oh!
- Just need you to sign here and here.

391
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:50,007
When a man is no longer
needed in the tribe...

392
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,339
his body betrays him.

393
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:53,400
Yeah.

394
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,947
When he has no purpose...

395
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:59,109
the blood seems to drain from his body...

396
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:02,746
leaving him a shell of the man he once was.

397
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:05,347
All right, I don't know where you're going
with this, but can you just sign?

398
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:07,517
- I'm unretiring.
- Wh-What?

399
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:09,083
I have a plan.

400
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,890
I will retain all...

401
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:17,198
and Franquito will
help me run the bar as my number two.

402
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:21,002
Speaking of number two...

403
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:22,973
Dude.

404
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,703
Goddamn it! Come on. I just cleaned that.

405
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,802
That's Frank's butt smell.
That is it. I told you.

406
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,437
- Oh, no!
- That is the exact smell of the chair.

407
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,505
Everything is better than it was before.

408
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,346
- No, it isn't.
- No.

409
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:35,979
- It's so much worse.
- I have my son to rule with me.

410
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,047
- No, you don't.
- What do you mean?

411
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,287
Because Franquito's not your son.
I made it all up.

412
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:43,851
What? How?

413
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,419
All right, look, guys, it's very simple.

414
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:48,296
Seven years ago,
I walked into a Wawa, and I saw this guy...

415
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:52,098
and I thought, "Holy shit! That guy looks
just like Frank, but, you know, Mexican."

416
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:55,368
And then I came up with a plan where I could
make Frank believe...

417
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,501
that he had a son with our maid Josefina
all those years ago...

418
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,511
and I could bilk him
out of a shitload of money...

419
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:03,673
under the guise that the money was all going
to his firstborn son, Franquito...

420
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:05,580
when, in fact, the money was going to me.

421
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,243
And it worked too. It was a good plan.

422
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,550
Yeah, but that's, like,
incredibly devious, dude.

423
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,989
I mean,
you've been screwing Frank for years?

424
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:15,049
You would have done that too, right,
if you'd thought of it?

425
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,324
- Uh, I don't know.
- I don't know, man. I mean...

426
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:21,457
Yeah, I think you guys would have, but
either way, it doesn't matter, you know...

427
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:24,526
'cause everything is, uh,
as it should be, so let's grab some drinks.

428
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,332
- No, everything is not as it should be.
- Wait, wait.

429
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,895
You tried to screw us out of the bar.

430
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,702
- Yeah, you tried to steal the bar.
- No, no, no.

431
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,766
I was trying to get things back
to the way they were...

432
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:33,334
Get him back on the throne...

433
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,710
so we could get back
to doing the things we love to do...

434
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:39,512
at Paddy's, you know, like, um, finding out
what's at the bottom of a hole.

435
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,075
- Shit.
- Right? Did we ever...

436
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,280
Did you ever find out what was
at the bottom of that?

437
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,289
- No, we dropped it completely.
- Oh, shit, dude.

438
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,052
There could be a <i>Goonies</i> situation
down there, right?

439
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,889
- That's what I was thinking.
- We were discussing that.

440
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,792
- You know, the hole in the bathroom?
- You feeling better?

441
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,764
- I feel pretty good about this.
- Let's go check it out.

442
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,096
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's... It's in the bathroom.

443
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:59,103
- You want to try to flush that
thing one more time? - Ah, the hole.

444
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,265
Oh, I'm so excited things are back
to the way they were.

445
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,876
Yes.

446
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:10,109
Go play in your little hole,
you fools.

447
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:13,174
You still need me to stick around,
or can I...

448
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,812
No, Franquito. We're done here.

449
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,651
Can I get my five bucks?

450
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:20,283
Yes, you can get your five
bucks. Goddamn, you're a greedy bastard.

451
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:31,500
