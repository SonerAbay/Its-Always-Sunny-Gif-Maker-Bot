1
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:05,026
I just... I can't
believe you just bought, like,

2
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,328
another ridiculous ugly car.

3
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,530
You are lucky I am
letting you into my goddamn...

4
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:10,666
Oh, shit, okay, okay, here
she comes, here she comes.

5
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:12,233
Okay, see, what is she doing?

6
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:14,235
She appears to be delivering food.

7
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,070
No. That's not what I'm
saying-- I know that.

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:18,173
She's actually delivering Indian
food now-- it's a good gig.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,008
But I mean, why is she
not locking up her bike?

10
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:21,009
This is a bad neighborhood.

11
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:22,010
Oh, shit.

12
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,011
Okay, look at this guy.

13
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,012
He's totally gonna steal it.

14
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,846
I got to move.

15
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:26,381
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:28,717
Keep it moving, guy!

17
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:30,719
Goddamn it!

18
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:31,553
Charlie!

19
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:32,521
What are you doing here?

20
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:34,489
You're just leaving your bike unlocked?

21
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:36,391
I'm protecting it so
it doesn't get stolen!

22
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:37,392
Okay, you know what?

23
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm done.

24
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:39,695
I am so done with this.

25
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,663
You need to stop stalking me.

26
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,031
You need to leave me alone.

27
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:45,500
Look... do you have any idea
what a mess your life would be

28
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,369
if I wasn't always helping you out?

29
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:48,370
I keep a list.

30
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:50,205
I keep a list of things
that I do, okay?

31
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,207
I watch your bike so it
doesn't get stolen, okay?

32
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,276
I put, uh... I put vitamins in your
shampoo so your hair doesn't fall out.

33
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,812
I test your food so it
doesn't get poisoned.

34
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,713
Charlie! Listen to me.

35
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,080
I am finished.

36
00:00:59,148 --> 00:01:00,114
Stop following me.

37
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:01,115
Do you want me to be happy?

38
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:02,183
Do you want me to be happy?

39
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,017
Yes!

40
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,253
Then stop being around
every time I turn around!

41
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,722
You have to leave me alone!

42
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:09,358
You want me to be, like, gone forever?

43
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:11,760
Yes. Do you hear me?

44
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I hear you. It's... Okay.

45
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:21,202
Okay, so this is good-bye?

46
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,805
Yeah. Good-bye, I guess.

47
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:24,840
Great.

48
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:27,208
Okay, good. Thank you.

49
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:29,745
Bye. Goddamn.

50
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:31,680
 Charlie.

51
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,915
Oh, shit, she slammed you, huh?

52
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,917
Do you want to follow
her around some more?

53
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:39,053
Nah, whatever, she's, like...
she's right, you know?

54
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,889
Can we just go back to the bar, Dee?

55
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:43,925
Mm, no, I'd like to follow her around.

56
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,061
Uh... goddamn it!

57
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:49,330
If you don't have car insurance,
you better have dental because I

58
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,332
am gonna smash your teeth into dust!

59
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,334
So sorry, that
was completely my fault.

60
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:58,740
Yeah, it's goddamn your fault, I...
Oh... look at you. My God.

61
00:01:58,808 --> 00:01:59,841
I'm Trevor.

62
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,843
This is my sister Ruby.

63
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:06,047
Hi.

64
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:11,185
Hi.

65
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:14,188
Hi.

66
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,591
Hi.

67
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:22,363
Oh, geez.

68
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:36,334
Sync & corrections by 

69
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,026
No. I don't understand.

70
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:48,278
None of this is making any sense.

71
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:50,801
Dude... what is not
to understand, okay?

72
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,563
We got in an accident, right?

73
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,350
They felt a little bad about it,
one thing led to another, they

74
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,282
asked us out to, like, a dinner date.

75
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:57,765
Who are these people exactly?

76
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,681
- Trevor and Ruby Taft. Right?
- Yeah.

77
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,791
What do you mean "Taft"?

78
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:03,325
Like... the Taft family?

79
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:04,293
I don't know.

80
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,828
Yeah, Taft family, yes.

81
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:06,889
That's a good get, Charlie.

82
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:09,506
I'm rich, but these people
are in the stratosphere.

83
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,238
Yeah, my whole
family was a Taft family.

84
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,020
My uncles and grandfathers and cousins
all worked for TaftCo Enterprises.

85
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,840
My uncle even drowned in a
vat of their molten steel.

86
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:19,609
He didn't drown, he burned up.

87
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:20,576
Yeah, he probably burned.

88
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:21,577
Yeah, I don't think he drowned.

89
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,579
Either way, this is a
great opportunity, okay?

90
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,915
Do not screw this up, because if
you get into a family like this,

91
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:26,949
it's like becoming royalty.

92
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:28,317
What's the plan for the date?

93
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,787
The... I mean, no plans.

94
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:31,788
We were just gonna be ourselves.

95
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:32,855
Ha!

96
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:33,823
Don't.

97
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:34,824
Do not be yourself.

98
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:35,925
No, no, no, that's terrible.

99
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,259
Be anybody but yourselves.

100
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,227
Anybody!

101
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:41,731
Charlie, do not eat any cheese or
any cheese-like substances, okay?

102
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,533
If you see any cheese,
you run away from it!

103
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,468
Dee, do not be a drunk, punchy
whore, okay, you whore?

104
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,236
But... No, there's no buts!

105
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:48,203
There's no buts.

106
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:52,174
Do not screw this up for me-- for you...
for all of us.

107
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:54,209
What is the plan for the date?

108
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:59,582
I guess we'll become one
of them or something.

109
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,519
Now, uh, as I understand it, your
family came over on the Mayflower?

110
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:06,889
Um, yes, they can actually be traced
back to the original settlement.

111
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,892
Oh, yeah. Well, I imagine they
destroyed many an Indian.

112
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,893
Mm.

113
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,162
I too sort of have distaste
for the Indians, you know?

114
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,129
They're savage things.

115
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:15,097
They're nasty, really.

116
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,032
Right, right, they needed
to be exterminated.

117
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,736
I mean, you hate to say it, but...
You do hate to, but it's the truth.

118
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:22,605
So congratulations to your family.

119
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,641
Uh, my family, uh, we were...
we were a railroad family.

120
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,544
That's right, the Vandervelts
were a distant relative.

121
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,545
Right, yeah.

122
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:33,549
Well, and I, too, am of a large...
um, money-ful family.

123
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:34,650
He, too.

124
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:38,020
Shippers of-of goods and, uh...
Services.

125
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:43,092
Builders of... tall... Buildings.

126
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,527
Would anyone like a drink?

127
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:46,963
A drink? No, thank you.

128
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,931
No, thank you, never will I drink.

129
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,434
Whoop! Mm...

130
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:53,569
It's all right.

131
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:54,604
That's all right.

132
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,338
Is he all right?

133
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,811
Just talk about a different...
I can ignore the cheese.

134
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,313
It's not... I'm sorry, I can't do it!

135
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:05,414
All right, then screw it.

136
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:07,449
'Cause I've been eying
this guy all night long.

137
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:09,251
Excuse me, oh!

138
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,688
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

139
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,323
We've been putting on airs.

140
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,759
I know I come across,
like, super fancy.

141
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:17,727
I'm not.

142
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:23,132
We're not the blue blood fancy
types that you think that we are.

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,700
Thank God!

144
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,636
We thought we made a huge mistake.

145
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,539
We like you guys 'cause you aren't
anything like the people that we know.

146
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:30,339
Really?

147
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:31,306
Yes.

148
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,274
Oh, my God.

149
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:35,044
Oh, shit, that is such a relief
because look at this pit stain.

150
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,979
I mean, we're, like,
totally, like, normal.

151
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,381
Oh, I'm sweating like...
You like this pit stain?

152
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:40,816
That's nasty, yo!

153
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,719
I've got bodily functions, I'm sorry!

154
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,988
Hey, guys, can we do some shots?

155
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,624
Yes! I would love to do some shots.

156
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,560
Right, see, we're getting after it now!

157
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:51,594
We're getting after it!

158
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:53,429
No, no, see, this doesn't add up.

159
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,530
This does not make any sense.

160
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:55,531
Why is this going well?

161
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:56,886
Can the girl not smell Charlie?

162
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,752
Can the guy not see Dee?

163
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,321
Something's fishy.

164
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:02,356
Dennis, don't poke holes in this, okay?

165
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:04,825
This is like Lady Di being
plucked from the streets like

166
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:07,761
the trash she was and the trash
that Charlie and Dee are.

167
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,063
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

168
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,831
I know what's going on here, guys.

169
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,832
Now this makes sense.

170
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,601
See, I know what's happening here.

171
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,536
This is a <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses.</i>

172
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:16,504
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

173
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,005
<i>A what?</i>

174
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,039
<i>Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

175
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:19,840
<i>What is that?</i>

176
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:20,808
<i>The movie.</i>

177
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:21,775
<i>I don't know that movie.</i>

178
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:23,544
It was like-like <i>Cruel Intentions.</i>

179
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:24,679
<i>She's All That?</i>

180
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,646
<i>Can't Buy Me Love?</i>

181
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:27,848
<i>Almost any movie made in the late '90s?</i>

182
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,219
<i>Guys, guys, these are the games
that rich people with nothing</i>

183
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:33,821
<i>but time on their hands play
with people that they perceive</i>

184
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:35,856
<i>to be below them.</i>

185
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,625
<i>That girl is just toying with Charlie.</i>

186
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:38,593
<i>She's gonna crush him.</i>

187
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,528
<i>Yeah, I hate to say it,
but I think you're right.</i>

188
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:41,495
<i>What about Dee?</i>

189
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:42,330
<i>What, Dee?</i>

190
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,298
<i>No, she's constantly being crushed.</i>

191
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,033
<i>She'll bounce back, she always does.</i>

192
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,101
<i>Or she won't. It doesn't matter.</i>

193
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,068
<i>I don't care about that.</i>

194
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:50,003
<i>All I care about is Charlie here.</i>

195
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,711
<i>Now, guys, we got to
dig a little deeper.</i>

196
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:01,012
Oh!

197
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,006
Ooh! Ooh!

198
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,226
Oh, look at this.

199
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:05,227
Look at this. Shall we?

200
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,195
You're going.

201
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:07,162
Oh, no, no, no.

202
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,130
No, you guys are going, right?

203
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:09,098
No. Get in the car and leave.

204
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:10,099
No, we' c Ping with.

205
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,066
Don't glom onto this.

206
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:12,034
Hi, you guys.

207
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,326
Hey, you brought some friends.

208
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,743
No.
No. No, not friends. Hobos.

209
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,993
Yeah. Come on in. The
more, the merrier.

210
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,014
You guys up for some tennis?

211
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,182
Yeah!

212
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:20,016
Yeah. You got booze?

213
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,217
You got food?

214
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,085
You got stuff to eat?

215
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:23,252
All right.

216
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,551
All right, Frank, I'll play
on Ruby's team, and over the

217
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:32,072
course of the game, I'll subtly extract
her plan to humiliate Charlie.

218
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:32,994
I'll get her.

219
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:35,128
Oh, yes, I will definitely have her.

220
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,482
Whoa, whoa, Dennis, you're
not gonna hit on her, right?

221
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,517
Huh? No, no.

222
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,084
Look, you sounded like you
were gonna try to bang her.

223
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:43,088
I'm not gonna hit on her, okay?
I'm not gonna try and bang her.

224
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,125
- Don't. Don't do it.
- Just, will you trust me?

225
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,260
Whoa!

226
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,595
Come on! Come on, Frank!

227
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:54,566
Oh, hey, stay on that side
when the ball comes to you.

228
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:58,070
No.

229
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,237
Ball!

230
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,372
Damn it!

231
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,573
Hey, yo, Ruby.

232
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,675
Time out, time out.

233
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:03,842
Let's take a little break.

234
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,044
Yeah?

235
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,045
Let's take a little breather.

236
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,036
I thought you said you
were good at this.

237
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:07,958
I am good.

238
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:11,083
It's just, you know, this shirt
is, like, ridiculously-tight,

239
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,352
and it's restricting my play, so, I
think I'm just gonna pop it off.

240
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,620
Oh.

241
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:17,855
What do you think about this?

242
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:18,990
About what?

243
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,491
What I'm presenting you.

244
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,116
I think you look really pale.
Do you need some sunscreen?

245
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:25,596
Well, it's the first of the season.

246
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,932
I haven't had a chance to get
a base going, you know...?

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,575
Dennis? Dennis?

248
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:30,033
What do you think of the pecs?
What do you think of...?

249
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:31,354
- Dennis?!
- What?

250
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:32,675
Come here!

251
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:33,858
Give me a second, all right?

252
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:35,277
What?

253
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,089
I thought you said you
weren't gonna hit on her.

254
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,190
Am I hitting on her?

255
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,225
Yeah.

256
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,192
Oh, shit. Okay.

257
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,393
No, you're right.

258
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:42,547
Okay, I went into default mode.
My bad.

259
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:43,411
Yeah, all right.

260
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:44,628

Whoa! Whoa!

276
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,808
Shit. No. No.

277
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,110
Oh, sorry. He... You startled me.

278
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:34,480
That's a pretty good stance you got there.
Are you trained?

279
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:36,815
I spent some training, yeah.

280
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:38,016
You?

281
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,151
Yeah. Krav Maga.

282
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,319
That's cool.

283
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:41,487
Judo, karate.

284
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:43,855
I got more of a Catholic
thing going on.

285
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:46,158
You know, sort of the hand of God.

286
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:47,326
Stupid idiot. Get out here!

287
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,461
Beat it. We were in the
middle of a thing.

288
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,663
No, no. That was really cool.

289
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,598
Could you show me that last move again?

290
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,700
Get out of here! Go on!

291
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:55,867
Get of here!

292
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:57,836
We're in the middle of some...
the middle of something.

293
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey, whoa.

294
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,139
Ow.

295
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,007
Sorry you got a cramp.

296
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,110
Oh, she's really digging her
hooks into him, mm-hmm.

297
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,312
What a bitch.

298
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:08,414
Ugh! Hold on a second.

299
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,549
Oh, the same person keeps calling me.

300
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:11,684
I'm just gonna answer it.

301
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:12,884
Hello. Who is this?

302
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,052
Who? Who is...?

303
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,187
I don't know that name.

304
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:16,355
Who? Who?

305
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:17,523
Oh, oh, Waitress.

306
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,724
Why didn't you just say that?

307
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,026
Uh, because my name is not Waitress.

308
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,194
Okay, you know what?

309
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:23,362
It doesn't even matter.

310
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,563
Did Charlie steal my bike?

311
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,731
What are you talking about?

312
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,033
Charlie's been with me the entire day.

313
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,201
How did you get this number?

314
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,402
I changed it.

315
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,538
Look, I need my bike back,
because if I don't get it back,

316
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:33,672
I'm gonna lose my job.

317
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,841
Look, I don't...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ugh!

318
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,139
Hello? Hello?

319
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,051
God! I'm gonna have to change
my number again... Holy shit.

320
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:44,808
Oh, no.
Frank, I just realized something.

321
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,148
What?

322
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:48,551
Without Charlie doing all those
insane things he's always

323
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:50,820
doing for the waitress, her life
is gonna completely change.

324
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:51,987
What do you mean?

325
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,787
Well, so, she's gonna be
constantly calling or dropping

326
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,290
by, looking for answers, so
there's a very good chance that

327
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:01,828
she's gonna have a front-row seat for
the final moment of humiliation.

328
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,197
And that's gonna destroy
Charlie for good.

329
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,500
What's the final moment of humiliation?

330
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,968
That's the climactic moment
where the rich people reveal

331
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:11,138
their twisted game to all their
wealthy friends, and everybody

332
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,272
has a good laugh.

333
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,607
Okay, Frank, here's what's
gonna have to happen.

334
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:18,011
You're gonna have to do all of
those creepy things on Charlie's

335
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,081
list to keep the waitress from
poking around while this whole

336
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,249
thing runs its course.

337
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:23,483
What are you gonna do?

338
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:24,651
Phew!

339
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:29,322
I got something very important planned.

340
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:31,958
Come in! There's a problem!

341
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,327
I can't make head or tail of
Charlie's chicken scratch!

342
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:36,629
Just do the best you can, okay?

343
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,965
I can't... can't really talk right now.

344
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,334
Putting rat poison in her shampoo.

345
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,636
Just gonna make her hair fall out.
Crazy.

346
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,804
I don't know.

347
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,174
Look, the kid knows her
better than anybody else.

348
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,643
If he puts rat poison in her hair,
put rat poison in her hair.

349
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,844
Look, I'm busy. I can't talk.

350
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,147
What do you mean, you're busy?!

351
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,315
This is the whole thing, Dennis!

352
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,484
I'm just... I'm getting
some stuff done, okay?

353
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:58,685
Oh, shit!

354
00:11:58,752 --> 00:11:59,652
I think she just came in.

355
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,955
I'm getting another call.

356
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,123
Hold on, hold on. Hello?

357
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,291
Who? Who?!

358
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,492
Just say Waitress!

359
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,794
Look, has Charlie been poisoning me?

360
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,130
'Cause I've been...

361
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:12,466
Frank, you got to step it
up with that list, man.

362
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,600
This bitch is driving me nuts.

363
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,767
What happened?

364
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,935
Just, I'm busy, okay?

365
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,104
Just do it.

366
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,740
Hello?! Hello?!

367
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,209
Hello?

368
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,177
Charlie?

369
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:27,880
No. It's your neighbor.

370
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:39,083
Can I be, like, perfectly honest
with you about something?

371
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,250
Yeah.

372
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,452
There's a... there's a girl who
lives in this building, and,

373
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,790
um, well, she's... she's
the love of my life.

374
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:47,991
Okay.

375
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,329
And, uh... and I like you so
much that before we move any

376
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,530
further, I just... I don't know.

377
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,999
I had to get that out there,
'cause I think I'm ready to let

378
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,335
her go, but I just have to be sure.

379
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,502
Does that make sense?

380
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,704
Yeah.

381
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:01,839
Charlie? There you are.

382
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,507
Look, I don't know what kind of
twisted game you're playing, but

383
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,675
you need to make it stop.

384
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,810
Whoa. Hold on a second.

385
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:09,179
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

386
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,449
Really? Because someone's been
poisoning me, and something

387
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,583
is making my hair just fall out.

388
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:14,752
Look, calm down, all right?

389
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,121
I-I... I've been with her
the last couple days.

390
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:19,456
I really haven't been
anywhere near you.

391
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:20,624
Yeah, he's been with me.

392
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:21,792
Oh, shut up, bitch!

393
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,060
Who the hell is this, Charlie?!

394
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,328
Hey! No. She...

395
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:31,434
She's my girlfriend.

396
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:34,972
Oh, my God.

397
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,106
Sorry about that.

398
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,274
Come on.

399
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:38,441
Let's get out of here.

400
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,211
I'm sorry about that. Wow.

401
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,783
How's this, Trevor?

402
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,917
Is this cool?

403
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:48,786
Very cool.

404
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:49,753
Get off me!

405
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:50,720
Shut up, Dee!

406
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,824
I got that stupid bitch.

407
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,593
Oh! Goddamn it!

408
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,061
Goddamn it! Oh!

409
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,362
Clocked him.

410
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,500
Oh! Oh... Oh, no... Amazing!

411
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,501
You guys are out of control.

412
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:05,468
I'm out of control.

413
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:06,436
I'm out of control.

414
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:07,404
Yeah, you are.

415
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,307
Hey, I want to invite you two to a
party at our estate tomorrow night.

416
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,309
My father's going public with TaftCo.

417
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,912
Oh, well, then... are you
sure you want him to come?

418
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,346
Of course.

419
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:17,314
He's practically family.

420
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,315
Hey!

421
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,550
Come on, show me some
more of those moves.

422
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:23,187
Oh, yeah. Okay, well, this
next stuff I learned from a

423
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:24,154
wrestler called The Maniac.

424
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:26,790
So we're gonna have to go ahead
and get pretty oiled up.

425
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,591
Sure.

426
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,592
Great.

427
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,868
This is classy as shit, huh?

428
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,305
Dee, crack that open for me,
'cause it's hurting my hands.

429
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:43,707
Yeah. I wonder why he didn't
tell us it was black-tie.

430
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:44,842
I feel like we're underdressed.

431
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:47,911
Because, Dee, Trevor loves us for us.

432
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:48,912
Hey.

433
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,880
Oh, hey!

434
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:51,114
Glad you guys could make it.

435
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,649
Thanks, man! How you doing?

436
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,617
These are a few of my
old frat brothers.

437
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,786
This is Dee and Mac that
I was telling you about.

438
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,754
Hi.

439
00:14:57,822 --> 00:14:59,223
What's up, boys?

440
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,457
How are you?

441
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,827
Hey, um, I'm sorry that we're
not dressed appropriately.

442
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:05,863
I mean, you guys all look so good.

443
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,232
Oh, well, the attire at these
sorts of events are... well,

444
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,167
things my friends and
I take for granted.

445
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,168
Don't be embarrassed, though.

446
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,503
You guys didn't know any better.

447
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:17,241
No, <i>I</i> should've known better, 'cause
I'm practically a Taft myself.

448
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:19,609
My uncle's probably built into
the foundation of this place.

449
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:20,878
Really? Weird.

450
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,880
Hey, where do you want us to sit?

451
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,615
Well, you guys'll be out here
with some of my frat brothers'

452
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:29,086
guests.

453
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:34,124
Now, if you'll excuse us, we all
have some catching up to do.

454
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:39,129
Oh, yeah. We'll... we'll meet you af...
we'll see you after.

455
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,330
Kind of weird, right?

456
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,400
Yeah, but at least we can make fun of
these dorks all night long, right?

457
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,501
That'll be fun. Geeks!

458
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,004
Oh, no, Mac.

459
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,539
I see what's going on here.

460
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,175
He's doing to us what I like to
do to Charlie and the waitress.

461
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,176
Huh?

462
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,613
Oh, no. Follow me.

463
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,081
Oh!

464
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:59,149
I got that stupid bitch.

465
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,118
Oh! Goddamn it!

466
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,120
Oh!

467
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:04,687
Man, biggest losers ever.

468
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,123
You know it.

469
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,124
Oh!

470
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,458
Oh!

471
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,993
That's two for one, fellas.

472
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,094
Come on, pay up, pay up.

473
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:14,164
Those two are by far the worst
we've ever had. Let's go.

474
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:16,300
Goddamn it.

475
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,634
I can't believe it.

476
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:20,170
That's a tough pill to swallow.

477
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:21,204
What are you doing here?

478
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,942
You know, they're not the only ones
who know how to play these games.

479
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:25,909
Huh?

480
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:26,876
What?

481
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,845
I'm saying I also know...
I have a thing.

482
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:29,813
Just come with me. Come with me.

483
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,982
All right, folks, if you
could settle down, please?

484
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,383
If I could have your attention.

485
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,485
Uh, thank you all for
being here tonight.

486
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:38,922
I, uh, I wanted you all here
so that I could tell you this.

487
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,094
I've decided to go public with
TaftCo Enterprises.

488
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,396
Wonderful! Oh, bravo!

489
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,165
Excuse me. Fantastic, Neil!

490
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,168
Good for you! Good for you!

491
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:54,604
Too bad when you do, the SEC's
gonna be all up in your ass.

492
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:56,573
What?

493
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,142
You see, you thought you all
could get together and play your

494
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,679
little games, have some fun, you
know, invite some geeks to the

495
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:08,385
ball, swap some stories, have a laugh.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

496
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:11,355
But you took it a little too far...
when you gave an

497
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,756
inside-trading tip to my friend
Mac, didn't you, Trevor?

498
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,093
What are you talking about?

499
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,396
Pedro.

500
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,764
And by the way, my father's
going public with TaftCo next

501
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,535
week, so buy stock today at 34, not 36.

502
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,772
Cool. Yeah, I'll call my broker.

503
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,708
Right, call your broker.

504
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,652
Ooh... you ready for
round two, big guy?

505
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:35,770
This-this is taken out of context.

506
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,917
What was the context?

507
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:37,627
Wrestling.

508
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:38,549
It's wrestling.

509
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,082
We're oiled up and wrestling.

510
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,251
What is so hard to
understand about this?!

511
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:48,390
Nice, huh?

512
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,602
Trevor... you imbecile!

513
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,729
Why would you tell him that?

514
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:56,302
I didn't know I was being filmed.

515
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,537
If you're in my room,
you're always being filmed.

516
00:17:58,605 --> 00:17:59,739
It's true.

517
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,877
It's his thing, it's kind of creepy, but...
But that's not all, everyone.

518
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:07,671
You see, Ruby Taft, she likes to play
her little games, too, don't you Ruby?

519
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,621
But I am not gonna let you
humiliate my other friend either.

520
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:13,749
Cause he might be choosing
someone else after all.

521
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:17,257
Charlie, phone call for you.

522
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:19,960
Charlie, somebody
accidentally hit the waitress

523
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,930
with my car-- <i>their</i> car, when
they were following her.

524
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,131
No... she wants to talk to you.

525
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,399
She says she really needs you.

526
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,654
Wait, did <i>she</i> say that, or
are <i>you</i> just saying it?

527
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,372
Yeah, talk to her yourself.

528
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,575
Charlie, look, I don't know
what's been going on, but if you

529
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:37,744
think you can make it
stop, I need your help.

530
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,880
I want you back in my life.

531
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:41,582
Do you really mean that?

532
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,684
Yeah.

533
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:45,719
I need you.

534
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:48,088
Okay. I'll be right there.

535
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:49,356
Awesome. Well, I'm out of here.

536
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,358
What? What are you talking about.

537
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:52,325
I'm leaving.

538
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,895
I'm going to be with the
waitress-- she's the woman I love.

539
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:57,430
No, but I... I wasn't using
you like Charlie was.

540
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:58,499
He's a total asshole.

541
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:00,868
I really, really, really like you.

542
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,068
Oh.

543
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:04,304
Yeah, I know.

544
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,006
Okay? I was using <i>you.</i>

545
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:08,441
<i>That's why I kissed you
in front of the waitress.</i>

546
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,410
<i>That's why I banged you a bunch
of times, just to make the</i>

547
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:11,378
<i>waitress jealous.</i>

548
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,614
<i>Amazing. You slept with
me almost instantly.</i>

549
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,549
<i>And by the way, a quality
woman doesn't do that.</i>

550
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:16,817
<i>She doesn't say yes right away.</i>

551
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,785
<i>She says no to a man, for
years, like, ten years.</i>

552
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,587
<i>That's what a real woman does, okay?</i>

553
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:24,024
<i>You know what you were acting like?
A stupid little rich slut.</i>

554
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,626
<i>And that's all that you are.</i>

555
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,694
<i>How can you do this to me?</i>

556
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:28,662
<i>Are you still talking?</i>

557
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,863
<i>Go away, dumb-dumb.</i>

558
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,832
<i>Go run and hide. Go from me.</i>

559
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,768
<i>I don't want to see you anymore.</i>

560
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:36,770
<i>Women, right?</i>

561
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:38,038
<i>Ah, man, all right, cool.</i>

562
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:41,374
<i>I'm out! All right!</i>

563
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:42,809
<i>I didn't see that coming.</i>

564
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,477
<i>No.</i>

565
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:48,949
<i>Guess Charlie had the cruelest
intentions of all, huh?</i>

566
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:51,752
<i>Uh, see? Feeling better?</i>

567
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:53,219
<i>Yeah.</i>

568
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:56,940
<i>You know, I-I've, um, I've been
thinking about the restraining order.</i>

569
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,207
<i>You're gonna get rid of it?</i>

570
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,575
<i>No. No, no.</i>

571
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:02,978
<i>But, um, but I was thinking
about reducing it from, like, a</i>

572
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:06,882
<i>hundred feet to, like... 50 feet?</i>

573
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,850
<i>Awesome! Okay.</i>

574
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:08,817
<i>Okay.</i>

575
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:09,818
<i>I can work with that.</i>

576
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:10,953
<i>All right.</i>

577
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:13,077
<i>Oh, so now? Starting now?</i>

578
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:13,997
<i>Yeah, probably.</i>

579
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:15,699
<i>Could you just leave the soup there?</i>

580
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:19,670
<i>Uh... is this okay over here, or...?</i>

581
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:23,240
<i>Uh, I don't think there's
50 feet in this room, so...</i>

582
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:24,955
<i>I'll go down the hall. Okay.</i>

583
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,101
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

584
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:27,896
<i>All right, well, that's fine.</i>

585
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,566
<i>From a distance, though.</i>
