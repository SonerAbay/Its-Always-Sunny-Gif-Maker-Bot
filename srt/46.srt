1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,380
[Dennis] Stop it. [Charlie] All right.
You're getting hung up on "can't."

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:09,133
And I'm not saying that you can't.
I'm saying that it is illegal.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,885
No, it is not illegal!
Dude.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,970
Says the guy who knows
nothing about the law!

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,306
I can absolutely keep
a hummingbird as a pet, bro.

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,393
It's no different than having a parrot,
or a parakeet. It's a bird, bro.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,104
You really can't, and I'm
not saying I agree with it.

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,773
It's just that bird law in this country-
it's not governed by reason.

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,150
There is no such thing as bird law.
Yes, there is!

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,945
I'm gonna get a hummingbird, and I'll show you.
You guys, I have huge news.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,364
Hummingbirds are illegal tender.
I'm gonna get one.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,408
You cannot.
To spite you, I'm gonna get one.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,410
Hello?
Where are we with gulls?

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,787
You guys!
You can keep a gull as a pet.

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,290
But you do not want to live with a seabird,
'cause the noise level alone on those things...

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,377
Have you ever heard a gull up close?
It's gonna blast your eardrums out, dude.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,671
You guys, I'm serious!
I have huge news here!

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,298
The principle is that you
can have any bird that- Yo!

19
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,135
I got great news, guys.
Frank's got news?

20
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,595
Frank's got news?
[Chanting] News, news, news, news!

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,932
News, news, news, news,
news, news, news, news!

22
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,561
I just bought a house
at a foreclosure auction.

23
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,813
Holy shit!
That's amazing.

24
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,857
Oh, is it? Is it "amazing"?

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,234
- Now hang on. You're not moving out, are you?
- No, no, no, no.

26
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,903
I bought this as an investment.
I bought it on the cheap.

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:14,741
Ah, you might've missed the boat on that, Frank.
Not the best time to invest.

28
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,743
I beg to differ with you.

29
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,121
Now is the time to invest
because all the prices are low.

30
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,958
As soon as the market turns around,
I'm gonna make a boatload.

31
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,002
Frank's talking about flipping the house.
Flip the house!

32
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,421
Making some money!
That's exciting.

33
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,174
I'm having a baby!

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,471
Do yourself a favor
and flush it out.

35
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,390
No. That's not-
"Flush it out"?

36
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,434
No. I'm not pregnant. I...

37
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,978
I answered an ad for a couple
who wants a surrogate.

38
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,774
See, people who can't have kids are willing to
pay a shitload of money to people like myself,

39
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,776
who can carry it for them.

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,320
Wait. What's going on?
You're carrying someone's baby somewhere?

41
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:57,325
H-Hold it. I am not spending
money on another little bastard.

42
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,119
- I did that already, twice.
- Come on.

43
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,956
No. They're keeping the baby. It's their baby.
How are you guys not understanding this?

44
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,501
Uh, Dee, before you
continue this babbling,

45
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,003
does your thing
involve us in any way,

46
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,589
or are you just
kind of- at us?

47
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,343
Well, no. It's just that's huge news, so
I figured you guys might want to know.

48
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,929
It doesn't matter. Let's just talk about the house!
Let's talk about the house!

49
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,932
Hold on one second. Actually, Dee
being pregnant is pretty big news.

50
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,143
Now, we could take the house idea and
the baby idea and merge the two things.

51
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,687
It just feels muddy though.
Let's just stick with one. It's cleaner, right?

52
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,731
- It could be an interesting-
- House.

53
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,817
But I'm just saying that if- House.

54
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,486
I don't know exactly how we would take
the two ideas and put them together.

55
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,613
House! But I think if we
came up with something...

56
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,490
[Chanting]
House! House! House!

57
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,617
Just the house thing?
House! House! House! House!

58
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:44,372
House, house, house, house, house,
house, house, house, house, house!

59
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,623
Flush, flush, flush!

60
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,035
Deandra? Thank you so much
for responding to our ad in the paper.

61
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,205
You're welcome. We've had so many
letdowns going through the agency.

62
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,375
Yeah. We thought we'd just try to
find a surrogate by ourselves.

63
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,795
I just feel really honored to be able to provide
a service for a lovely couple like yourselves.

64
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,505
Good. Thank you.
Yeah.

65
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,258
We just had a couple questions
we'd like to ask you. Shoot.

66
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,677
Honey, why don't you-
Okay. So- Sorry.

67
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,305
But do you have any history
with drugs or alcohol?

68
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,057
Never. Neither.
That's great.

69
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,977
Um, any- any family history
of mental illness?

70
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,397
Uh, well, my brother's
a dick, if that counts.

71
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,566
I don't- I don't think so.

72
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,443
It's just a joke though, Sean.
So, the next one?

73
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,362
And- And- Okay.
So what about your medical history?

74
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,781
Is there any health problems
we should know about?

75
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,783
Kate, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

76
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,745
I have never had a health
problem in my entire life.

77
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,455
Wow.

78
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,082
Clean as a whistle.
That's amazing.

79
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,169
- Down here, up here, wherever.
- This is all great news. I mean...

80
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,212
Isn't it?
Yes, it really is.

81
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,049
Okay, great. So let's talk turkey.
And by that, I mean money.

82
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,843
Oh. We just thought we'd pay
the standard rate of $20,000.

83
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,929
20,000. Okay.
Yeah.

84
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:27,099
I like the sound of that. I'm gonna throw
something at you guys, so brace yourselves.

85
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:31,979
What are your thoughts on
doubling down, so to speak,

86
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,649
and going for twins?

87
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,776
[Chuckles] Right?

88
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,611
No.
No.

89
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,906
If it's a matter of price, I'm willing
to cut you a deal on the second one.

90
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,950
And we don't
have to stop at two.

91
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,453
I've typed up a price sheet I would
like the two of you to peruse.

92
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,331
If you'll look down
around number four or five,

93
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,625
that's when you really
start to see some savings.

94
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,461
You guys want to go for an Octomom thing?
Huh? I'm game.

95
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,464
You want to have 10?
You want to outdo that bitch?

96
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,883
I'll have that conversation.
I'm kidding.

97
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,927
I don't want 10 people
inside of me.

98
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,971
But-
This is great.

99
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,140
I-I just- I think we're really
just gonna do the one,

100
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,142
I think is- is what we want.

101
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,354
One baby.

102
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,607
Look for shit on the walls,
'cause that's what they do.

103
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,152
When they know they're getting thrown out of a
house, they smear feces all over the walls.

104
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,904
Really?
Yes.

105
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,825
They didn't do that here. This is a pretty nice house.
A little lived in maybe.

106
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,369
Well, you know, I found something cooking on the stove.
That's pretty "unresponsible."

107
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,038
Mac and cheese. I can't believe they
left all this stuff in the house.

108
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,416
I mean, what's the deal?
Do we have to burn it?

109
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,085
- Hey, get the hell out of our house!
- Jesus. There's people here!

110
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,005
- Squatters!
- We're not squatters! This is our house!

111
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,882
What do you mean your house?
I bought this house! We own this house!

112
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,468
You didn't buy it from us!
You bought it from the bank. We didn't sell it.

113
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:48,097
Oh, look, bitch! We bought it from them
because they foreclosed on your bitch ass!

114
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,850
Yeah, yeah. You got proof? Proof?
What are you talking about, proof?

115
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,436
A deed, paperwork.
Go get your proof. Proof.

116
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,313
Bring it back here. We'll look at the paperwork.
Is that what you want?

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,984
You want proof? I'll give you proof!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

118
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,029
Frank, take it easy, bud.
Take it- You gotta use your head now.

119
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,031
Think about the law.
All right?

120
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,742
What happens if you accidentally
hit a child with an umbrella?

121
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,870
In the eyes of the law, that is child abuse.
What happens then?

122
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,790
In the eyes of the law, you have to give your
properties to the parents of that child.

123
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,543
I'm sorry, little kid.
He doesn't know the law that well.

124
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,379
I don't even know what the hell he's
talking about. It doesn't matter.

125
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,506
We shouldn't bash these people up.
No. No!

126
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,718
Of course we shouldn't bash
these people up! Look- Okay.

127
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,096
Absolutely, we could cave
the husband's skull in here.

128
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,767
Yes, we could take the wife down to the basement,
have a frenzied free-for-all with her.

129
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,770
We could tie the kids up in their rooms
so they wouldn't hear any of it.

130
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,939
Dennis, in that scenario, we'd have to kill
the kids 'cause they would've seen our faces.

131
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,317
Right. We could smear
the walls with their blood.

132
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,195
Guys, there are any number of twisted
scenarios that could play out here.

133
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,282
But I think the easiest thing, really,
is to just go get the deed.

134
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,785
Right. Why get weird?

135
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,204
Let's just keep it simple.
For now, we take the high road.

136
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,332
We'll take the high road.
Take the high road out of here.

137
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,753
Oh, well, I'm so glad we're gonna
get to work with you, Deandra.

138
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,256
Oh, Kate, Sean, I tell you what.
You guys are getting one hell of a uterus.

139
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,634
Great. Okay. Well, listen.
It was really nice to meet you.

140
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,053
Wow! This house really
opens up here, doesn't it?

141
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,347
Uh- From the curb, it doesn't
really look like much.

142
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
But once you get inside,
it's got a real ass on it.

143
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,561
Well, thank you. It's always felt
a little empty without a family.

144
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,688
Oh, shit! Is that a pool?

145
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,484
Uh, yeah. Of course, when the baby
comes, we'll have a fence around it.

146
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,569
Right, right, right.
How deep?

147
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,071
The pool?
Yeah, the pool!

148
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,073
- Uh, eight feet.
- Oh, man.

149
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,826
You guys jackknife off this diving
board all the time or what?

150
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,038
Oh, I used to be so good at those.
You mind if I get in?

151
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,667
Um- Yeah, we- we have a
lot of stuff to do today.

152
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,710
So-
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

153
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,964
No, errands are very important, but really,
the most important thing right now...

154
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,676
is for me to stay relaxed, if you don't
want my tubes to get all tensed up.

155
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,179
So, you want to go grab
a swimsuit for me to borrow,

156
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,390
or should I just jump in
in my birthday gear?

157
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,768
No. Don't do that. We'll- Honey, do
we have a suit that she can borrow?

158
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,062
Sure. I'll go
get you that suit.

159
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,231
[Sean] Okay.
Good girl.

160
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,943
All right, Charlie.
We are gonna be gentlemen. Yup.

161
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,904
We have the law on our side.
We just show them the deed. Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,906
And then they vacate the premises.
Mm-hmm.

163
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,076
And that's it. No reason to be animals about it.
And they changed the locks.

164
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,787
Yes, they did. You were right, Frank!
They changed the locks, bud.

165
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,831
I'm telling you, these people,
they're uncivilized deadbeats.

166
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,875
Let's smash the door down.
All right, ready? Here we go.

167
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,587
[Together]
And a-one, and a-two, and a-three...

168
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,339
[Shouting]

169
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,009
- [Groans] - [Charlie] Oh,
that- that was a bummer.

170
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,179
Man. I gotta admit,
that's, uh...

171
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,222
That felt
very unsatisfying to me.

172
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,641
- [Frank] Yeah, I didn't like that.
- Should you guys, um...

173
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,394
No. Try smashing it
from the inside?

174
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,606
- Let's just give it another shot. And-
- [Charlie] Oh!

175
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,941
- [Charlie] Give it another one.
- Kick it.

176
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,112
- Nice, dude!
- My door!

177
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,199
My door, deadbeat!
My door!

178
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,910
And what's this shyster lawyer
doing here?

179
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,537
Well, it is just so nice to
see you again, Mr. Reynolds.

180
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,665
I see that you're still
just... horrible.

181
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,543
Yes, you're horrible too.
And I hate your tie. Hey. All right.

182
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,546
You know what?
This family behind me- Yeah.

183
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,590
Has 90 days to vacate.
Deadbeats.

184
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,592
Until then, you can't touch them.
That's bull bird, man.

185
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,012
What do you got there?
Let me handle this, Frank. It's not bull bird.

186
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,556
I'll tell you that right now.
He's making a few good points.

187
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,183
Look, buddy.
Crap.

188
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,685
I know a lot about the law
and various other lawyerings.

189
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,729
I'm well educated, well versed.

190
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,691
I know that situations like this,
real-estate wise, they're very complex.

191
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,902
Actually, they're pretty simple.

192
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,738
The forms are all
standard boilerplate.

193
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,574
Okay. We're all hungry.
We're gonna get to our hot plates soon enough.

194
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,576
All right? Well, let's talk
about the contract here...

195
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,287
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Where did you go to law school again?

196
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,207
Uh, well, I could ask you that very
same question. I went to Harvard.

197
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,959
Ah.
Mm-hmm. How 'bout you?

198
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,753
Where? Yeah? Hmm?
I'm pleading the Fifth, sir.

199
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,755
I'd advise that you do that.

200
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,091
I'll take that advice
into cooperation. All right?

201
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,469
Let's say you and I go toe-to-toe on bird
law and see who comes out the victor.

202
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,264
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna do anything close to that,

203
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,975
and I can see clearly
you know nothing about the law.

204
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,687
It seems like you have a tenuous grasp
on the English language in general.

205
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,606
Okay. Well- Filibuster.

206
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,694
Uh- Do you- Do you know
what that word means?

207
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,487
Yup!
Yeah, what's that mean?

208
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,531
[Sighs]

209
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,704
- [Screams]
- [Door Shattering]

210
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,457
I-I'm gonna- We're gonna- [Groans]

211
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,714
[Frank] No, no, no.
Now I'm all churned up about this.

212
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,049
I can't wait 90 days
to get rid of those people.

213
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,968
I mean,
I gotta sell that house.

214
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,679
Frank, don't be rash.
It's just 90 days.

215
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,432
No. In 90 days, there's gonna
be shit all over those walls.

216
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,559
[Scoffs] Those people are
gonna trash that house.

217
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,644
We won't be able
to get a dime for it.

218
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,688
I am calling
a Realtor right now.

219
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,732
Oh, wait, Frank. Hold on a second.
[Phone Beeps]

220
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,443
Maybe we could sell the house ourselves, you know?
Save the five percent.

221
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,528
What do Realtors do anyway?
They pop on a blazer.

222
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,697
They walk people through a house.
We can do that.

223
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,284
Mac, the real estate business is something that
takes a lot of style and a lot of finesse,

224
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,995
and that's something that the
two of us both have in spades.

225
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,915
Absolutely. I'm thinking we do like a
classic good Realtor-bad Realtor dynamic.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,126
Oh, shit. I'm the good,
you're the bad?

227
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,171
You're the sweet to my sour.
The honey to your vinegar?

228
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,173
That's good, dude!

229
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,176
- Honey and Vinegar Realty.
- I like that.

230
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,220
I like the Honey and Vinegar.
I like what I'm hearing, boys.

231
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,223
Okay! I knew that guy
was full of shit! I knew it!

232
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,018
What guy?
That lawyer guy. Okay?

233
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,730
He totally besmirched me today,
and I demand satisfaction from him.

234
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,399
You want him to bang you?
Uh...

235
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,360
No, Mac. Be serious, okay?

236
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,529
He slandered me in front of a
jury of my own peers. All right?

237
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,033
Look what they used to do when that sort of thing happened.
Take a look at this picture.

238
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,912
- What do you see?
- I see two trannies shooting at each other.

239
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,664
No, dude.
They're dueling, okay?

240
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,210
These are lawyers settling an
argument by dueling it out.

241
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,755
Now, how do you know
that the two trannies are lawyers?

242
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,218
'Cause it's an old book, okay?

243
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,721
I don't have to explain everything
to you about what I know!

244
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm trying to get satisfied from
this dude, and you're trying to...

245
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,185
I'm getting satisfied.
I don't care.

246
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,522
- What are you doing, Deandra?
- Collecting the money you bitches owe me.

247
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,607
I'm going on maternity leave.

248
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,234
What are you
jabbering about now?

249
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,487
I got a sweet setup going on as a
surrogate for a couple of rich yuppies.

250
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,572
They have a huge house,
kick-ass pool.

251
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,118
I'm living the high life.
So suck on that, white stains.

252
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,203
Oh, dude!

253
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,747
I knew we should've done the baby thing.
Now there's a pool involved?

254
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,667
When was the last time you swam in a pool?
I want to swim in the pool!

255
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,129
- It's been like forever since I swam in a pool.
- No, no! Now, let's focus here.

256
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,881
We gotta sell this house.

257
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,676
And then we can go swim
in Deandra's pool.

258
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,475
Hey, Vic.
You got that other snack tray?

259
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,978
I certainly do, Hugh.
Certainly do. Okay, great.

260
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,730
People are gonna be here any second.
I want them to be well fed.

261
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,233
The house looks nice. The house looks nice.
It does look nice.

262
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,068
Hey, hey, hey!

263
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,946
You jerks aren't supposed to be here
when my mom and dad are at work!

264
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,407
Your mom and dad aren't at work.
That's why they lost the house.

265
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,035
They're probably at the dog track getting wasted.
Dude, eat my boogers.

266
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:11,331
You eat my boogers! Whoa, whoa!
Hey, Vic, Vic. Whoa.

267
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,584
Smell that vinegar
boiling up inside you.

268
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,086
But I need you to save
some of it for the customer.

269
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,088
Do that for me, okay, baby boy?

270
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,215
What the hell's going on out here?

271
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,676
- Frank, can you get these kids out of here?
- Yeah. Come on.

272
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,012
We're gonna go paint your room
a color that's not stupid.

273
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,055
Then we're gonna throw
your toys in the trash!

274
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,266
Listen, I need you on my team.
You on my team?

275
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,518
Yeah. I'm- I'm on your team.
All right, great. Yeah?

276
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah. I just- He gets me-
That's good.

277
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,397
[Knocking]
Oh! Here we go.

278
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,317
- Hi! How are ya? - How you doing?
We're here to look at the house.

279
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,903
Of course. Yeah, come on in. Hi.
I'm Hugh Honey. How you doing?

280
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,363
Good. This is my associate,
Vic Vinegar. Hi. Tad.

281
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,782
And we are here
to show you this house.

282
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,202
Okay. Oh!
Good.

283
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,163
Okay. [Chuckles] Come on in.
Great.

284
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,582
Hi.
Okay.

285
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,711
Good. All right. This is the living room.
Okay! Wonderful.

286
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,798
Now, what do you folks think?
It's a beautiful house, right?

287
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,843
Well, you know, I'm thinking this might
be a bit large for what we need.

288
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,514
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
Is this house too big for you? - Now, Vic.

289
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,850
Just a second, Hugh. Why don't you
ask your wife what she needs, pal?

290
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,895
Oh, I'm sorry. Is she used to something smaller,
and you don't think she can handle it?

291
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,148
Okay, I think we're gonna get going.
It's okay, you guys. I'm here.

292
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,735
I want this to be a good experience for you.
Okay? I'll tell you what, buddy.

293
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,071
How 'bout I take your wife upstairs
and show her what it's like...

294
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,114
to be deep inside
a really big house?

295
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,033
What?
What?

296
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,035
What?

297
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,579
Uh, you'll have to
excuse my associate.

298
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,291
It's just his passion for quality real
estate that makes him so intense.

299
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,418
Now, what can we do
to put you in this house?

300
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,128
I think we're just gonna go now.
Yeah.

301
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,506
Are you gonna buy the house?
[Woman] We're gonna go.

302
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,758
Are you going to buy this house?
We don't want any trouble.

303
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,719
Are you going to buy this house?
I don't know! I don't know!

304
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,763
Are you going to buy this house?
Yes! Yes!

305
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,682
"Yes" what?
Yes, I will buy this house!

306
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,935
That's it. There we go. That's all I wanted to hear.
Congratulations, folks.

307
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,187
You just bought
a brand-new house.

308
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,189
Can we go?
Yeah!

309
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,857
Go, honey. Go.
Congratulations.

310
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,359
I'm going!
Just go!

311
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,113
All right. We'll be in touch.
Oh! That was amazing, bro!

312
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,241
You think that's gonna work?
Bro, it already did work. You heard the skirt.

313
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,119
She said, "Yes, I will buy this house."
That is a binding verbal contract.

314
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,163
Now, I heard it. You heard it.
And that pussy husband of hers heard it too.

315
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,543
If they back out now, I will find them, I will
strangle them, I will beat them into oblivion!

316
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,879
Wow! Wow!
I'm full of the vinegar.

317
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,090
- Oh. Yeah!
- Hey. How'd it go?

318
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,717
Sold it!
Sold the house.

319
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,719
Sold it? Fantastic!

320
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,597
Let's get another house,
flip it over, make some cash.

321
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,016
It's not really the cash
that I care about anymore.

322
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,101
It's the thrill of the sale
that I'm responding to.

323
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,937
- You're driven by the thrill of the sale.
- You know what I'm thinking?

324
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,899
Maybe it's time to merge
the two ideas after all.

325
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,527
- Baby in the house?
- Baby in the house.

326
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,908
[Chuckling] Honey and Vinegar?

327
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,495
Okay. Jesus Christ.
All right. I'll get on it.

328
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,706
Mmm.

329
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,209
Well, well, well, well, well!

330
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,464
If it isn't the big-time,
hotshot lawyer man.

331
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,634
Oh, my God.
I do not have time for you.

332
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,637
Yeah, so we both have busy schedules,
so I'll make this quick.

333
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,056
I shan't mince words
with you for long.

334
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,434
I am challenging you,
sir, to a duel.

335
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,394
- I accept.
- Uh...

336
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,731
[Pen Tapping On Desk]
[Chuckles] Are you serious?

337
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,816
Yeah. I accept your challenge.

338
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,569
Do you want time to think it over?
No!

339
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,114
No. No, not at all.
Um, what time were you thinking of dueling?

340
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,035
[Exhales] Any time is good, really.
I don't have...

341
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,372
You don't have time 'cause you would
have to go out and get a proper gun.

342
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,374
Oh. No, no, no.

343
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,959
I have a gun. I actually keep one
right here in the drawer.

344
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,128
You got one right there?
I don't need to see it.

345
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,132
I like to keep it loaded because you never know
who's gonna walk into a law office these days.

346
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,676
[Laughing] Safety first.

347
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,220
- Right.
- So let's rethink some things.

348
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,222
[Clears Throat]

349
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,016
Let's say that you've
learned your lesson now,

350
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,352
and I've learned
a little lesson.

351
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,020
Hmm.
And we'll call it even,

352
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,856
and I will respectfully
decline the duel.

353
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,858
- Well, you can't decline.
- Eh?

354
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:11,279
As you know, once the duel's been accepted,
you know, there's no backing out.

355
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,949
I mean, that's the law.
Yup.

356
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,993
Anyway, great! This is settled.

357
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,996
And I was looking for something
to do tomorrow afternoon anyway.

358
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,291
So I'm gonna pencil you in for
high noon tomorrow. Don't do it.

359
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,128
- Don't do it.
- And, uh, don't worry...

360
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,757
'cause, um, wherever you are,
I'll find you.

361
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,468
- Yeah. - I'm gonna put one
right between your teeth.

362
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,263
And it's just gonna pop out the
back of your neck. [Clicks Tongue]

363
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,604
Hey, Deandra?
Can we talk to you for a sec?

364
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,149
Hey, you guys.
Watch me bust out this sweet jackknife.

365
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,865
- Oh! Whoa!
- [Gasps, Coughing]

366
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,451
- [Laughing] You guys!
- Are you okay?

367
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,120
- Oh, I biffed that one, huh?
- You "biffed" it?

368
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,539
Whoo! Thank God there wasn't
a baby in there, huh?

369
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,709
Could you get me a refill on that, guy?
What is this?

370
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,878
Piña colada. Been crushing them.
They're great in the heat.

371
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,047
Ah. I don't think you should
be drinking and swimming.

372
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,008
- No.
- Dingdong! Hello.

373
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,634
[Dee] Goddamn it.
Hello!

374
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,386
- Hi.
- No, no, no, no, no.

375
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,722
We're looking for Deandra Reynolds.
Oh, there she is.

376
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,725
Wait, wait. Don't do that. We're the wealthy
homosexual couple she promised her womb to.

377
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,103
Indeed, we are. I'm Hugh Honey, and
this is my partner, Vic Vinegar.

378
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,231
We're partners in real estate,
and we're partners in life.

379
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,901
[Dee Laughing] Oh, hi!

380
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,361
Oh, hey!
Oh, you guys!

381
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,490
How are you doing, sweetie?
Oh, excuse us for just one second.

382
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,116
Oh, boy.
It's good to see you.

383
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,619
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Do not ruin this for me!

384
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,039
Dee, relax. Okay? We're gonna start a bidding
war, drive up the price of your womb.

385
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,957
Why would I want you to drive
up the price of my womb?

386
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,543
If we make this couple desperate enough for
money, they'll sell their house to us.

387
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,921
We're buying every house in the neighborhood.
Yeah, check it out.

388
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,382
We get the house, you get a higher price for
that kid you're crapping out. Everybody wins.

389
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,135
We're merging the ideas. I didn't want
to merge the ideas in the first place.

390
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,513
Well, we're merging 'em,
so get used to it.

391
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,767
Uh, we're giving Deandra
$100,000 to carry a child for us.

392
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,061
Now, I'll be providing
the sperm, of course.

393
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,772
And I'll be providing the money because
I'm the breadwinner in the relationship.

394
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,857
And I'm the trophy husband.
He's my bottom.

395
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:14,611
Oh! I'm the power bottom.
Technically, I generate most of the power.

396
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,905
Only because I'm giving out
so much power from the top.

397
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,032
You need to generate power
to accept it.

398
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,493
- Deandra, what the hell are they
talking about? - I don't know.

399
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,954
Hey, Dee! Hey! Hey!

400
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,039
[Sean] Who's this guy?
Oh, splinter!

401
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,208
There's a gate, bro!
What the hell are you doing here?

402
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,210
Pardon me, ma'am, sir.

403
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,754
- Everything's fine 'cause Daddy's here now.
- Who are you?

404
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,633
I'm the father of the baby growing inside of
her stomach, and I need a safe place to hide.

405
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,177
What baby are you talking about, Charlie?
I'm not pregnant yet!

406
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,222
- [Crashing]
- Abort!

407
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,432
[Grunts]
Abort! Abort!

408
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,435
- Do not buy this house!
- There's a goddamn gate!

409
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,522
I just got done with that lawyer.
He threatened to sue me.

410
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,400
- What? Why? - Well, I had those
kids painting their room.

411
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,611
And then I told them to go down,
rip some copper pipes out.

412
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,531
Their little hands got all bloody.
Big deal.

413
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,701
And they- I had to give them
the house to settle the suit.

414
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,245
Okay, that's it. You all are crazy,
and I'm asking you to leave.

415
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,955
[Dee] Yes.
So, let's go.

416
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,207
Please leave.
Oh, are you sure? Really?

417
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,002
- This is a very inviting pool.
- You heard the guy! You heard him!

418
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:16,631
Oh, you two.
I am so sorry about that.

419
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,925
Boy, that was nuts, wasn't it?

420
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,927
Yeah.

421
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,388
You know, we're gonna have
to ask you to leave as well.

422
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,016
But what about the baby?

423
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,560
We're just gonna find someone else.
Oh, you guys!

424
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,689
You got me there! I thought you were serious.
We are serious, Deandra.

425
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,649
[Splashing]

426
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,986
Oh, this shit is like a bathtub.
[Mac] Jackknife!

427
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,033
Oh, yeah! Cannonball!

428
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,619
Whoo!
[Mac] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

429
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,038
- Oh, yeah!
