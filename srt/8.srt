00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,036
[ mac ]
come on.
Just one more race.

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,338
[ dennis ]
every time we race, you lose.
[ charlie ] you always lose.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,407
[ mac ]
one more race, and then
we'll go to the strip club.

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,409
All right.
Three, two, one.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,750
Goddamn it!
What is wrong with you?

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,652
Super slow drinker over here.
Do you have, like,
a little throat or something?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,554
Dennis. We gotta
get out of here now.
Why?

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,823
I just got off the phone
with dad. He wants
to stop by and talk to us.

9
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,526
What does dad want?
I don't know! Let's go before
we have to deal with this!

10
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,029
Let's get out of here before
you guys get around your father.

11
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,098
Let's just take care
of one more--
don't-- don't be grabby.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,135
Okay. Dennis,
I need to borrow $20.

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,137
What, dude?
Just give me
some money, man.

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,239
How come you don't
ever have any money?
Dee? Moneys?

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,741
- no way.
- what are you gonna do
at the strip club with--

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,943
Will you just get in the car!
No, no!

17
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,813
It sucks for me, 'cause
you guys get all the girls
and the attention!

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,482
My dad's gonna be here
in a second!
Will you get in the car!

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,484
No! I'm going home!
I'm going home.
Oh!

20
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,921
- can we go? Please!
- yeah, we can go.
We can go.

21
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,159
- dennis!
- oh, jesus!

22
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,029

24
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,032
[ dennis ]
what the hell
is wrong with you, dad?

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,534
Why would you come
sneaking around the bar
in the middle of the night?

26
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,237
You don't snoop and sneak
and appear in front of cars
and start yelling names!

27
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,140
- no!
- I had something
very important to tell you.

28
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,275
Really? What could be
so important it couldn't
wait till the morning?

29
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,612
There's nothing more important
than the fact that we just
hit our friend with a car.

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,583
Oh, yeah?
Try this on for size.
Your mother's dead.

31
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,785
No.
What?

32
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,221
Oh, my god!

33
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,992
No, she's not dead.
We're gettin' divorced though.

34
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,528
Why--
why--

35
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,063
What--
what--

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,565
- why would you say
that she's dead?
- that's a business tactic.

37
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,102
You drop the bomb,
then you soften the blow.
You never tried this?

38
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,007
That is a terrible
business tactic!
You are a horrible father.

39
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,109
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

40
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,946
I hate the kind of person
that your whore mother
turned me into.

41
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,916
The big house, the big car--
I'm giving it all away.

42
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,452
Hmm?
Giving it away how?

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,623
For starters, I'm giving all
my money to charity. Then I'm
gonna hang out with you two.

44
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,892
That's what this is all about--
spending time with my kids.

45
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,594
Hold on a second.
I wanna be the father
that I never was.

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,596
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Getting to know them.

47
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,532
What did you say
about the money?
Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,069
- I'm giving it all away.
- that is a very
stupid thing to do.

49
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,771
You're a very stupid,
stupid man. Who are you
gonna give it to?

50
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,341
I don't know.
Poor people.

51
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,609
Poor people?
Poor people?

52
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,712
What-- what is your prob--
okay, where's mom?

53
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,982
Mom? She's on vacation
banging one of the boys
she hangs out with.

54
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,520
Dennis, your mother
is a dirty, dirty whore.
Oh, goddamn it, dad!

55
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,589
First you force me
to run over my friend charlie.

56
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,658
And then you start talking
about mom like she's dead.

57
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,660
Now you're saying
she's a dirty whore?
The money.

58
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,096
You can't waltz back into
our lives and be our dad again!
And the money.

59
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,665
It doesn't work that way.
You can't just barge in!
And the money!

60
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,535
And the money!
My god, dad!
All of our money?

61
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,604
[ gasps ]

62
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,280
Well, that was awkward.

63
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,484
Yes, it was.
Sort of
a private conversation.

64
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,520
Very much a family type moment.
We didn't need to hear
any of that.

65
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,023
<i>Not for our ears.</i>

66
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,925
Wanna go
to the strip club?

67
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,194
¶ [ rock ]
I don't know.

68
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:53,499
I've been manically depressed
for the past couple of years.

69
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,670
I just feel like
I need a serious change,
or I'm gonna kill myself.

70
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,339
So when you say
you're giving your money away
to poor people,

71
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,575
Do you mean, like,
"mexico" poor, or can it be,
like, "me and charlie" poor?

72
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,580
Well, I haven't
given that much thought.
Put some thought into that one.

73
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,582
Consider that.
Yeah, man.
Give that some thought.

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,752
In the meantime,
you wanna get shit-faced, bro.
So I tell you what.

75
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,121
Before we get crazy
giving away our money here,

76
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,257
What do you say we buy
a couple of pitchers,

77
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,694
Maybe a few tequila shots,
a few rounds of kamikazes.

78
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,897
After that, we'll hit the town,
we'll tie on a serious buzz.
All right, bud?

79
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,233
Oh, my god!
You poor baby. What happened?

80
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,271
Uh, my best friend
ran me over with his car.

81
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,273
[ gasps ]
yeah.

82
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,009
Oh, my god!
That's terrible!
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,645
- do you want a lap dance?
- oh--

84
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,148
I don't have any money.
Oh!

85
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,150
I could give you one for free.

86
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,120
Really? Okay.
Okay.

87
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:51,056
<i>Oh, my god!</i>
<i>You poor baby.</i>
<i>What happened to you?</i>

88
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,593
His friend ran him over
with a car.
That is so sad.

89
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,895
I know.
I was gonna give him
a free lap dance.

90
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,897
She totally was.
I'll join you!

91
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,401
That's great!
Do one of you girls wanna
hook my boy up over here?

92
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,371
- he's really down in the dumps.
- okay!

93
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,639
No, no, no.
I don't-- I don't--
oh, come on, buddy!

94
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,975
You gotta do this, man!
Embrace it.
Get in the spirit.

95
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,977
This is gonna
cheer you up.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,918
Well, maybe just one.
[ all cheering ]

97
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,822
All right, frank! See?
That's the spirit
that beat the japanese!

98
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,426
God. Stupid dad!
Never gave me a goddamn thing.

99
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,996

What are you doing?

103
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,114
Same thing you're doing, dennis.
I'm not letting dad give
all this shit to poor people.

104
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,684
I got here first though.
I'm taking the plasma tv
and the fish tank.

105
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,153
How come you get
to pick and choose?
It's not that.

106
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,522
I'm a man and I'm strong.
I can carry heavy things.

You're a woman.
You're weak, and you can't.

108
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,494
You're a woman
and you're weak.
That doesn't make any sense.

109
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,697
You don't make any sense.
Great.
I'll tell you what.

110
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,300
Um, I'm gonna take all the stuff
that I want and load it
into my enormous s.U.V.,

111
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,004
And you can grab some trinkets
or whatever and throw it
in your tiny little car.

112
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,007
All right, look.
We don't need to be
doing this, okay?

113
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,743
You're my brother.
We're-- we're in
this thing together.

114
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,745
We don't need to make this
a competition.

115
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,747
Yeah.

116
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:26,485
You're right. A competition.
That's a good idea.
I'll make you a deal.

117
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,188
Whatever your feeble little arms
can carry out of here,
you can keep.

00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,257
And the rest is mine.

You hit me, charlie!
So what? So what?

00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,389
You are fast.
I was winning anyway.

This one's too heavy!
This one's too heavy!

You are freakishly fast!
Thanks.

Charlie, you got
any booze in here?

Yeah, yeah.
Check under my bed
or under one of my pillows.

Hey, guys,
I can't thank you enough.

So much.

Yeah, man.
Hey, you look great.
Make yourself at home.

Charlie, we gotta
get him out of here.
What? Why, dude?

136
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,013
Because there's two of them
and three of us!

137
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,015
Have a heart.
The guy's going through
a divorce.

Since when do you give a shit
about people?
Well, you know.

139
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,652
Maybe you should be
the one that leaves, okay?

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,654
Don't you roll away
when I'm talking to you.

141
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,756
I am the reason the girls
are here in the first place.
That is bullshit!

142
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,427
Do not ruin this!
Do not ruin this for me!
I'm not ruining anything!

143
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,296
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>What are you guys</i>
<i>fighting about?</i>

144
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,598
Nothing, man.
We're just having a--

145
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,835
Well, take it out in the hall.
You're ruining the vibe.

146
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,238
Okay. We'll go out in the hall.
Watch my-- watch my--
shut up!

147
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,508
Easy. Easy!
Your behavior
is unbelievable, man.

148
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,544
All right.
How are we gonna do this?
Okay.

149
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,348
Uh, let's flip a coin.
The loser leaves.
Great.

150
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,450
- okay, get a coin.
- I don't have a coin.

151
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,719
Why don't you--
give me a coin.
You have a coin?

152
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,687
Of course
I don't have a coin.
All right.

153
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,689
Let's flip something else.
All right. Um--

154
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,392
Something in the hallway,
like a feather.
Flip that, uh, piece of wood?

155
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,527
That's not gonna work.
What about something
off the chair?

156
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,529
Yeah. Maybe
we'll just break
something off the chair.

157
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,132
Break something-- don't--
don't break it too much.

158
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,034
No, that's not gonna work.
It's a rental, dude.

159
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,471
You know what? Frank's
got money. Let's ask him.
All right.

160
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,607
- it's locked.
- no. You gotta push it hard
'cause it sticks.

161
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,043
- I'm telling you, it's locked.
- bang again!

162
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,145
Frank!
Frank, open the door, dude!

163
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,147
Hey.
Oh.

164
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,449
You guys need to give me about
45 minutes in here, okay?

165
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,451
Here. Hey, charlie,
here's five dollars.

166
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,787
Go down to wawa,
pick me up a couple of sodas.

167
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,289
I got a feeling I'll be
pretty thirsty after this.

168
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,958
Yeah. Hey--

169
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,427
Oh--

170
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,397
Son of a bitch.

171
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,970
Over the line.
Over the line!

172
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,307
I'm-- I'm <i>on</i> the line.
On the line is over the line.
Get your foot on your side.

173
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,109
Which side? This one?
Is this the side?

174
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,778
No.
This the side
you're talking about?

175
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,714
Get-- all right.
You know what?
Oh, what is this?

176
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,716
Do you recognize this lamp?

177
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,252
Where'd you get that?
I think this is the lamp
dad got you in china.

178
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,254
Give it back to me.
As I recall, yeah.

179
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,256
Give me my lamp back.
Must have gotten this
out of your room.

180
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,625
Well, it's mine.
Let me put it
on your side for you.

181
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,229
You s--
oh, that is a shame.

182
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,231
No, that's fine.
I don't care.
It slipped.

183
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,767
Yeah. By the way,
I wanted to
show you something...

184
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,803
My feeble little arms
were able to carry.

185
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,405
By all means.

186
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,709
Mr. Tibbs.
<i>Oh, is that it?</i>

187
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,312
Is that mr. Tib--
is that what they call you?
They call you mr. Tibbs?

188
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,982
What do they
call you now?
Whatever.

189
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,053
I don't care.
[ gasping softly ]
[ door opens ]

190
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,656
Hey-o!

191
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,658
[ grunts ]
what's up, bitches?

192
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,028
- what?
- dennis, you would not believe
how great this thing is.

193
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,065
People give you free shit, and
women treat you like a puppy
they found out on the street.

194
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,067
Really?
Yeah.
Dude, I was thinking.

195
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,636
You pick up
one of these bad boys,
we head down to the mall.

196
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,573
There's a ton of talent
down there. We've been
looking for a new angle.

197
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,743
That does sound like fun.
Yeah.
Yeah, that'll work.

198
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,446
Oh, I'm sorry, dee.
We're putting ourselves into
the shoes of the unfortunate,

199
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,548
See what their world's like,
maybe gain a little perspective.

200
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,052
- what do you do?
- I don't take advantage
of people.

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,024
Oh!
Look at sweet dee sitting
on her cloud of judgment,

202
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,027
Handing down life lessons
to all the sinners.

203
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,397
Come on, mac.
Let's go get crippled.

204
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,137
Charlie.

205
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,006
Charlie, buddy, buddy, buddy.
Charlie.
Oh, my god, I'm cold.

206
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:46,045
We gotta talk, charlie.
Uh-- oh, yeah, frank.
We have to talk.

207
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,580
Last night was
one of the greatest nights
of my whole life.

208
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,384
I'm sure it was.
I used to live like this
in squalor and filth,

209
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,554
Always trying to get over
on people, scamming my way
through situations.

210
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:59,058
Wow! I don't care!
I wanna live
like you again, charlie.

211
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,895
I wanna be
pathetic and desperate
and ugly and hopeless.

212
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,297
I am not ugly.
This is the change
I've been looking for.

213
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,299
I wanna move in with you.
Are you out--

214
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,602
Are you out of your damn mind,
dude? You made me sleep
out in the hall.

215
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,105
You ignored
my cries for help
in the middle of the night.

216
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,841
I'll pay for your rent
for six months.
Twelve.

217
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,675
Six.
Ten.

218
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,343
Six.
Nine.

219
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,110
Six.
Ten.

220
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,111
Six.
Twelve.

221
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:19,945
Four.
Six.

222
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,014
Deal.
All right.

223
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,083
No more sleeping
out in the hall though.
I can't promise that.

224
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,984
Let's get ready.
All right.
Where are you taking me?

225
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,287
We're going back
to the strip club.
All right. Strip club--

226
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,789
[ screams ]
dude! My legs!
Hold on a second.

227
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,459
This is going to be
like shooting fish
in a barrel for us.

228
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,994
It's gonna be awesome.
What's your backstory?

229
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,732
What do you mean?
Bro, your backstory.
How'd your legs get crippled?

230
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,501
I don't know.
All right, check mine out.
I had polio. Okay?

231
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,970
That's why I'm rocking
the f.D.R. Look with
the blanket and everything.

232
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,674
See, I got a problem.
My legs are really
muscular and athletic.

233
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,909
So nobody's gonna believe
that they're dead.
Okay?

234
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,178
This way, with the blanket,
everyone will assume
that underneath,

235
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,180
My legs are withered
and useless.

236
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,317
Huh.
That's a good idea.
Bro, it's brilliant.

237
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,319
Yeah.
I have polio too.

238
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,022
You can't have polio.
That's my disease.
You gotta pick your own disease.

239
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,724
Yeah, but I want polio.
Well, you can't have it.

240
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,726
What the hell is this?

241
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,463
Are you sure you're okay?

242
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,533
It's really important
that I do this myself.

243
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,736
You are so brave.
[ chuckles ]

244
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,210
[ chuckles ]

245
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,547
I got it!
All by myself, I did it.

246
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,083
Yeah, you did.
That's awesome.

247
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,257
Goddamn it.

248
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,427
What are we gonna do now?
We can't go back in there.
Everybody's desensitized.

249
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,529
All right, look.
We'll go down
to crate and barrel.

250
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,665
- maybe we can find
some cougars or something.
- hey, guys!

251
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,401
Shit!
What do we do?
What do we do?

252
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,503
Uh, okay.
Just play it cool, man.
Play it cool.

253
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,039
Play it cool.

254
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,374
Hey.
Hey.

255
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,309
How's it going?
I have polio.

256
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,111
Oh.

257
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:04,350
Uh-- okay.

258
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:10,656
And I have polio--
he has polio too.

259
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,429
Mm-hmm.

260
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,366
All right.
Um--

261
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,385
So if you wanna shower,
you gotta shower in the bar.
Shower in the bar?

262
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,387
Yeah.
Shower in the sink.
In the sink?

263
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,823
Yeah. You never showered
in a sink bef--
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh--

264
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,825
What?
Oh, my god!

265
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,727
Do you see that?
What?

266
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,898
I got a good idea.
I think I know how we can really
up our game at the strip club.

267
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,967
How?

268
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:59,405
Who gets more respect
and admiration in
this country than war heroes?

269
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,640
Athletes.
Yeah, that's true.

270
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,642
But after that.
Rock stars.

271
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,844
Yeah, also true.
But after that, frank.
Actors.

272
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,513
Yeah-- right.
Models.

273
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,014
Yes. Look--
rich people.

274
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,316
Okay, look, look, look!
If you just buy me this costume,

275
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm gonna show these ladies
a war hero they can't
take their eyes off of.

276
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,022
I don't think
this costume's gonna work.

277
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,258
No, this costume--
the chicks are gonna
go crazy over this.

278
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,593
Maybe you should let me
do all the talking.

279
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,595
It's gonna be like fish
in a barrel. I got it covered.
Okay.

280
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,098
Just watch--
watch and learn.
Oh, look at you, sweetie.

281
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,233
What happened?

282
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,769
Viet-goddamn-nam's
what happened!

283
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,105
Go get me a beer, bitch!

284
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,741
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

285
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,043
Hey, that was working.
Let me do the talking.

286
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,046
I'll take it from here.
Did you just box me in?

287
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,152
You don't do that
to a guy, frank.
You don't box in a vet!

288
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,988
<i>You don't stick a vet</i>
<i>in the corner, frank!</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

289
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,990
He's a little
loosey-goosey upstairs.

290
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,994
I try to get him out
as much as possible.
It's very difficult.

291
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,665
Is he your--
boy. He's my poor
little crippled boy.

292
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh, that's so sad.
Mmm.

293
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,737
I didn't fight no damn war
so I could be boxed in...

294
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:08,173
By some square commie-ass
piece of shit!

295
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,209
Well, I feel awful.

296
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,845
Well, that's what happens
when you meet
an actual crippled person.

297
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,847
Brings you down.
Yeah, disabled.

298
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,849
Whatever, dude.
Crippled, disabled--
I don't care, man!

299
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,051
I just wanna get out of here.
This whole thing's ruined.
I know!

300
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,320
We should, because,
you know, you weren't
pulling it off anyway.

301
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:25,057
Hold on a second.
Don't pull that shit
with me, okay?

302
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,826
I didn't ruin this.
You ruined this.
How did I ruin it?

303
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,362
I had a good polio backstory
that the chicks
were gonna totally dig--

304
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,931
Nobody cares about polio
or backstories or--
you know what?

305
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,434
I bet you a million dollars
if I had talked to a girl--
for god's sakes!

306
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,970
About my withered legs,
then--
a million dollars?

307
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,873
All right.
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

308
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,778
I think that there's only
one true way to settle this
like gentlemen.

309
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,515
You're dead!

310
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,652
Hey!

311
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,859
No! No!

312
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,429
Oh, yeah, baby!
You cheated!
You cheated!

313
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,030
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!

314
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,232
You suck!
All you do is cheat!

315
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,668
How do you feel about that,
huh?

316
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,770
How do you feel
about that?
What are you doing?

317
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,139
You're just a sore loser!

318
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,544
What's going on
down there?

319
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,747
Those two guys
are pretending to be disabled
and kicking each other's asses.

320
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,186
What a bunch of scumbags.
[ scoffs ]

321
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,633
Being handicapped sucks, dude.
Oh, yeah, man.
It's too much work.

322
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,136
There's, like, nothing
to show for it, man.
There's no advantages.

323
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,138
Oh, look at this guy.
Hey.
Another homeless guy?

324
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,673
Hey, buddy.
Hey, pal, wake up.

325
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,675
Hey.
Charlie?

326
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,677
What the hell are you doing?
What time is it?

327
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,679
Why are you
dressed like that, dude?
Yeah.

328
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,681
What is going on?
Why are you sleeping out here?

329
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:59,218
Because I can't sleep in there!
I can't get
onto the stupid curb!

330
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,853
Why would you wanna
sleep in there?

331
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,888
Your dad keeps swooping in,
taking my chicks...

332
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,258
And locking me
out of my apartment!

333
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,428
Okay. Well, we were gonna
go inside and get drunk.
You wanna come with us?

334
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,930
No. Look at me.
I got a whole thing
going on, man.

335
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,233
What-- really?
Yeah. I'm going to the strip--
don't touch that.

336
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,671
I'm going to the strip club.
I'm gonna get some girls--
with this?

337
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:22,207
I mean-- yeah, with this!
I mean, the whole thing is--
this is good as gold.

338
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,677
Frank keeps coming in.
He swoops in,
he takes my chicks.

339
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,212
He doesn't care about me.
What kind of a guy does that?

340
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,083
Who comes into
someone's apartment
and just kicks him out?

341
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,585
Like I'm a piece of crap.
Like I belong on the street.

342
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,021
Like I'm some kind
of piece of dirt.
That's bullshit, man!

343
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,190
War hero coming through.

344
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:42,127
How you doing?
War hero.
So... Kind of a big deal.

345
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,897
I'm a war hero.
How do you--
hey, how you doin'?

346
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,466
I'm a war hero.
So I'll catch up with you.

347
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,768
All right.
Okay. All right.

348
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,571
Hey, war hero.
So--

349
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,543
All right. All right.
Maybe hit the gym a little bit.
What the hell?

350
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,712
Yeah!
[ hooting, shouting ]

No! No!

353
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,556
Charlie! Hey,
this is my roommate, charlie.

354
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,558
Girls, say hello
to charlie.
No!

355
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,561
<i>[ girls ]</i>
<i>hi, charlie!</i>
<i>No! No!</i>

No, frank!
Come here! Come here!

358
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,740
What-- what is this shit?
Well, it's just--

359
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,742
I rigged it up.
It's like--

360
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,944
I'm really using my hands,
but they don't know it.

361
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:35,080
No, frank! What are you
doing with the strippers?
You're stealing my thing!

362
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,283
What? Well,
I figured, you know,
I'd cut out the middleman.

363
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,285
This way, everybody wins.

364
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,421
I don't win.

365
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,690
The other thing I figured out
is the only thing...

366
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:48,927
That attracts
the attention of strippers
more than pity is money.

367
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,929
And I brought
a shitload of that.

368
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,433
[ cackling ]

I'm gonna kill you!

You're totally blowing up
my scene here, man!
Are you crazy?

370
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,804
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me,
and you're ruining it!

371
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,740
It's a win-win situation.
No! You come to my apartment!
You lock me out!

372
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,676
Take all my girls!
It's not a win-win situation!

373
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,978
My thumb's on your neck.
Why can't you just
give me this?

374
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,047
I'm gonna kill you.
This guy's a walker!

375
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,716
But I love the guy, all right?

376
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:14,353
He's family, you know?
I mean, we've been through
a lot together.

377
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:18,957
Okay? So, you know,
is it wrong for me to love him?
I don't know.

378
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,227
If I have to listen to you
talk about this stupid,

in the head.

381

Hey! Mr. Tibbs was not
just some stupid stuffed
element-- elephant, okay?

382
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:36,041
He was like a companion.

Let's go--

Let's go to the strip club.

that somebody in your condition
could have so much energy.
