1
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:02,769
<i>Hey, guys. Here we go.</i>

2
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:04,170
- <i>I'm ordering it.</i>
<i>- Drop the bluff, Dee.</i>

3
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,789
<i>No one believes</i>
<i>you're in an actual movie.</i>

4
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:07,914
You guys are gonna feel hella
stupid when you see me

5
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:10,639
acting in a feature film.
"Hella." Are we saying "hella" now?

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,144
'Cause I like it.
No, we're not saying "hella," okay?

7
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,664
No.
Nobody's saying "hella" anymore.

8
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:16,466
I never really got to say it.
"Hella" came and went. Me, neither.

9
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,101
Dee, can we watch
something else?

10
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,136
Can we watch, like,
a superhero movie or something?

11
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:22,105
This is such a waste of our...

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,641
Oh, that's a nice opening shot.
Symmetrical vista.

13
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,059
It's beautiful.

14
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:28,311
Directed by Pedro Vyes. Who's he?

15
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:30,196
He's, like, this foreign
art house director.

16
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:32,982
Oh. Ooh...
Foreign director. Very impressive.

17
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:34,770
Okay, you guys, be quiet.
This is my scene.

18
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:36,722
Pretty early for a whiskey.

19
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:38,774
Or pretty late.

20
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,809
Why don't you make it a double.

21
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:44,146
Oh, yeah? A little hair
of the dog that bit you?

22
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,731
<i>Yeah, Dee,</i>

23
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:47,399
I got to hand it to you.
Y-You've been talking

24
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:51,416
about doing this for years,
and... Is that Richard Grieco?

25
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:55,040
Hi.

26
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:57,076
Aw, Grieco. I love that
guy. Where's he been?

27
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:59,328
Richard Grieco
is in an art house movie?

28
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:02,054
That seems odd. That's a little strange.
Yeah, it's a little stra...

29
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,383
But, you know, they-they always
got to get some kind of a name

30
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:06,969
- in order to finance the mo...
Oh, now he's being blown. - Right.

31
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:12,474
Okay. Now-now this makes sense.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,060
So, Dee, you clearly made a porn.
This is a porno!

33
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:17,146
What? No? It's not
a porn. You guys,

34
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:20,099
the-the foreigners, they have
a much more evolved view of sex.

35
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:21,433
This is... this is art.

36
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:26,321
Dee, what channel
did you order this from?

37
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:27,239
Cinemax.

38
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,690
Cinemax?!

39
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,859
Dee, Cinemax doesn't make art.

40
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:34,279
You guys, Pedro is-is
an edgy, foreign director.

41
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,447
Where's he from?

42
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:37,366
Puerto Rico.
Oh!

43
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:38,500
Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico?
Puerto Rico!

44
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:40,285
Oh, man.

45
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:43,088
Dee, you made a Skinemax flick
with a Puerto Rican pervert.

46
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:45,290
Congratulations. Good thing
you got us all together.

47
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,843
Listen, hey, I did
not make a smut film.

48
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:49,545
Gobble that cock.

49

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,659
<i>Now, why is Grieco</i>

51
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,294
resorting to Skinemax?

52
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,930
He's got a great career.
He's doing fine.

53
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,380
Actually, it makes sense.
I mean,

54
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,248
erotic films
are very, very in right now.

55
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,050
I mean, Grieco probably didn't
realize he was doing a porn.

56
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:25,502
I think he thought
he was doing the next

57
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:26,886
<i>Fifty Shades</i>
<i>of Grey</i> or whatever.

58
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:27,804
I mean, it's a...
it's a fine line

59
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,306
these days between art and smut.

60
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,507
It really is.
Art's a tricky thing.

61
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,592
The whole art world
is bullshit nowadays.

62
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:35,011
I mean, like, anything can be
considered art. I'll bet you

63
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,847
Charlie's doodlings could be
considered art by some people.

64
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:41,234
Well, that's 'cause my drawings
<i>are</i> art.

65
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,603
You're not an artist, dude.
You're drawing with chalk.

66
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:45,855
No, I'm drawing with marker
and, like, pen and stuff.

67
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:47,023
I'm just eating the chalk.

68
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,525
Charlie, don't eat chalk.

69
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:49,526
Well, it settles my stomach.

70
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:50,610
My stomach's a little...

71
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,028
If your stomach hurts,
eat a Tums.

72
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:53,747
What's the difference?
One is chalk!

73
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:54,998
Well, I don't like wasting Tums.

74
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,583
Tums is very good to draw with.

75
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,034
This maniac is an artist?

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,536
I'll bet you if I hung one

77
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,787
of Charlie's doodles
in a modern art gallery,

78
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,038
people would not know
the difference.

79
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:03,873
Mm. No. No, I disagree.

80
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:06,042
No, art has to come
from a more meaningful place.

81
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,711
It can't just be silly nonsense.

82
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:09,045
I mean, take my erotic memoirs,

83
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:11,047
for example.

84
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,550
Now, that was art.
That was smut.

85
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,468
No, dude, what I do is art.
And you know what else?

86
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,687
I think I should film it.
Yeah.

87
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,473
I mean, guys, I'd be a fool not
to ride this erotic tidal wave

88
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,392
our culture seems to be on,
film it,

89
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,811
do the next<i> Fifty Shades</i>
<i>of Grey,</i> my style, you know?

90
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,946
My film would be real,
it would be tasteful,

91
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,565
it would be...
it would be subtle.

92
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,367
It wouldn't be some goddamn
Puerto Rican smut.

93
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:33,486
I'm down to try this, like,
art gallery idea of yours.

94
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,488
What do you think
Grieco would do?

95
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:37,374
He wouldn't eat chalk.

96
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:47,300
Yes, but I just don't understand
why you're choosing

97
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:49,169
to dress like Richard Grieco.

98
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:51,471
Well, because he's a cool bro
and I'm a cool bro.

99
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,506
I just want to do a Grieco
thing. I'm vibing with it.

100
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,425
I'm vibing with it, man. Stop saying
that you're vibing and "bro."

101
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:57,143
You know what, why don't you go
mingle, and Frank and I

102
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:58,762
will handle this. Thank you.
All right, you do it.

103
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,814
All right, Frank. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Leave him alone.

104
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,599
Look, here's a spot. Here's a spot.
What?

105
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,768
Yeah.
Just keep... keep an eye out.

106
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,521
Okay.

107
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,273
That's good. That's good.
Mmm.

108
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,242
Oh, yeah. Looks perfect.

109
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:14,911
Oh, wow. I like this one.
Oh.

110
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,614
That's art. That's art. I like that piece.
Yes, that's...

111
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,838
She's going for it.

112
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:27,624
She loves it.

113
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,510
She loves it.
She's going for it.

114
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,512
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the
hell are you doing? Whoa. Hey, lady. Lady.

115
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,380
You can't throw
art in the trash.

116
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,549
Oh, that wasn't art.
It was garbage.

117
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,468
Wait, wait, wait a second.
Wait a second.

118
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I mean, how-how is that art

119
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,772
and this is trash?
I mean, who's to say, really?

120
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:45,024
Well, I'm to say.
It's my gallery.

121
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,693
Okay. Then please explain to me

122
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:48,027
how that is art

123
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,395
and this is garbage.

124
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,448
Well, it's all about context.

125
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,484
The story behind each piece
is part of what endows it

126
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:56,536
with meaning.
For example, this artist

127
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,321
worked for 30 years

128
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:00,657
before finally finding
his voice.

129
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:03,076
He left his home
when he was a boy

130
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,629
to escape the Nazis,
fled to Paris,

131
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,632
and painted the poor children
he saw in the streets.

132
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,054
The
ambiguity he uses to paint children

133
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,058
and animals.

134
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,144
His work provokes.

135
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,480
It raises questions.

136
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:24,814
Are we children?

137
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,900
Are we animals?

138
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:31,571
<i>Are children animals?</i>

139
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,866
If it's context

140
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,951
you want... Context. Okay.

141
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:48,621
Well, the artist that did this,
his life is, like, total shit.

142
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,874
I mean, like, way worse
than this Nazi painter.

143
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,876
Oh. Hey, Charlie?

144
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,928
Yeah, uh... What-what
are you doing, man?

145
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:57,630
What's up, bro?
Hey, uh,

146
00:05:57,716 --> 00:06:00,433
this is Charlie. He's the,
uh... he's the artist.

147
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,136
C-Could you tell the lady
how your... Don't do that.

148
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,805
Okay, can you just explain to
her how your life is garbage

149
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,724
so that she... It's not sw...
Oh, my life's pretty sweet, bro.

150
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,609
Hang out at a bar all day
with my bros.

151
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:12,061
You know? Go on lots of
adventures. I'm really kind of

152
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:14,113
a sweet businessman
when I think about it.

153
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,901
He's an illiterate janitor whose
mother tried to abort him in...

154
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:20,820
Frank, Frank, tell her, please.
Huh?

155
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:21,955
What is it?

156
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,374
What-what is it?

157
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,876
It's-it's what we discussed. It's
what we've been discussing. Oh.

158
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:29,379
Tell her that Charlie's life
is a piece of shit. Please.

159
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,297
Thank you. I've got one of
those hella sweet lives...

160
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,498
Stop saying "hella"!
He doesn't...

161
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:33,967
he doesn't normally
say "hella."

162
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,668
I don't know where
he picked this up.

163
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,221
I'm sorry. I'm just not interested.
Okay,

164
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:39,505
well, wait, wait, we just need to take
one... I'm not interested, either.

165
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,174
I go for more
of the Pam Anderson type,

166
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,259
you know what I mean?
Oh, my God. Okay, look...

167
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,145
I'm not interested. Goddamn it.
Why did I even bring you two?

168
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,901
"A man enters.

169
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:55,605
"The room wouldn't be the
only thing he'd enter that day.

170
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,491
His name was Dennis."

171
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,410
I'm-I'm sorry--
what is happening?

172
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:01,527
"Silence."
Okay.

173
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,613
"He said. 'A woman's mouth

174
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,448
"'is not for the exiting
of words

175
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,118
"but for the entrance
of a man's... dick.'

176
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,956
"And then he did
put it in there.

177
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:14,958
In her mouth, I mean."

178
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,709
Okay.

179
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:19,295
And then they-they have sex
all over the library.

180
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,632
Okay, I, uh,

181
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,597
I-I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening here.

182
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,219
You must think
I'm somebody else.

183
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:28,554
Look, look. Sure, I could
leave here right now,

184
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,807
I could take this to Frank
and he would finance it.

185
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,442
But he's gross, you know?

186
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,811
He's basically, like,
the Cinemax of humans.

187
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,336
Okay, I think I'm catching up
here. So you want to make a film

188
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,449
based on the pornographic book
you're reading from.

189
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:42,902
Look... this is my
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey,</i> lady.

190
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:45,488
All right? Was the guy
who wrote that gross?

191
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,656
It was written by a woman.

192
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,876
Na... You... no, I know.

193
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,494
That it was written by a woman.

194
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,246
Everybody knows that.

195
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,081
Yeah, but that's why you needed
to let me get to the...

196
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,500
This was also written
by a woman. Yeah.

197
00:07:57,552 --> 00:08:00,253
Writ-Written and to be
directed by...

198
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,005
my sister.

199
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,425
What do you think?

200
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:09,646
Hey, Dee.

201
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,981
Dee, you're not doing
anything that matters, right?

202
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,933
You know, I think I'm
finally figuring out

203
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,602
this editing software, and I
have to say I put together

204
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,855
a pretty prime-time
acting reel here.

205
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,024
I doubt it.
Don't show it to me. I don't...

206
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:28,114
Pretty early for a whiskey.

207
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,199
A little hair of the dog
that bit you?

208
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,001
Using a multi-tiered distribu...

209
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:33,086
Multi-level marketi...

210
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,370
The Invigaron system.

211
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,924
Brains.

212
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,461
It i...

213
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:42,595
it's missing something,
isn't it?

214
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,047
Nah, it's great.

215
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,292
Uh, Dee, you know what I think

216
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,632
the real problem, though,

217
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:48,301
with the acting business is?
Uh-huh?

218
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,553
Every actor these days
is a multi-hyphenate.

219
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:51,888
They're doing everything--
they're writing,

220
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,356
they're directing, you know.

221
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,525
Mm.
So here's a thought I just had.

222
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,777
How would you like to, um,

223
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,896
direct my erotic memoirs?

224
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,481
I've always wanted to direct.

225
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:02,815
And you want me to do it?

226
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,200
Yeah, yeah.
Smart.

227
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:06,536
Smart. You bring
a female perspective in.

228
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,531
Mm-hmm. It's a very interesting layer.
I like that.

229
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,289
Yeah, it's-it's a good layer.
That's really smart of you.

230
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,708
Yeah, I'll do that.
I'll do that for you.

231
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,543
Okay, so, um... great.

232
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,828
So you'll do that, and, um...
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:19,382
now we just need a star that we
can attach on-on short notice.

234
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:22,418
Don't worry, I got... I got
an idea. I got a lot of ideas.

235
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,365
All right, what about
this one? You know,

236
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,451
I had a dream about, um,
you know, boiled eggs.

237
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:44,255
So, I, uh... Okay. What do
the...what do the eggs represent?

238
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:46,708
Eggs, you know? Like,
uh... from a chicken.

239
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,627
Just eggs? No.
Charlie, you're not getting it.

240
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,380
I need you to draw something
that's profound, you know?

241
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,298
That comes from someplace deep.

242
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:57,051
But is also childlike
and stupid, to prove my point.

243
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,220
Hey, bro, uh, maybe stop telling
me what to do all the time,

244
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:01,556
you know? 'Cause if you tell
me what to do, then, like,

245
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,358
you know, that's, like,
I got, like, a lame,

246
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:04,726
kind of square dude telling me

247
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,394
what to do, you
know? And that's

248
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,199
not really where art comes from.
Okay, you...

249
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:10,398
And so I'm gonna draw eggs
that represent eggs, bro.

250
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,367
And it's gonna... it's
gonna be hella cool, man.

251
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,701
You're gonna like these eggs.

252
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:14,702
Can I ask you a question?
Do you... do you

253
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,070
want to sell this art or not?

254
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,372
Bro, is this about
making money for you

255
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,906
or is it about
proving your point?

256
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,519
Like, I don't even
know what it is, man.

257
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,626
It's becoming about both
for me. I don't know

258
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:22,660
what it's becoming for you.

259
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:23,745
Come on, man.

260
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,246
I'm ripping this up.

261
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:26,297
I'm ripping this up.
That's it.

262
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,298
Bro, stop ripping up
my art, man!

263
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,250
Get in there!
Hey.

264
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:31,219
You stink!
Ugh.

265
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:33,755
I found him turning tricks
in the scrap metal yard.

266
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,757
Good news, Charlie. We're
gonna use Cricket now.

267
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:38,926
Oh. Use me how?
Use what part of me?

268
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,729
Relax. You are gonna be
the face of Charlie's art.

269
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,598
What? Why, man?

270
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,266
Because he's got, like,
the worst life imaginable,

271
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,185
and that's clearly
what those people want.

272
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,936
That's true, I do have the worst life.

273
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,271
You know what, Cricks, why
don't you come over here,

274
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,440
why don't you tell Charlie
what to draw.

275
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:54,025
Okay. Tell me wh... I don't
want to draw his drawings.

276
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,027
No, Charlie,
this is gonna work, all right?

277
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,072
Just jump on board,
jump on board. Okay, go ahead.

278
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,248
All right, bro... bro.

279
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,617
Oh, all right, fine.

280
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,286
Talk to me, brother.

281
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:06,421
What's up?

282
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,340
What is he doing?

283
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:10,792
He's doing, like,
a Grieco thing.

284
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,093
Okay. Uh, all right.

285
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:13,761
Well, what do you
want to hear about?

286
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,463
You want to hear
about a... dog orgy

287
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:17,181
or when a cat bit off my toe?

288
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:18,299
Dog orgy, brother.

289
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:19,383
Dog orgy. Okay.

290
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:20,852
This is going great.

291
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:22,637
Okay, now, Frank, I need you

292
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,722
to go talk to that gallery
owner. Convince her to come

293
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,049
to Paddy's for an art opening
that we're gonna have here.

294
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,026
Oh. You know? Flash
a little cash.

295
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,813
Pretend you're, like,
a high-society art type.

296
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,949
Oh, I got this. I-I used to hang
with an art crowd in the '70s.

297
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,984
I know these people.

298
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:40,738
O-Okay. All right. But-but...
play it subtle, all right?

299
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:42,623
Subtle. Yeah.

300
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,993
Frank. Play it subtle.
I got it.

301
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,546
Subtle.

302
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,632
Hello!
Hello?

303
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:54,635
Ango Gablogian,
the art collector.

304
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,671
Charmed, I'm sure.

305
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:59,223
Yes.
I'm gonna invite you to a show.

306
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:00,842
Okay.
But first...

307
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:03,511
allow me to destroy
your gallery.

308
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,012
Bullshit.

309
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,982
Bullshit.

310
00:12:08,017 --> 00:12:10,518
Derivative.

311
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,154
That... I love.

312
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,157
I absolutely love.

313
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,993
Um, that's just
the air conditioner.

314
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,495
I want it.

315
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,996
It's everything.

316
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,998
I mean, look at us.

317
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,667
We're just air conditioners.
I mean, after all,

318
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,587
we're just walking around
on the planet, breathing,

319
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:31,589
conditioning the air.

320
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:33,925
I condition it hot,

321
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,093
that conditions it cold.

322
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:38,546
I mean, it's symbiotic, no?

323
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:40,715
No, it is. I mean, we're
just the air conditioners

324
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,216
walking around on this planet,

325
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,385
screwing each
other's brains out.

326
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:47,054
So true. I never
thought of it like that.

327
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:53,110
Oh... hello, you.

328
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,487
This room won't be
the only thing

329
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,071
that I'll be entering today.

330
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:05,490
- Hey, teach.
- Cut!

331
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:09,343
A woman's mouth is not
for exiting of words,

332
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,280
but for the entrance
of a man's penis.

333
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:14,565
- Cut!
- Grieco, Grieco, Grieco, come on, man.

334
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,684
Shoot her tits. I need some...
I need a couple... Just...

335
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,487
Get mostly tits on this
one. Lots of emotion.

336
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,939
And I want to feel
a<i> little</i> bit of, uh,

337
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,776
of sadness coming from
your tits. And, action.

338
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,112
- A woman's mouth...
- Cut!

339
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,082
"Not for the exiting of words,
it's for the entrance..."

340
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,667
- Dee, can you just let him...
- Is there really...

341
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,418
is there really a frigging
difference between "exiting"

342
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:36,754
and "entering"? Hey! Excuse me, every...
You know what?

343
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,706
Is there a difference between
"exiting" and "entering"?

344
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,375
I know there is, but is there...
but words exit.

345
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,928
Okay, okay, you know what?
I-I need a seaweed break.

346
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,763
Grieco, you've had 15
packages of seaweed today.

347
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:47,209
Guys, Richard needs
a seaweed five.

348
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,599
Another...?
Oh, goddamn it!

349
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,051
Can we just get
the scene, please?

350
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,219
Just like it was in high school?

351
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:52,687
You know, about that.

352
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,162
What exactly happened
in high school?

353
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,904
'Cause it sounds like
you had sex with a teacher.

354
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:58,841
Uh, well no, she wasn't a teacher,
she was a hot young librarian.

355
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,449
Are you talking about Miss Clinsky?
Yeah.

356
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:02,947
She was like 50.
Yeah, she looked good for her age.

357
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,058
She looked like Rick Moranis.

358
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,983
Moranis was always in
pretty good shape, yeah.

359
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:07,902
Plus, when she took
her hair out of the bun,

360
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:09,737
she went from Moranis to Alanis.

361
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:11,289
Gross. You were 14.

362
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,241
So, technically, you were raped.

363
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:15,960
It wasn't rape. Can't rape a guy.
Huh?

364
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,745
You can't rape...
I was... I was willing.

365
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,664
You know, you can't
rape... I mean, it's cool.

366
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,582
Like, I bedded an older
woman. That's cool.

367
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:23,918
Right, Grieco?
You know what?

368
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,554
Let me use your pain in the scene.
What are you talking about?

369
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,005
You can't use somebody
else's pain, Grieco.

370
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:29,423
Do you know how acting works?

371
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,808
Look...

372
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:33,344
Touch my finger...

373
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:36,264
- and transfer your pain into me.
Mm-hmm, it's a good idea.

374
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,065
Touch... touch my finger. I'm
not touching your finger, man.

375
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:39,934
I'm not touching your finger!
Dennis.

376
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:42,603
Seriously, touch my finger. What
the hell is...? You know what?

377
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:44,739
Why don't you just shoot
me doing the goddamn scene?

378
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:46,490
I'll seduce the librarian.

379
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,859
You know what? That seaweed's
making me a little sick.

380
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:51,696
Uh, can I get a chalk break,
or something like that? Uh-oh.

381
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:01,872
I call this one
"Dog Three-Way."

382
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,675
'Cause I was recently
in a dog three-way.

383
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,927
Actually, four with
me, so, four-way.

384
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,512
I was in a dog orgy.

385
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:10,931
God, he's making a mockery
of my art, bro.

386
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,300
- Oh.
- Well,

387
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:13,851
the shoot was a total disaster.

388
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,856
Dee's incompetent
and a bitch, which we all knew.

389
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:17,305
But, I mean, Richard Grieco.

390
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,140
The man is obsessed
with seaweed. It's...

391
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,309
Pump your brakes.
You met Grieco?

392
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:22,693
Yeah, I met Grieco.
Yeah, he-he was in my movie,

393
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,278
but, uh, it didn't go very well.

394
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,480
What-what are you doing?
Are you doing a Grieco thing?

395
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,482
Yeah, I'm doing a Grieco thing,
'cause-'cause Grieco's the man.

396
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:30,818
You know, is he the man?
No, not really.

397
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,370
Ah, he used to be big.
No. Yeah, no.

398
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,489
Hello, boys.

399
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,792
Is that how you play it?
That is way over the top.

400
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,544
What are you talking about? This
is it. This is the way they are.

401
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,965
Frank, did you buy an air conditioner?
Yes, and I bought a painting for 35 K.

402
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:48,169
Why? Because I liked it,
and that's what it cost.

403
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,920
Is nobody understanding what we're
trying to do?

404
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:51,555
I am trying to prove
that this is all bullshit,

405
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:53,041
and you guys are all
buying into it.

406
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,642
Oh. Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Oh, hi.

407
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:57,478
Hi.
Here's the darling.

408
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,730
Oh.
That sold me...

409
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:01,599
not a painting.

410
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,401
Mm.
A revelation.

411
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,519
Oh. Hi, Ango.
Oh, oh.

412
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:06,987
Mm.  Oh.
Oh, great.

413
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,572
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Ango.

414
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:10,274
Yes. Thank you very much.

415
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,193
And thank you for coming.
Oh. Oh, my pleasure.

416
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:13,694
Yes, we have... we
have many paintings by

417
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,579
our featured artist,
Rickety Cricket. Ah...

418
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:17,281
Okay, well, Ango
clearly has a great eye.

419
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,866
I do have a great eye.

420
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,868
So I'm excited
to see what you have.

421
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,753
Yes, yes. Well, here
we have a Cricket.

422
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,005
Oh.

423
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,758
Yes, yes, and, uh, here
we have another Cricket.

424
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:29,427
Uh-huh.
And, uh...

425
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:31,545
Oh, here we have
the artist himself.

426
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:34,014
This is Rickety Cricket.
Hey-o.

427
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,351
Wow. Yeah, he literally has
the worst life imaginable.

428
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,803
He ain't lying.

429
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,271
So now you got some perspective

430
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,056
and some context.
Uh-huh.

431
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:44,309
And like a story or whatever
it is that you people need,

432
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,893
so...
Uh-huh.

433
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,506
We don't have
to talk numbers right now,

434
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,230
- but I feel like it should be...
- Hey, guys.

435
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:52,032
I figured this art opening
would be the perfect place

436
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:55,035
to premiere
my directorial debut.

437
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,570
No, Dee, absolutely not.

438
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:58,539
- That's a hard "no."
Yeah.

439
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,642
<i>Oh, come on. There were...</i>

440
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,594
No, Dee.
This is ridiculous.

441
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:26,401
_

442
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:30,012
_

443
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:33,433
_

444
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,466
_

445
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:40,948
_

446
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,286
Hey, hoser, remember when
I raped you in the library?

447
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:49,123
Hoser, hoser, hoser, hoser,
hoser, hoser, hoser...

448
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:51,208
Okay, thank you. Thank you very
much. I'm sorry. That was, uh...

449
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,294
That's not part
of the, uh, whole thing.

450
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,463
It's very disturbing.
It's very avant-garde.

451
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:58,015
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
What do you think it's all worth?

452
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,134
Good question.
Ango, what do you think?

453
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:02,136
Millions.

454
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,472
I'd trade my limbs for it.

455
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:08,275
Well, the market is dictated
by what people will pay, so...

456
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,945
Well, right, but how much
are<i> you</i> willing to pay for it?

457
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,530
Me?
Yeah.

458
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,648
Oh, no, no.

459
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,651
I'm really not interested
in buying anything.

460
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,236
But you own an art gallery.

461
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:20,738
Oh, no. Oh.

462
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,323
I<i> rent</i> an art gallery,

463
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,542
or more accurately,
my parents rent one for me.

464
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,744
What?!

465
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:29,163
So that painting I bought
from you was worthless?

466
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:30,581
Of course not.

467
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,166
It meant something to you.

468
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:34,502
It's worth
exactly what you paid.

469
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:36,804
I want to sell it back. Okay.

470
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,672
In that exchange,
it would only be worth

471
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:42,059
what<i> I</i> would pay for it,
which is, again, um, nothing.

472
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,511
I-I don't get it.

473
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:45,012
When is stuff art?

474
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,815
Uh, hey, guys,
guys, um, if I may,

475
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,267
I think I can sum this all up.

476
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:51,602
You see, art

477
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,821
is an ambiguous thing, yeah?

478
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:56,273
Yeah, just because you make
some art, it doesn't mean

479
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,442
that you're an artist.

480
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:01,111
But, also, it<i> does</i> mean
you're an artist.

481
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:03,030
But does it mean that that art

482
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:05,499
is good art?

483
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:09,286
Is art good just because
the right people say it's good?

484
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,755
Yes. Yes.

485
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:13,591
That's-that's how it works.

486
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:15,459
Yeah, but keep in mind,
you know,

487
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,294
a lot of modern art is...
is trash.

488
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,796
I mean, it's shitty.
It's not...

489
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,347
You know, it's not good.
It's terrible.

490
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,349
You know? And yet,
it's a fine line

491
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:25,686
between van Gogh and Van Damme,

492
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,555
you know,
between Depp and Grieco,

493
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,524
between Banksy and Charlie,

494
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,943
that makes it very difficult to
determine what's good art.

495
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,395
You know, what's high art?

496
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,030
What has worth?
What has meaning?

497
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,531
Yeah?

498
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,400
But if one thing

499
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:41,452
has become abundantly clear
to me today--

500
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:44,788
and it should be to all of you,
as well--

501
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,742
is that I wasn't raped.

502
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,578
Hmm?

503
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,796
We had a good time, she and I.

504
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:55,633
Yeah? It was a...
it was a two-way road.

505
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:58,135
The whole thing was... mutual.

506
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,641
And the woman in no way
looked like Rick Moranis.

507
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:05,759
You know?

508
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,979
She totally did. I remember her.
Remember her? Yeah.

509
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:11,165
Um...Oh, no.
I wouldn't even sleep with her.
