1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,171
[Mac] Well, this is
an interesting development.

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,840
[Dennis] This is not good.
[Charlie] You think maybe he's just vacationing?

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,344
No. Charlie, there's blocks in front and in
back of his tires. He's not going anywhere.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,346
Yeah. This guy's
planted himself here.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,307
And I tell you what, once all the other R.
V. Folks see what this R.V. guy is doing,

6
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,018
they're gonna start parking their R.
V.'s on our street. Shit.

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:22,021
We're gonna be staring down the
barrel of a shantytown situation.

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,775
Oh, my God. Who just takes their vehicle and
parks in someone's, you know, street...

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,903
and says, "This is my street.
I'm gonna live here now 'cause I'm poor"?

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,863
I'll tell you who.
New poor. What?

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,866
Ever since the recession hit, waves
of new people are suddenly broke.

12
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,369
These people have no idea
how to live without money.

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,538
They're what's called "new poor."
We're old poor.

14
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,873
Yeah, they could stand to learn
a lesson or two from us,

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,377
because we would never take our homelessness
and shove it down everybody's face.

16
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,170
Have some class
if you're gonna be poor!

17
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,464
All right. Let's get this guy out
of here, send him a message.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,508
Let's do it. Right.
Let's slash his tires.

19
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,302
Well, not that though, because then he can't leave.
That doesn't make any sense.

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,305
Well, you start putting plans under microscopes,
nothing's gonna make sense, all right?

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,767
Lots of things make sense. Slashing someone's
tires so that they leave makes no sense.

22
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,937
You gonna put everything I say under a microscope, bud?
It's a stupid idea, Charlie.

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,982
I'm sorry.
You have a better plan?

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,694
Dee! Sharpest item in the bar!
I need it now! Let's go!

25
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,780
Whoa. What the hell's
going on over here?

26
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,116
[Dee] Oh, Frank's
trying to kill himself.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,868
Is he all right?
Frank, are you all right?

28
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,078
Don't try to stop me.
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:24,041
- Oh, so he's alive. - I lost all my money
in a Ponzi scheme, Charlie. I'm broke!

30
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,752
His neck is so thick,

31
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,296
I feel like he's just gonna swing and
dangle around for a really long time.

32
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,715
That's what it is!
Let's cut him down.

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,342
Frank, it's not gonna work for you.
Your neck's too thick, buddy.

34
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,846
- Tie a chair to me.
- Times are tough, huh?

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,431
Shit.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,512
This is terrible.

37
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,514
What? What are you talking about?
What is terrible?

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,350
If you're looking for a better steak in an
arcade setting, you are shit out of luck.

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,436
I'm talking about eating out all the time.
It's a business expense, Frank.

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,481
It's only fair that the upper management
of the bar get together to talk shop...

41
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,566
over top-notch steak
and some video games.

42
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,821
You two have no idea how serious this is.
I can't bail you out anymore!

43
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,073
Maybe we should take this time
to streamline Paddy's,

44
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,741
make it run as efficiently
as the government.

45
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,369
[Dennis] Mmm! Yeah.
Cut out the steak dinners.

46
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,788
We're not cutting out the steak dinners,
so just hold your horses on that one.

47
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,374
If anything, we should be talking about bonuses.
Let's talk bonuses. Good idea.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,042
Bonuses?
[Dennis] Yeah!

49
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,419
You run the business into the
ground, and you want bonuses?

50
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,048
Frank, don't be a moron. You start cutting
bonuses, you're gonna lose your top guys.

51
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,634
You gotta separate the wheat
from the chaff somehow. Yeah.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,929
These dudes are all chaff. Right?
Yeah- Well, no. We're all wheat.

53
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,889
No, we're chaff. No, we're not.
We're- We're wheat.

54
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,100
Why would you want to be wheat?
Why would you ever want to be chaff?

55
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,185
Well, who wants to be- Okay,
I'll be chaff, you be wheat.

56
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,064
You two idiots have no
business sense whatsoever!

57
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,067
We have no business sense?
He's the one dangling from a noose 10 minutes ago.

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,694
[Laughs] That's a good point.

59
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,280
Let's start streamlining right now.
Frank, you're out. You're fired.

60
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,240
Oh! You just got
squeezed out, bitch!

61
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,284
Oh, I'm squeezed out?
Uh-huh.

62
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,452
Well, let's see how far
you two idiots get...

63
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,080
without Frank Reynolds bailing
you out every five minutes!

64
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,625
- I'm outta here! - I'm comfortable
being chaff if you want to be wheat.

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,919
[Dennis] Okay, man, whatever.

66
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,838
[Grunts]

67
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,633
[Dee] You're firing us?

68
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,595
Well, first we're gonna give you the
opportunity to defend your jobs.

69
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,804
- Really?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,348
All right. I appreciate
the opportunity, fellas.

71
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,684
- I'm on it! Whoo! - Good.
Show us what you do around here, Charlie.

72
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,769
- Hoo-woo-woo-woo! - Oh, come on!
This is bullshit!

73
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,855
I shouldn't have to
defend my job to you!

74
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,026
Dee, we don't know what it is that you do around here.
You don't seem to do anything.

75
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,112
Me? Come on!
I do a shitload!

76
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,072
Why don't you make us a drink?

77
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,825
Fine. I'll crack you
open a beer.

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,619
No, no, no.
Not a beer.

79
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,495
Something you have to mix.

80
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,497
But this bottle
is cold-activated.

81
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,583
I mean, look at it.
Doesn't that look delicious?

82
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,043
It does look delicious,
but mix me a drink.

83
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,712
But the mountains, they've turned blue.
Mojito me, please.

84
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,090
A refreshing mojito would do.
Nobody orders a mojito in this bar.

85
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,967
So you can't make a mojito?
Of course I can make a mojito!

86
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,471
Then make one. Fine!
One mojito coming up, gentlemen.

87
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,807
[Chuckling]

88
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,351
I quit.

89
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,311
Goddamn it! Shit!

90
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,521
I was really looking forward
to firing her. Me too.

91
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,567
Okay, boys,
let's talk rat traps, okay?

92
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,908
Huh?
I need money.

93
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,410
Huh? The guys were being
total knobs, so I quit.

94
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,373
Also, you're really behind on my rent and
they're threatening to evict me, so... money.

95
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,793
What part of "I am broke"
don't you guys understand?

96
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,712
I tried to hang myself.
No more bailouts!

97
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,924
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Not my problemo.

98
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,592
What's with the briefcase?

99
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,552
I'm gonna start a new business.

100
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,722
I created an empire before,
and I can do it again.

101
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,560
Huh. You are really good at making money.
Okay, I'm in.

102
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,105
What are you talking about?
What value are you to me?

103
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,731
I'm desperate,
so I'll do anything.

104
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,859
Okay, that's good.
Are you willing to destroy your credit?

105
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,862
It's never really been a problem before.
That's good. Hold that.

106
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,241
We're gonna take out a big loan in
your name and get an office. Great.

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,867
Okay, let's go.

108
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,578
All right,
that's the rainwater barrels.

109
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:34,667
Now let's talk about the trash. What do I do with the trash?
How do I dispose of the trash?

110
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,211
I don't know. We disposed of the
trash in the Dumpster last night.

111
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,839
What are you doing with it?
I am taking it to the furnace.

112
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,341
- We have a furnace? - Absolutely.
Where do you think the heat comes from?

113
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,094
You burn the trash in the furnace?
This bar runs on trash.

114
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,762
This bar is totally green
that way.

115
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,472
How is burning trash green?

116
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,475
Uh, because I'm recycling the
trash into heat for the bar.

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,104
And lots of smoke for the bar. I'm giving the
bar the good smoky smell that we all like.

118
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,731
The bar smells like trash.

119
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,733
That's the exact opposite
of green, Charlie.

120
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,609
Oh, I'm sorry.

121
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,612
Well, I could put the trash into a landfill
where it's gonna stay for millions of years,

122
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,990
or I could burn it up and get a
nice, smoky smell in here...

123
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,659
and let that smoke go into the
sky where it turns into stars.

124
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,163
That doesn't sound right, but I don't
know enough about stars to dispute it.

125
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,041
It's right. No, it's not right.
All right, are we almost done?

126
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,210
No, we're not done.
I got one more piece of business. What is it?

127
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,379
Lastly, before I open
the bar in the morning,

128
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,007
I always make sure
to turn on the Coors sign,

129
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,302
let people know we got iced delicious
Coors in the bar, you know,

130
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,721
and then, uh,
that's the last thing I do.

131
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,931
Ol' Charlie's done
a lot of work around here.

132
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,018
Charlie, that sign does
not say "Coors." Eh?

133
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,520
Goddamn it. Come outside!
Come outside! Come outside!

134
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,606
[Mac] Goddamn it.
Come outside.

135
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,109
Closed!
It says "closed," Charlie!

136
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,112
Okay. [Chuckles] Yeah, right.
I can see that now.

137
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,198
But, you know, you can't really
read it from the inside.

138
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,616
You can't read it
from the outside!

139
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,743
You know what? Forget it.
I can read it!

140
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,369
Are we done with this?
Have we gone through everything?

141
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,955
Well, that was the last thing that I do, sure.
Okay, great. You're fired!

142
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,749
No, come on.
You're not firing me.

143
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,334
Yeah. Yeah.
No way!

144
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,877
Oh, I'm sorry!
Oh, really?

145
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,505
So you're gonna throw all the
trash in the furnace yourselves.

146
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,508
And you're gonna filter the
rainwater barrel all by yourselves.

147
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,427
And I suppose you're gonna fiddle with the
electricity every day all by yourselves...

148
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,179
and siphon it from all
around the neighborhood.

149
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,891
No. We're gonna call a trash man,
an electrician, and a plumber...

150
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,852
and not turn the closed sign
on when the bar is open!

151
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,855
[Horn Honking]

152
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,857
[Mac]
No, God! What is this?

153
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,318
[Dennis] Are you kidding me?
This is what I was talking about.

154
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,530
We are gonna have a
shantytown here in no time.

155
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,365
[Mac]
Shit! Goddamn it!

156
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,908
Honey, I'm home!

157
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,411
Feast your eyes on the new
headquarters of Reynolds and Reynolds.

158
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,080
Frank and I
are starting a business.

159
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,374
We sublet our apartments.
We're living in here.

160
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,210
- Wait a second.
You subletted our apartment? - Yeah.

161
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,838
Well, what the hell, dude?
I don't know if I can live in a trailer, man.

162
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,715
You don't have to, Charlie.
It's kinda tight in there already.

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,844
Well, hang on a second, bro.
We're good in tight spaces. I'll make it work.

164
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,929
I'm sorry, Charlie.
What do you mean, you're sorry?

165
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,142
There's no room at the inn.
You kidding me, dude? You kidding me?

166
00:07:56,268 --> 00:08:00,354
Unbelievable! So now I'm reduced to
sleeping in the bar! Oh, hell no!

167
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,481
No, no, no. You're not gonna
be sleeping in the bar.

168
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,817
Where am I gonna live?
On the streets? It's a recession.

169
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,652
Times are tough. Yeah.
You'll bounce back, buddy.

170
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,238
Aw, come on, man.
Can I at least live with you guys?

171
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,031
[Both Laughing]

172
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,701
We're not in the business of giving out
handouts, Charlie. We're not the government.

173
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,912
Frankly, I'm a little embarrassed that you would ask.
Yeah, it's a little gauche.

174
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,706
You guys are boning me, man.

175
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,750
I tell you what, why don't you and
I hit D&B's and talk bonuses?

176
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,670
Yeah. All right. Dennis, why don't
you go ahead and lock that door.

177
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,380
You don't have
to lock the door.

178
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,382
Go ahead and lock him out.
Keep out the riffraff.

179
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,968
You don't have to lock the door.
You don't have to add insult to injury. I'm gonna be fine.

180
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,136
That's locked?
Yeah.

181
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,471
- I got plenty of places to go.
- No, you don't!

182
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,891
Okay, Frank, tell me about this
business scheme you're cooking up.

183
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,226
Give me your shoe.
My shoe?

184
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,812
Hand over your shoe.
All right.

185
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,524
Observe.

186
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,444
Wait. No, no, no-
Oh- Aw, come on, man!

187
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,779
That's a $200 shoe!
[Laughing]

188
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,865
Look at that.
What are you doing?

189
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,286
Feast your eyes
on your new business.

190
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,246
Knives.

191
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,042
You want me to sell knives door-to-door?
No. You're selling vacuums.

192
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,960
I'm sorry. I took out
a high-interest loan...

193
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,881
to invest in a door-to-door knife
and vacuum-selling business?

194
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,091
Not just any vacuum.
This is wet vac.

195
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,093
Commercial power for the home.

196
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,805
This'll get a red wine stain
out of anything. Look.

197
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,683
Oh, goddamn it!

198
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,645
[Laughing]
Check it out, Deandra.

199
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,315
All right,
this baby is powerful!

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,903
Now, cover your ears
because it has no muffler!

201
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,530
- [Motor Roaring]
- Oh!

202
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,410
[Shouts]

203
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,751
[Motor Continues Roaring]

204
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,806
Ah!
Oh, that's good merlot.

205
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,433
Yeah. That's good merlot.
You're gonna want to keep those coming.

206
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,435
It might be cheaper if youse
went with a bottle of wine...

207
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,312
instead of chugging
the individual glasses.

208
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,774
Mmm. Yeah, maybe leave the judgment
back in the kitchen 'cause...

209
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,360
There's a little bit of a look of judgment
on your face. Just go grab them and...

210
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,529
Okay, no problem. All right.
Okay. Thank you.

211
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,863
Great!
Oh, she's terrific.

212
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,991
I like her. Yeah, she's a cutie.
All right, listen, Mac.

213
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,493
I did bring you here for a
specific reason, okay? Hmm?

214
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,038
I got an idea for a stimulus plan for the
bar that's gonna blow your freakin' mind.

215
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,665
Stimulus plan? A stimulus plan.
You want to hear it?

216
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,917
Lay it on me, bro.
Take a look around you right now.

217
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,255
Now, at a time where businesses are simply
failing left and right, who's thriving?

218
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,758
Dave & Buster's. Dave & Buster's is thriving.
Why do you think that is?

219
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,970
I don't know. Video games?
Video games are definitely a big part of it.

220
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,724
I want you to do me a favor. Break down for
me what I'm holding in my hand right now.

221
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,101
Ah, that is
a Dave & Buster's Power Card.

222
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:48,397
Yes. Now, does your Dave & Buster's card
work at any other similar establishments?

223
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,232
Like, say, a T.G.I. Fridays?

224
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,652
Mine does not, and believe me, I've tried
at several locations. No, it doesn't.

225
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,406
Yeah, 'cause I've actually been with you on
many of those occasions where you've tried.

226
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,326
Right. I don't think I've tried it enough.
I think you have.

227
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,619
Because clearly, at this point, you should've
realized that it doesn't work anywhere else.

228
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,205
There's one in Franklin Mills I haven't tried.
I feel like that could maybe work.

229
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,375
It's not gonna work there either. Let's move past that.
I'm trying to make a point here.

230
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,336
When you come to Dave & Buster's
you spend your real money,

231
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,338
but you leave with
Dave & Buster's money.

232
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,214
That gives you incentive to
come back to Dave & Buster's...

233
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,216
'cause it's the only place
where your money works.

234
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,845
I think that's brilliant.
Maybe we should take a page out of D&B's book.

235
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,556
And try the card at the Friday's
out in the northeast...

236
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,017
No, you son of a bitch.
We're way past that at this point.

237
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,019
I don't understand why you
can't grasp that point.

238
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,897
It doesn't work anywhere else.
It's only gonna work here.

239
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,816
All right. I'm- I'm getting all worked up.
Okay? This is- Let's...

240
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,736
I'm proposing that we print
our own currency, okay?

241
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,696
Make our own money?
Yes!

242
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,492
We call it Paddy's Dollars. Now we distribute
that out to people for free initially.

243
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,536
Then they become customers, and
then they bring in new customers.

244
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,956
And then once they're in, they have to
use real dollars to buy Paddy's Dollars.

245
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,959
That's exactly right, and that
stimulates our own internal economy.

246
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,670
Yeah, yeah, dude! That's a great plan!
Then afterwards, we'll go out to Fox Chase...

247
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,464
and use the Power Card
at that Friday's out there.

248
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,342
Yeah, yeah, yeah! No, we won't.
You can though.

249
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,266
Look, Mom, um, I've kinda
come on some hard times...

250
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,560
with the economy
and everything.

251
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,188
I got no place to go
and everything, so...

252
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,816
I was figuring maybe I should move back
into my old room for a little while...

253
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,859
till I get back up on my feet.

254
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,405
Mmm, well, I don't think
that's gonna work out, Charlie.

255
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,324
Why not? I had to sublet
your room to Uncle Jack.

256
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,410
Is that why he's here?

257
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,329
Hey, Charlie.
Times are tough.

258
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,040
And the economy is so bad...

259
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,961
I needed to get more money in in
order to make the house payments.

260
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,004
What are you talking about?
You don't make house payments.

261
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,507
You own this house. You've owned it for years.
Mom, that's crazy.

262
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,801
- You collect Social Security.
- I need money.

263
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,887
You can share the room
with me, Charlie.

264
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,639
[Gasps] That's a great idea!

265
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,267
- That is not a great idea.
- Well, why not?

266
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,643
It'll be fun.

267
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,604
You know, you and me
palling around, getting nuts,

268
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,314
doing crazy, fun things.

269
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,527
I'm not doing any kind of things that
you want me to do with you, Uncle Jack.

270
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,280
No, it's- it's stuff
that relatives do.

271
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,701
- We'll share the room, Charlie. - I don't want
to share the room with you, dude, because I...

272
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:10,289
I will spend the whole night wide awake like
when I was a kid and you tried to share my room.

273
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,374
You ever seen wrestling
on television?

274
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,376
I am well aware
of what wrestling is.

275
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,795
It's just not what uncles
do to their nephews.

276
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,798
I'm out of here.

277
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,593
Hey, I'll call you later.
I know you will.

278
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,803
[Woman] Just grab any knife?

279
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,097
Just the sharpest one
in the kitchen.

280
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,185
[Whispering] All right, now when I cut
through the shoe and make the sale,

281
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,229
you suggest casually that we have
a drink to celebrate. Right.

282
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,857
And? Then I drop a little
wine on the carpet,

283
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,860
grab the wet vac, and then call
it a deal, whatever. Zing-o.

284
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,612
This is the best knife I own.

285
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,655
Oh. Oh.
All right. Mmm.

286
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,283
Well, if that's
the best you have...

287
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,579
All right, now pretend that this
shoe is an unboned chicken...

288
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,290
and you're gonna cook it tonight
and make a tasty dinner...

289
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,542
that's gonna smell all through
the house like cooked chicken.

290
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,836
Actually, I'm vegan.
Okay.

291
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,381
Then pretend this shoe
is whatever you people eat.

292
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,592
Maybe it is a shoe.
Nice one.

293
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,845
Watch the way your knife cuts.

294
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,058
Mmm. Oh, it's just flopping around.
Oh, shoot. I-It, you know, doesn't...

295
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,936
Shit's not even making a dent
in the leather.

296
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,730
This knife is a piece of crap.
Mm-hmm.

297
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,400
Oh.
Now take a look at our knife.

298
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,986
Beautiful pressed steel...
Oh.

299
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,948
With a nice,
razor-sharp edge.

300
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:31,078
Watch the way this knife blasts
through this shoe with one motion.

301
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,622
Uh-huh.
Owww!

302
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,959
Ohh! Ohh!
Is this part of the whole thing?

303
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,586
Oh, I cut myself!
Ohh! It's a deep cut!

304
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,256
Ohh! Ohh!
I see your bones!

305
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,466
- It's a deep cut! - I'll get you a towel!
I'll get you a towel!

306
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,970
- Oh, Frank! - It's okay. It's all right.
I got Band-Aids in my bag.

307
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,639
I just- I need
your bathroom, that's all.

308
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,641
Okay. All right.
I'll just get my bag. Okay.

309
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,643
Ohh! Okay.
But...

310
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,478
Eew.
Is he gonna be okay, 'cause...

311
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,481
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
He's gonna be fine, Beth. Don't worry.

312
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,775
I tell you what- Why don't you
and I have a glass of wine.

313
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,195
Just bring it down a little bit, huh?
I don't drink in the morning.

314
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,115
Yeah, me neither.
Oh, uh...

315
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,908
Oh, shoot!
Oh!

316
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,535
Oh, I'm missing it!
Hey!

317
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,036
Oh, no!
You're doing that on purpose!

318
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,915
I'm trying to prove a point here, Beth, okay?
Hmm? I- I don't...

319
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,001
[Stumbling, Crashing]
I'm gonna...

320
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,546
Okay, I-
Yeah. Oh, boy.

321
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,634
[Grunting]

322
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,928
[Groans]

323
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,889
Goddamn it!

324
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,309
- These Paddy's Dollars
look great, bro. - Yeah!

325
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,853
I'm really glad we went with the color.
They pop! Oh, yeah.

326
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,022
Little bit more expensive than I would've thought.
But that's worth it though.

327
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,690
That's
an old-poor move.

328
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,318
You take your money and put it into
something worth it, you're not tacky.

329
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,778
See, by transferring all of our
cash into these Paddy's Dollars...

330
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,199
and then printing more of these babies than
we ever had in cash, we've upped our value.

331
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,659
Shit!

332
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,787
[Dennis] Oh, goddamn it.
Look.

333
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,332
Full-blown shantytown.
We're screwed.

334
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,959
Wait a minute. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, dude.

335
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,296
There could be some
real opportunity in this.

336
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,548
Yeah? Yeah, man.
Think about this, dude.

337
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,384
In recession times, what thrives
more than anything else?

338
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,346
Prostitutes. No- Well, yeah, that.
But that and bars.

339
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,765
Oh, and bars! Well, yeah!
Right, because people gotta drown their sorrows.

340
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,475
Get drunk!
We own a bar!

341
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,477
Yeah! So why don't we take
these Paddy's Dollars...

342
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,896
and just distribute them
amongst the shanties?

343
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,690
That way- Right. They buy the
booze from us with the dollars.

344
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,069
Right. They run out of booze, then they
gotta buy more Paddy's Dollars from us.

345
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,696
Thus creating the self-sustaining
economy we've been looking for.

346
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,281
It stimulates our economy.

347
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,325
That's what Dave & Buster's does.
Give me one up here.

348
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,868
Boom.
Boom!

349
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,038
Who wants some free money, shanties?
[Laughing]

350
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,587
When people stop buying vacuum
cleaners and knives door-to-door,

351
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,589
it can mean only
one thing, Deandra.

352
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,967
That you blew all of my money
on a very stupid idea? No!

353
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,595
Good-bye, recession,
hello, depression.

354
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,432
You're very lucky that you're with
somebody as resilient as Frank Reynolds.

355
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,769
You've tried to off yourself two
times in the last 24 hours, Frank!

356
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,272
Listen, this business partner of mine called.
He's got a great plan.

357
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,400
This is the man
who's gonna make us rich.

358
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,651
This is the man?
Yes.

359
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,070
This man lives in a cardboard box!
Times is tough.

360
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,780
Goddamn it.
Yo!

361
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,907
Hey!
[Grunts]

362
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,909
Thanks for getting
down here so quick.

363
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,369
It's Charlie?
[Laughing] Hey, Charlie!

364
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,371
Charlie is
your new business partner?

365
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,290
Yeah. Well, what do you want?
We're good in tight spots.

366
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,876
That's right. All right.
You ready to do this? You got it.

367
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,670
Okay, let's go! Let's go!
You're the man with the plan.

368
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,714
Deandra, this is gonna work.

369
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,300
[Grunting] There we go.
Look at that.

370
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,429
- Feast your eyes.
- Here we go!

371
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,639
- [Charlie Yells]
- What the hell is that?

372
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,519
These are crabs!
Fresh, local Delaware runoff crabs.

373
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,312
Those don't look
anything like crabs.

374
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,898
Huh? Yeah, well- They
look like sea scorpions.

375
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,234
Isn't there some kind of, like,
sewage runoff around here?

376
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,447
Yeah, there's a pretty bad sewage runoff,
but, you know, crabs is sewage-proof!

377
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,907
And depression proof.
People gotta eat.

378
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,118
We're gonna sell these
on the street.

379
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,495
- We're crab people now.
- Crab people.

380
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,913
We're crab people now?
Yes!

381
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,415
You want us
to become crab people?

382
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,916
That's your new business plan?
Yeah...

383
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,836
[Phone Ringing] Yeah.
I'm getting a call.

384
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,046
We'll live and die
by the crab, Dee!

385
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,340
We'll eat off
the fat of the sea.

386
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,761
Help me toss some of these babies back, 'cause
legally we're not allowed to eat those.

387
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,764
Oh, thank you very much!
Thank you. Great news!

388
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,099
Let's go!
Forget the crabs! Okay.

389
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,145
- Nice doing business with you.
- All right, shanty!

390
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,855
Enjoy it! All right.
Enjoy yourselves.

391
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,356
Boom!
Okay.

392
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,775
Hey!
We did it.

393
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,985
I think we made every single one
of our Paddy's Dollars back.

394
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,113
You're damn right. Thus creating the
self-sustaining economy we've been looking for.

395
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,282
That's right.
How much fresh cash did we make?

396
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,242
Fresh cash?
Yes.

397
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,870
Uh, well, zero. Zero, if you're
talking about U.S. currency.

398
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,748
People didn't really seem
interested in spending any of that.

399
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,208
That's okay.

400
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,251
So when they run
out of the booze,

401
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,712
they'll come back in and they'll
have to buy more Paddy's Dollars.

402
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,423
Right. That is assuming, of course, that
they will come back here and drink.

403
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,551
They will because we'll
redistribute these to the shanties,

404
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,180
thus ensuring them coming back
in, keeping the money moving.

405
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,016
Well, no, if we just redistribute these,
then people will continue to drink for free.

406
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,852
Okay.
How does this work, Mac?

407
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,729
The money keeps moving
in a circle.

408
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,274
But- But we don't have any money.
All we have is this.

409
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,986
How does this work, dude?
I don't know. I thought you knew.

410
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,697
I thought you- What?
I thought you were on top of this!

411
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,700
You're the one that came up with the plan!
Did I come up with this plan?

412
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,871
Last night, dude, with the D&B Power Card
and the- Oh, I blacked out that night.

413
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,290
Shit, dude! I've been following
your lead! Oh, Jesus.

414
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,670
Oh, shit. Okay, so we have
no money and no inventory.

415
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,756
There's still something we can do.
That's still a business somehow.

416
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,593
How does D&B's do it? They've got a complicated system.
I cannot begin to understand it.

417
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,346
How does a self-sustaining
economy work?

418
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:46,059
I don't understand how the U.S. economy works,
much less some sort of a self-sustaining one.

419
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,019
I don't understand
how finances work.

420
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,563
Shots for everybody!

421
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:54,025
The government is reimbursing me
all the money I lost!

422
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,903
I love this country!
Baby, I'm back!

423
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,532
Wait, you got a bailout?
Yeah, you know it, pal!

424
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,452
Can you bail us out, Frank?
Because we're kind of screwed here.

425
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,289
I'll tell you what.
Let's discuss it over steaks and Skee-Ball.

426
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,249
Oh!
[Laughing, Yelling]

427
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,251
Hey, bailouts all around!
U.S.A.!

428
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,461
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
I love this country!

429
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,463
[Charlie] Crab meat!
Crab meat! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

430
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,799
- Crab meat!
- Crab meat!

431
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,468
Uh, you guys don't think that you're
going to Dave & Buster's, do you?

432
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,345
Uh-
