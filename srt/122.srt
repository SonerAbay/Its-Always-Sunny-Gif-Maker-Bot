1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:05,188
<i>First of all,
I'd like to say I-I personally</i>

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,322
didn't think any of us
would be standing

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:07,431
in front of you here today.

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,992
No, no, I mean...
Shit, no.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,193
I thought we were going
straight to hell. Yeah.

6
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,028
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Right, well...

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,380
But that being said-- I mean,
we're good people. Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:16,065
I did what I did.
You don't like it,

9
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,867
you can kiss my ass.
Oh, oh.

10
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,669
Easy, easy. Hey, could we
be judged individually?

11
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,554
'Cause I don't want
to be lumped in with him.

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,006
Look, I know
you're gonna judge us.

13
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,125
But before that
cruise ship went down,

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,810
we prayed. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yes. Yeah.

15
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:29,078
I mean, like, sure, we've
done some bad things,

16
00:00:29,147 --> 00:00:31,381
you know, but-but we've
changed, I promise.

17
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:32,816
I'm gonna walk you through how.
Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,118
So please just reserve
your judgment, okay?

19
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,686
Because once we're finished,

20
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:38,521
I'm sure you will
judge us accordingly.

21
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,256
Mm-hmm.

22
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:57,393

23
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,064
Goddamn, this ship is the tits!

24
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,515
Frank, Frank, watch
your language. You know?

25
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,317
This is a Christian cruise.

26
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:11,853
Yeah, and I got to say, winning
raffles, going on cruises--

27
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,688
I like this new church
of yours, Mac.

28
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,356
I think you found the right one.
Yeah.

29
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,076
Oh, I didn't find them.
They found me. Ah.

30
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,161
And it's all, of course,
a part of God's plan.

31
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,779
It's also a part of God's plan

32
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:24,015
that we all get closer
to him through fellowship.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,300
Hey, Mac, is God
gonna be able to protect

34
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,068
against the ship sinking?

35
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:30,205
God protects all things,
Charlie. He is an awesome god.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,608
The only way this ship is gonna
sink is if the captain's drunk.

37
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,603
Guys, we don't have to worry
about drunk captains,

38
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,078
'cause this is the
dry cruise, remember?

39
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,963
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
And about that, um,

40
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,599
where exactly does God stand
on that dry thing?

41
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,035
Is that a hard, fast rule
or is there some wiggle room?

42
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,421
Look, this cruise is an
opportunity for us to get away

43
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,690
from the sins of everyday life.
That being said,

44
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:51,543
we will each have to have a half
a cap of mouthwash every day.

45
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,778
You know, just to stave off
the shakes.

46
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,747
Smart, smart. Don't want to get sick.
Yeah. Oh, thank God.

47
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:58,933
Okay, guys, I am gonna head up
to Bible study right now. Oh.

48
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,069
Oh, right now. Uh, this is our suite.
Yeah, you guys can check in or whatever.

49
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,403
But the... Do you want
to meet me there?

50
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,504
Do we?
Yeah, yeah,

51
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:04,706
we'll, we'll...
We got to...

52
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:05,990
set our bags down
and then, uh...

53
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,325
Yeah, we... I have to
unpack, I always do.

54
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,743
All right. Peace
be with you.

55
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:09,852
All right. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,412
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

57
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,348
You're supposed to say,
"And also with you."

58
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,216
Why is that?
Would you say...

59
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,517
I'm not gonna say that. Uh,
you know what, I'll say it,

60
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,186
if it's gonna help you
get out of here

61
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:19,921
and go to your Bible study.
But I'm not gonna mean it.

62
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,955
Oh, you don't have to mean it.

63
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:22,023
Yeah, you just have to say it.

64
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:23,791
Okay. And also with you. Bye.

65
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,493
Guys, this is gonna be the best
cruise ever. And also with you.

66
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,028
Yeah.
I'm not saying it.

67
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,630
Take care.
I'm not saying that.

68
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,864
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh.
You don't have to mean it.

69
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,301
Mmm.
Yeah.

70
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:36,404
Oh, shit.

71
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,872
Yeah.
I needed that.

72
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,874
Man, and the beer calms
my nerves, too, you know

73
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,526
what I mean? I feel like I could
drink that whole suitcase. Oh, God,

74
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:43,278
me, too. But let's not, okay?

75
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,879
'Cause this is the only
alcohol on the entire ship.

76
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,564
Ooh, yeah.
Yeah. All right, okay.

77
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,483
That'd be bad.
But it's time to suit up now,

78
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,084
so we can get into some nonsense.
What do you mean, suit up?

79
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,085
Did you bring costumes?

80
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,170
Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,521
I'm gonna be the captain.

82
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,822
Charlie's gonna be
the first mate.

83
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,874
No, no, no, I-I'm putting

84
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:56,891
a stop to this right now.

85
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,559
No costumes, no high jinks.

86
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,161
Okay? Can we just... Guys,
can we take a vacation

87
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,829
from our usual bullshit?

88
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,481
You know, I'm not saying
we got to do the God stuff,

89
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,432
but let's not--
let's not do a bunch

90
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,451
of anti-God stuff either, okay?

91
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:08,002
So don't be gluttonous.

92
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,854
Okay? You--
no wrath.

93
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,707
No lust for me. You know,
which is gonna be difficult,

94
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,509
given the implications
of being on a boat.

95
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,344
All right, well, I'm taking
a vacation from you guys, okay?

96
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,246
I'm tired of getting shit on.
All right.

97
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,480
That's what I'm talking about,
Dee. Nobody's gonna shit on you.

98
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,633
Nobody's gonna call you a bird.

99
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,185
I agree. But first, I got to
take the cross off Oh, yeah.

100
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:27,889
that Mac gave us. This thing is
burning me to shit. Yeah, yeah.

101
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:28,890
- There. Look at that. Oh!
- Oh.

102
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,158
Oh! Goddamn, Frank.

103
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,392
Oh, my God.

104
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,744
You might actually be the devil.

105
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,728
Jesus, I'm gonna
take mine off, too.

106
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,730
I could be Satan.

107
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,864
Screw God!

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,454
Whoa, whoa, what-what was that?
Did-did God do that?

109
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,006
No, no, no. Don't go crazy
on the God stuff, all right?

110
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,775
That being said, the timing
of that big boat noise was...

111
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,311
pretty suspect, so, Frank,
maybe don't push his buttons?

112
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,179
Yeah. I get that. Yeah.

113
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,544
All right, I'll leave him alone.

114
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,966
Hey, Mac.

115
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,602
We are about ready to get
started. You feeling okay?

116
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,987
Yeah, David. It's good.
I-I just, uh,

117
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,022
was waiting on my friends.

118
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,575
They said they were gonna be
here and they're not here yet.

119
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,161
I should have taken on
a missionary position with them.

120
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,846
You know?
They need salvation.

121
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:10,281
Especially my one friend, Frank.

122
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,233
I even started putting
battery acid on the back

123
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,268
of his cross necklace
to burn through his skin.

124
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,486
Why?

125
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:16,772
Oh, to subtly send the message

126
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,823
that he might be a demon.

127
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:21,175
Oh, well, yikes.

128
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,745
Uh, listen, when your friends
are ready, they'll come.

129
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,740
Right, yeah. You know, we
should just get started.

130
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,098
Scott, you ready to go?
Yup, yup. All right,

131
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,266
everybody, why don't
we gather around.

132
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,450
Why don't we, uh...

133
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,702
Well, let's just...

134
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,919
We'll sing through it once

135
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,421
and we'll get it on its feet.

136
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,742
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

137
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,160
guys...
what's that song?

138
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,978
I-I'm not familiar
with that hymn.

139
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,397
Uh, the song's "Sit Down,
You're Rockin' the Boat"

140
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,332
from<i> Guys and Dolls.</i>

141
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,533
It's for the talent show.
We do it every year

142
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,301
on this cruise.
It's fun.

143
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,071
Fun? No, no, the songs
aren't supposed to be fun,

144
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,206
they're supposed to
be bleak and dreary,

145
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,075
so we can focus on
how bad we are.

146
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,411
Yeah. We need to
punish our ears

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,796
to pay for the original
sin of being born.

148
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,681
Mac, look, uh, I know
it can be difficult

149
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,350
transitioning into a new church.

150
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,886
All we ask is that
you try to keep an open mind.

151
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:06,854
Okay, I... Maybe
I can do that.

152
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,090
I... But, guys, I can
almost guarantee you

153
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,809

Yes!

161
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,558
Yes!

162
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:30,578
Yes! Yes!

163
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,514
I feel like I've been waiting
for this my entire life.

164
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,283
Good.
We're glad you had fun.

165
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,868
Yes, yeah.
I'm ready to go again.

166
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,219
Well, you've already gone twice.
We're sort of

167
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,504
taking turns...
We're gonna go

168
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,489
from the top. Five,
six, seven, eight...

169
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,691
These winter coats were a good
idea-- it is chilly. Yeah.

170
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,059
Come in handy.
You don't want...

171
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,544
They're cranking
the air conditioning.

172
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:47,645
Yeah, you don't want
to be sick on a boat.

173
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,947
Whoa, look at this place.

174
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,449
I think we died
and went to heaven, Frank.

175
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,418
Oh. Dude.

176
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,969
I thought you said they
didn't have alcohol.

177
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,137
Look, they-they
got screwdrivers.

178
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,321
Oh, no, Charlie.

179
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,323
That's just orange juice.

180
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,741
There's no alcohol. Just
orange juice, like the mixer?

181
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,643
Yeah.
Yeah, people drink it.

182
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,178
People drink it. Yeah.
That's crazy to me.

183
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,180
When was the last time
you drank straight mixer?

184
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,149
Oh, I had a diet cola mixer
a while ago.

185
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,150
Oh, did you?

186
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,384
Was it any good?

187
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,303
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
- Whoa.

188
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:13,888
What?
Dude.

189
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,490
You drinking a beer right now?

190
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,142
What? Get out of town.

191
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,811
You can lie, but that burp
told me the whole story.

192
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:20,995
You holding?
What you got?

193
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,497
You smell the beer?
You holding beer?

194
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:23,965
Come on, man.

195
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,183
Bingo!

196
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,451
Excuse me.

197
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,236
You can't have alcohol
on the ship.

198
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,470
Oh, this, uh, this is an empty.

199
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,222
That-that was
an empty can.

200
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,690
A pelican dropped it and we...
Yeah, we picked it up.

201
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:33,608
Yeah, it was, like...
Do you have

202
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,742
any more on you, sir?

203
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,377
No, not a bit.
Yeah.

204
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,646
What's going on here?
Uh, uh, Captain.

205
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,997
Do you have any more
alcohol on you?

206
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,165
Uh, not a bit.

207
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,634
If you'll excuse me. Yup.

208
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,186
Whoa!

209
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,687
What the hell is that, Frank?

210
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,333
Well, I don't want
to run back and forth

211
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,857
to the cabin all the time,
it's so far away.

212
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,425
Son of a bitch!

213
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,161
And you--
you have any beer on you?

214
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,379
Aah!

215
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:56,797
Charlie, you lied to me.

216
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,466
Uh, well, you lied first, man!

217
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,451
Is that the rest of it?
Yeah, that's all of it.

218
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,203
We have to confiscate all
these beers from you. Okay.

219
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,337
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.

220
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no.

221
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:14,115
That's my seat, bitch.

222
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,500
Excuse me.

223
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:17,301
Sorry. Got a little worked up.

224
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,020
Uh, not quite
in vacation mode yet.

225
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,388
Let me try again.

226
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,124
Um, please get your shit
off my seat.

227
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,359
I don't see your magazine
or towel on it,

228
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,278
and I got here first,

229
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,631
so I don't feel like
it's really your seat.

230
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm sitting with you. Thought you
were taking a vacation from us.

231
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,242
Yeah, I was trying,
but this is the only seat open,

232
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,577
so can you try not to shit on me

233
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,995
for, like, the next hour
or so, please?

234
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,320
I'm trying to relax.
Dee, relax.

235
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,948
I'm not gonna shit on you.

236
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,699
Okay? Nobody's
shitting on you.

237
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,451
How's it going
with the wrath thing?

238
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,969
You, uh, staying away from that?

239
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,387
Well, yeah, you know,
I was trying,

240
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,755
but there are certain
"see you next Tuesdays"

241
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,707
on this ship that are making it
very difficult.

242
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,125
Well, yeah, I
feel you. I'm...

243
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,727
I'm already struggling
with the lust thing.

244
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:02,446
See this, uh,
flaxen-haired seductress

245
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,998
across the pool over here?

246
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,000
Dennis, she looks like
she's 12 years old.

247
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,035
No, she's of age.
I checked.

248
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,838
Well, she's gallivanting
around, you know,

249
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,373
flaunting it for me,
and she knows how easy

250
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,058
it would be for me
to have her, too,

251
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,493
because of the implication.

252
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,877
Not that you would understand.

253
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,546
It's not what you think it is.

254
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,348
No, I think I get it. We're out
in the middle of the ocean.

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,116
She's stuck on a boat.
She couldn't possibly say no,

256
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:25,086
'cause something might go wrong
for her if she did.

257
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,637
That's... that's
exactly what it is.

258
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,322
How did you get that so fast?

259
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:31,626
It's like
when I'm alone with a guy,

260
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,528
and we're messing around, and he
gets all skittish about banging.

261
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,965
So then I insinuate
that it would be a shame

262
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,768
if my account of what happened
was different from his

263
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,570
and then he ended up getting
a call from the sheriff.

264
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,171
You know what I mean?

265
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,724
And then, boom. We plow.

266
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:50,077
Okay. Yeah. No,
I-I think I get it.

267
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,796
Yeah, right? Right, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,247
Oh, my God!

269
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,182
Oh, a bird shit on me!
Oh.

270
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,317
A bird shit in my mouth!

271
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,702
A bird shit inside of my mouth!

272
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,554
I'm literally getting shit on.

273
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,273
I'm literally getting shit on!

274
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,759
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Whoa!

275
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:07,428
Oh, yeah!
Hey.

276
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,280
Hey, fellowship was fun.
Yeah, see?

277
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,499
It doesn't have to be all dour
and penitent to praise God.

278
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,967
Is it my turn? Absolutely.
Step up.

279
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,468
Okay.

280
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,121
Aah! No!

281
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,173
I failed!
It's okay.

282
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,508
I failed. I failed you. Nah.

283
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:21,976
No.
I failed God.

284
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,079
All right, get me good.
Whoa.

285
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,547
Hello.
What is...?

286
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,082
I brought my cat-o'-nine-tails.
Yeah.

287
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,567
You know, so, flagellate me.
Three-three lashes for missing.

288
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,236
Why would you want me
to do that?

289
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,255
So I could be a better boy.

290
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,090
Mac, it isn't a sin to miss,
okay? That's...

291
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,535
We don't punish ourselves
for that.

292
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,276
You don't punish yourselves?

293
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,345
Then how do you become
closer to God?

294
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:45,116
By just appreciating the game
and the wonderful day.

295
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,817
Well, sure, yeah,
it's a wonderful day now,

296
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,636
but look at that storm coming.

297
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,137
That's
impending doom right there.

298
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,907
He-he probably sent that storm
because I keep failing him.

299
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,409
Look, just relax, try it again,

300
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,012
and this time, hey, no guilt.

301
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,947
No guilt?

302
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,666
Okay.

303
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,218
Oh, my.
Yes!

304
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,103
I did it! I did it!
All right.

305
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,722
In your face!
I beat your asses.

306
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,990
Whoa. Gay. Gay.

307
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,409
Gay, gay, gay, gay.

308
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,144
What are you doing?
Why are you two kissing?

309
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,963
Uh, because he's my husband,
and we love each other.

310
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,665
What's going on?

311
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,083
What-what about God?
You-you heard him.

312
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:22,803
He clapped and said, "No! Boom!"

313
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,573
You think thunder
is God clapping?

314
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,258
Oh, no.

315
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,238
Oh, no.

316
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,723
You think there's gonna
be anybody here with talent?

317
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,008
I mean,
this is a Christian cruise.

318
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,643
This is gonna be boring as shit.

319
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:40,745
I'm anticipating a boring show.

320
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,581
Oh, there she is.
Hmm.

322
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,266
Sitting by me again, huh?
Shut up.

323
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,235
I need something to wash the
bird shit taste out of my mouth.

324
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,753
Oh, yeah. I saw you guys.
Where are the beers?

325
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,421
In the captain's stomach.

326
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:51,606
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's, uh...

327
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,807
We kind of got, like,

328
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,025
you know, caught with them.

329
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,243
All of them?

330
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,627
Yup.
Pretty much, yeah.

331
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,730
I knew you couldn't stop
from being gluttonous.

332
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:00,114
Oh, you guys. Uh, all right, fine...
It was a mistake, man.

333
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,500
Give me the mouthwash.
I need the mouthwash then.

334
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,252
That's gone, too. I kind of drank...
all of it.

335
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,020
Charlie drank it. He needed to calm down.
You serious?

336
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,156
Goddamn it!

337
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,540
It doesn't do... Oh.

338
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:11,008
Whoa. Whoa. See. Oh!

339
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:12,610
See, I don't like
the storm, man.

340
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,362
The storm's starting to freak
me out. You know what I mean?

341
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:16,364
Yeah, WTF? Yes, yes, the
storm is intensifying.

342
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,766
And yet I remain calm
in spite of the fact that this

343
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,385
one here is dressed like this.

344
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,903
Uh... That's just crazy.
Yeah, it is weird.

345
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:23,955
This girl in the sweater?
He's been doing it all day.

346
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:25,540
You think that's...? Can you just...
can you just drop it?

347
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,858
Well, I would if she wouldn't
always be sitting in my eyeline.

348
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:29,277
Then again, that
is what she does.

349
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,862
She wants me
looking at her at all times.

350
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:33,014
She's driving me nuts,
I'll tell you.

351
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:34,932
Maybe I'll send her
a drink or something.

352
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:37,424
- A virgin daiquiri for the virgin?
- Guys, guys, guys, guys,

353
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:40,021
guys, guys, guys, guys, I've got
news, I've got terrible news.

354
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,490
- Oh, see this is exactly what I wanted a
vacation from. - Of course you do.

355
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,242
- There are two guys in this church...
- Yeah.

356
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,593
...that are gay.

357
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:46,844
Who's the other guy?

358
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,134
I don't get the joke.

359
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:56,587
What's wrong with that? So what? Well,
guys, being gay is not Christian.

360
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:58,306
Oh!

361
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,558
Oh, see? That's...
that's freaking me out.

362
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,243
That's the big man! That's the big man.
I don't know what it is,

363
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,846
but I don't like it.
Let's go find our beer, man.

364
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,298
We're gonna go snoop around, see if we can
find our beer. Let's look for some alcohol.

365
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:08,933
Recover that beer
and bring some back.

366
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,868
Yeah. Don't take 'em all.
And why is...?

367
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,503
Ladies and gents,

368
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,388
it's talent show time.
Please welcome

369
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,858
Marlene, the magician.

370
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:19,510
That's the bitch
who stole my chair!

371
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,513
Magic? The dark arts?
Are you guys serious?

372
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:25,149
First the queers.
Then sorcery?

373
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,251
This cruise is going
straight to hell. Okay.

374
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,687
I'm out of here!
All right. See ya.

375
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:30,855
Peace be with you.

376
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,190
We're not saying that other bit.
No.

377
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,708
Aah!

378
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,092
For my first trick tonight,

379
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,427
I'm going to need a volunteer.

380
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:41,466
Hmm. Hey, you, bird girl.

381
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,118
Come on up. Can you
believe this bitch?

382
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,453
Go. Go up.

383
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,121
I don't...
Bird girl.

384
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:49,841
Yes, we call her bird.
We also call her a bird.

385
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:55,196
Oh, baby. See? These costumes
are a great idea, Frank.

386
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,714
So we can go anywhere
we want on the ship now.

387
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,633
Anywhere we want.
And nobody's gonna know.

388
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,768
That's not exactly the first
mate's costume I had in mind.

389
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:02,386
Hey, man, you said "first
mate." That's gonna do.

390
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:04,322
I was, like, Gilligan.
That's the only guy I know.

391
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,656
Yeah, no.
It's good. It's good.

392
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:07,158
All right, so what do you think?

393
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,693
We find the captain's quarters,

394
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,161
kick down the door, find our beer.
Oh, no.

395
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:11,496
Strangle the guy or something.
Oh, no, no.

396
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:13,247
That beer? That beer
is long gone.

397
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,632
No, we don't want to do that.
Drank it, huh?

398
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,217
Oh, the party is
right down here.

399
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,635
And right down here below deck.
This is the party?

400
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,853
That's right. This is it.
I don't hear anything.

401
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,354
All I see is a bunch of pipes.

402
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,572
How is this a party?
The pipes are the party.

403
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:23,808
The pipes are the party?
Yeah.

404
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:24,892
What are you talking about? Well, all
the booze we're ever gonna need is

405
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,661
running through these pipes.

406
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:29,080
So, what? Wait, wait. We're just
gonna drink straight boat fuel?

407
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,566
No. We're gonna cut it.

408
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:32,651
With what?

409
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,185
Mixers.

410
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,287
Hmm?
Mmm.

411
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:40,074
Oh, good. Yeah,
you got one of those.

412
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,794
Lord, hear my prayer!

413
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,180
The only reason I went to
this church in the first place

414
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:49,033
was to become closer to you!

415
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:53,304
Well, that and the other church
was getting super Vietnamese.

416
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:56,240
I just need to know my purpose!

417
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,293
I-I used to think it was worship

418
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,479
and then song and dance!

419
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,814
I got to be honest,
I've really taken to it,

420
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,416
and I think musicals
are gonna become

421
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:08,135
a huge part of my life
moving forward!

422
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,887
But now
with these gay Christians,

423
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't know!

424
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,375
I need you to show me a sign

425
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,344
to tell me my purpose here!

426
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,762
Maybe some lightning!

427
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,531
Maybe some thunder?

428
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,100
No?

429
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,670
Should I have stuck
with the Vietnamese?

430
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,705
Is this your card?

431
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:32,367
Can I... can I
have the deck, please?

432
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,712
I-I got a trick that'll blow
you guys out of the water.

433
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,181
Wait, I'm confused. Is that a
challenge or a terrorist threat

434
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,649
to the ship?

435
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,252
Give me the goddamn deck.

436
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:42,770
By all means.

437
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,156
Pick a card, any card.

438
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:47,124
Hmm...

439
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:50,061
Now take a good look
at that card, please.

440
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:52,029
You might want to bring
it a little bit closer,

441
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,365
just so you can see it well.
A little bit closer. Great.

442
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,568
Now, tell me, what
suit is your card?

443
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,705
Spades.
Spades. Ooh. All right.

444
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,474
Now watch while I turn

445
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,494
these spades into stars.
Oh!

446
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:07,878
Oh, shit!

447
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:09,630
Who's getting shit on now,
bitch?

448
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:10,731
What is wrong with you?

449
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:13,234
You knocked out my tooth!

450
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,304
Did I? That wasn't the plan.
I didn't mean to-- I-I'm sorry.

451
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,688
I didn't mean to do that.

452
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:19,457
Get off the stage, bird girl!

453
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,876
She stole my chair at the pool,
and I got so hot about it.

454
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,928
Hey, hey. What?
No, no, no, no, no!

455
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,530
Yeah!

456
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:29,166
What? No. Aw, no, come on!

457
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:32,136
Well, what is this, boat jail?

458
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:35,206
I'm not
a goddamn Somali pirate, okay?

459
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,924
No, wait, wait! Ah...

460
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,438
Goddamn it.

461
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,489
...thunderstorms,
capable of producing gale-force winds...

462
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:47,617
The storm's worsening,
Captain. What should we do?

463
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,036
Fire the torpedoes!

464
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,883
What?
Full steam ahead!

465
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,992
- Christ, not you again!
- Frank, I think I found

466
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,827
where he's hiding the beer!
What do you got, Charlie?

467
00:15:56,913 --> 00:16:00,064
No, no, it's just, like, wires and stuff. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?

468
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:01,732
Put these men in the brig.

469
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:04,919
Charlie. Wait, wait.
Ah, get your hands off...

470
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,221
I'll dispose of those.

471
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,407
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know where...
No, no, don't let him drink that!

472
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:11,592
Don't let him drink
our torpedo juice!

473
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:17,031
Dee?

474
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:18,999
What'd you get thrown in for?

475
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:22,069
I couldn't control my wrath.
You? Yeah.

476
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,155
Gluttony.
Yeah.

477
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,791
Been drinking boat fuel and shit.
Oh, sure.

478
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,642
Sure.
Yeah.

479
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:30,811
Oh... hello.

480
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:36,067
Wow. I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you there.

481
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:41,972
Anyway, I, um... I should have
introduced myself earlier.

482
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:43,974
I'm the daiquiri man,

483
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:46,277
but I suspect you already knew
that, didn't you?

484
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,014
Was it good? Was it sweet?

485
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,682
I guess.

486
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,285
Well, it either was
or it wasn't.

487
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,287
Yeah.
Yeah. Of course.

488
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,522
Yeah. No, I had one, too.
It was... it was sweet.

489
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,191
You seem sweet.

490
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,077
I've been watching you

491
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:05,146
and following you, of sorts.

492
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,231
You know, in a good way.

493
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:10,301
So how'd you like
that magic show?

494
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:11,836
Do you enjoy magic?

495
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:15,239
You know, I-I can
do magic. Whoop.

496
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,291
Uh, how did you get that?
Get your license?

497
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:18,909
Don't worry about it.

498
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:22,029
1996, though. That's good.
That makes the cutoff.

499
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,782
There you go. I wasn't
gonna steal it.

500
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,667
Um...

501
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,720
So, how about this storm, huh?

502
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:31,605
I think it's kind
of cool, you know?

503
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,891
Here we are on a boat, you know,
out in the middle of...

504
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,510
out in the middle of nowhere,
and nobody would ever hear

505
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,696
our screams in this wind,
you know.

506
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,865
Oh.

507
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,701
The thunder's really... It's
throwing this whole thing off.

508
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,669
It's making everything
I say seem sinister,

509
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,938
which it's not intended to
be, you know what I mean?

510
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:49,990
What's up?
I-I'm sorry. I have to go.

511
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:52,476
No, no, no, no,
no. No. Sorry, no.

512
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,728
It's... There's nowhere to go.

513
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,575
There's really nowhere to go.

514
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,083
You know? So...

515
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:02,019
why don't I, uh,
come in your room?

516
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:05,339
"Come in your room."
That's not what I meant.

517
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:08,259
I would like to go in your room.

518
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:11,095
Um, and I suspect that maybe...

519
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:12,780
you might say no, and yet...

520
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,332
I also feel like maybe...

521
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:18,018
you wouldn't dare.

522
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:24,458
Well, that's not supposed
to happen.

523
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:26,504
Guys, come on, come on!
It was a misunderstanding!

524
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:29,113
The storm made it seem
way worse than it is.

525
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:32,783
She was never in any danger.

526
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:33,751
Lust?

527
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:36,687
Yeah.

528
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,294
Oh, my God, Mac.

529
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:44,812
You're soaking wet.
Are you okay?

530
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:46,313
Yeah.
I was out in the rain

531
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,765
looking for a sign from God.

532
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,083
I never got the timing right,

533
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,501
but doesn't matter.

534
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:51,869
The point is,
I thought I was here

535
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:53,837
for you guys to open my mind.

536
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:57,191
But now I realized
I'm here to close yours!

537
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,626
I'm sorry, what?

538
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,328
Guys, I'm here to convert you.

539
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:03,898
From being gay.

540
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:06,317
You want to convert us?
Yeah!

541
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,702
You realize
how insulting that is?

542
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:11,171
How would you like it
if I tried to convert you?

543
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:12,389
Uh... I wouldn't care.

544
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,475
'Cause that's, like, impossible.

545
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
There's no way you guys could
convert me to your lifestyle.

546
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,796
Let's give it a shot.

547
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:23,500
Well...

548
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,669
I'm gay.

549
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,254
Yeah.
No shit.

550
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,423
Oh, you guys knew this already?

551
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,891
That you were gay?
From the day we met.

552
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,176
Oh, my God, I've been trying...
Yeah, always.

553
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,310
Whoa, really?
But what's going on?

554
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,312
Did you just get tossed in here?

555
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,648
Or, like, why are you in here? Oh,
no, I just walked in on my own.

556
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,683
What?! You let the door
close behind you?!

557
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:41,018
I couldn't find you guys.
I wanted to hang out.

558
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:42,519
I had something
important to tell you.

559
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:45,022
What is it?
There is no God.

560
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,774
Well, what?! What is
happening right now?

561
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:47,858
Why, where are you getting this from?
Yeah, why...

562
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:49,360
I was like...
Okay.

563
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,744
If there was a God,
there's no way

564
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,196
that he would make me queer,
right?

565
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,081
I can't, I can't
listen to this anymore.

566
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,366
I got to get out of here.
I can't be around you.

567
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,167
I've got to get out of here!

568
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:58,452
Got to get out of here!

569
00:19:58,537 --> 00:19:59,453
What are you squawking about?

570
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,455
Let me out of here!

571
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,423
Honestly,
what's the point anyway?

572
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:03,874
There's no meaning to any of it.

573
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,292
There's no God,
there's no heaven,

574
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:06,627
there's no hell.
Wrong!

575
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:08,212
Oh, I just wanted
a couple of days.

576
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:09,430
Just a couple of days
away from you guys.

577
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:10,798
But I can't escape you!

578
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,349
You know where hell is, Mac?

579
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,267
You know where hell is?
It's right here.

580
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:14,885
It's right now.

581
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,688
We are in hell!

582
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:20,107
Oh, Jesus.

583
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,777
What the shit was that?

584
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:29,511
