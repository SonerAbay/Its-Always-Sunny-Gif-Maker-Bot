2
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,608
Turn this up. This is my jam.

3
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:44,945
Shit! Did I miss the turn?

4
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,451
Yeah, I think it was back there.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,647
Come on, man. You better hurry up
or we're gonna miss that boat.

6
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:51,486
Well, don't blame me. It took Dee a goddamn
hour to get dressed like a man.

7
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,219
Nah. Captain Barnacle.

8
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:56,558
It's a great new character
I'm working on. Arr!

9
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,723
- Give me another worm, Charlie.
- All right, coming up.

10
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,597
- You want rum or julep? That's a rum one.
- I'll take the rum one.

11
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,101
You guys brought worms in here?

12
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,762
Well, we kind of soaked them in alcohol...

13
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,169
and you suck the alcohol off of them.

14
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,263
- Ah.
- I ate mine.

15
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,830
You're gonna ruin this!

16
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,241
How often do boat parties
come around, and with hot Main Line women?

17
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:14,075
This is a classy event.
It took me hours to get us invited to this.

18
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:16,741
- Uh-oh! There's the boat.
- Ah... Aaah!

19
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:18,444
Goddamn it! We missed it.

20
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,180
Aw, this is great.
This is exactly what I was worried about.

21
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:22,778
Great, guys. Way to go.

22
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:24,790
You know what?
Screw it. I'm going in.

23
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,348
- What?
- Wh-What are you talking about?

24
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:27,916
- We're going in.
- Not in the water?

25
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,484
Yes, we're going in the wa...

26
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:31,292
Look, guys, this
car was built for this, okay?

27
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:32,854
It's got air intake valves.

28
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:36,266
This is precision British land-to-sea
craftsmanship at work.

29
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:39,169
We're going in.
We are not missing that boat.

30
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,861
What have we become?

31
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:09,026
I mean, we have literally
and figuratively missed the boat.

32
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:12,037
I-I used to be a cool guy, right?

33
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,005
With a cool car, hanging out all the time.

34
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:15,564
And now I'm a... What am I?

35
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:17,974
I'm a chauffeur to a bunch
of worm-sucking idiots!

36
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,671
You? What about me?

37
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:22,374
I used to be a party boy
who banged chicks all the time.

38
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:23,939
You guys remember.

39
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,144
But no one was
ever good enough for you, dude.

40
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,985
So I got self-conscious and I stopped.
Because of you, I changed who I am at my core!

41
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:32,547
Mac... Mac, that is not what happened, okay?
You are completely delusional.

42
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:36,392
I mean, by the way,
all of us have become so goddamn weird.

43
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,328
I think we're just hitting our stride.

44
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,195
- Oh, you think we're "hitting our
stride," Frank? Really? - Yeah!

45
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,498
'Cause Dee's in a goddamn costume every
other day. As a matter of fact, we all are.

46
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,232
I think we have more
costumes in the bar than we do kegs.

47
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:50,436
I mean, what-what if I said I wanted to become
a man-cheetah right now? What would you do?

48
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,978
- I'd go get the spots.
- He's got spots!

49
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:55,537
Why do you have spots? You shouldn't have
spots. That's absurd, man.

50
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,378
That's absurd.
You know what? I actually...

51
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,384
- I blame you for most of this.
- Me?

52
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:02,012
Yeah, because you came in here with your
endless goddamn supply of money...

53
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,578
and financed all this bizarre behavior.

54
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,784
You were plenty weird before me.

55
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,622
What about the underage drinking scheme?

56
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,184
I wasn't even here for that.

57
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,628
But that made sense, Frank.
It worked.

58
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,689
You know what?
I gotta get away from you people.

59
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,793
That's what it is. I-I-I fly off the handle
every five seconds now.

60
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,134
You know what?
I gotta get away from you people.

61
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,866
You're all insane! I'm storming out.

62
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,876
What? Don't copy me.
I'm the one who's angry. Goddamn it!

63
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,640
You don't storm out on me.
I storm out on you.

64
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:28,874
I'm the one who storms out!
I'm the one who... Oh, oh, oh!

65
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,541
Yeah, no, no.
Okay. You know what?

66
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,585
Yeah, that's fine.
Storm out. Get angry.

67
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,950
You guys be that guy,
'cause I'm not gonna be that guy anymore.

68
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,353
I'm not gonna get angry and shit.
I'm gonna cool off.

69
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:39,551
I'm gonna go back
to being what I was before.

70
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:41,560
A cool guy who just hangs out
and has a cool car.

71
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,858
So I'm not gonna storm out,
but I am gonna leave.

72
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,522
I'm gonna... leave casually.

73
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:55,264
You want to get lunch?

74
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,832
- Sure.
- Yeah?

75
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,741
When was the last time, like...

76
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,445
just you and me went out to eat?

77
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,077
- It's been a while, right?
- By ourselves?

78
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,781
- Yeah.
- I don't even know.

79
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:11,721
It's nice to go to a diner too, you know?

80
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,281
- Like, I like diners.
- Yes.

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,828
- I appreciate a menu with pictures.
- It makes it easier.

82
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,590
It's like, sometimes
those guys make me do things...

83
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,325
- that aren't really me, you know, like...
- Yeah.

84
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,867
Okay. I kind of feel compelled
to call you a bird right now...

85
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,835
- and throw my glass of water in your face.
- Right.

86
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,497
But, uh, you know,
I'm realizing that I only do that stuff...

87
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,371
'cause I don't want the guys
to do it to me first.

88
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,034
You know what I was about to do?

89
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,703
Pretend that I had to go to the bathroom.

90
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,009
Then I was gonna sneak out the window
and get out of here...

91
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,981
'cause I was afraid
you were gonna do that to me.

92
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,950
- Right, right, right.
- Isn't that weird?

93
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,509
- I was though. Yeah.
- Oh.

94
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:42,612
Yeah. But again,
I think it was only 'cause...

95
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,316
like, that's what
the guys would've done and...

96
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:46,791
- It's the peer pressure thing from those guys.
- Yeah. Right.

97
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,760
Okay. Well, forget the guys today, right?

98
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,557
- They're not here. So, um...
- Yeah.

99
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,030
- Like, what do you want to do?
- Uh, let's see.

100
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,659
I'd like to order my food
in a German accent.

101
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,703
- Right, right. Okay, cool.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,671
- Why?
- I guess that's just...

103
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:03,175
I-I put all these expectations on myself
to be funny all the time.

104
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,336
You know? 'Cause that's
what people have come to expect from me.

105
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,403
- Mmm. - But that's not fair.
It's too much pressure for me.

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,244
Yeah, right. No, I don't think anyone
expects that at all.

107
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,045
Well, what about you?
What do you want to do?

108
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,916
Okay. Uh, well,
I would like to get a chicken sandwich...

109
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,684
but, uh... but I think I wanna
get the beak on the side?

110
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,520
- Mmm.
- Frank's always making me eat it first...

111
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:22,026
and, frankly, I'd rather eat it last
if I'm gonna eat it at all.

112
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:23,858
Ooh, I can help you here.

113
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,991
Instead of eating it last,
you don't have to eat beak at all.

114
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,763
- Oh!
- Ready to order?

115
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,326
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

116
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,032
<i>Ja,</i> well, uh, I would like the...

117
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:38,373
I'm sorry. I would like
a chicken sandwich, please.

118
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,878
Okay. And you?

119
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,504
- Beak! No.
- No!

120
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:43,208
No.

121
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,844
- R-Regular chicken sandwich.
- That's it?

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,514
- That's it for him.
- Okay.

123
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,454
You did it!

124
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,788
- You did it.
- God, I really wanted to say it.

125
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,919
- I saw that you wanted to say it badly.
- Yeah, yeah.

126
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,724
- All right, well, this is good.
- This is great.

127
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,856
- I'm very proud of you.
- This is really good. All right.

128
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,423
Look at us! Cheers!

129
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,935
Yeah. No beak.

130
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,766
Bob, I want to thank you for
answering my ad so quickly.

131
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,640
Well, I really needed a car,
and I always wanted a Range Rover.

132
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,576
Yeah, well. Hey, I gotta tell you though.

133
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:15,739
This is not just a car. This is a lifestyle.

134
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,510
This is an Eddie Bauer edition.

135
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,280
Tortoiseshell interior,
supercharged twin cam...

136
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:23,049
European luxury sports-utility vehicle,
my friend.

137
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,387
- Wow.
- Yeah. It's a classic, okay?

138
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,154
The only reason I'm giving her up is 'cause
I'm ready to turn a page.

139
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,355
- Yeah. - I'm thinking about getting
an Alfa Romeo. What do you think?

140
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,557
Two seats.
Me and a babe. You like babes, Bob?

141
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,122
- Oh, yeah, sure!
- Yeah!

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,430
Who doesn't like babes? Yeah.

143
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:37,993
Yeah, it's a wonderful machine.

144
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,165
I used it to traverse
the plains of the Serengeti of my life.

145
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,641
And now I want that for you, Bob.

146
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,200
There she is.

147
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:50,109
I'm sorry. Are you t-talking about
the car in the river?

148
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:53,084
Yeah. Well, it's an amphibious
exploring vehicle, so...

149
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,746
You-You think you can pull it
out of the river?

150
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,724
No, no. What fun would that be?
That's not my job. That's your job.

151
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't want to take that from you.
You're gonna love it.

152
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,930
Yeah, right, but I just... I didn't bring a
change of clothes or anything.

153
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,932
That's not really my fault, is it?

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,468
You know, I gotta say, uh,
your line of questioning's starting to...

155
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,163
starting to annoy me.

156
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:14,468
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I just, you know, I
thought I was gonna see a car on land.

157
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,566
- You being cute right now? Is
that what's happening? - No.

158
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,873
- I'm not being cute.
- Then no sale! How about that?

159
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,675
'Cause you don't deserve
the car. The car has spoken. I have spoken.

160
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,511
You obviously don't get
what's happening here.

161
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,312
So be gone with you!

162
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,148
All right.

163
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,189
There's that anger coming up again.
I'm getting weird and arch.

164
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,690
But that's the gang's fault.
That's-That's not me. I'm fine, see?

165
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,728
I'm...
I'm calm, man. I'm cool as a cucumber.

166
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,558
It's all good. It's all good.

167
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,464
Talking to myself. But that's just 'cause
I-I've got shit to say, you know?

168
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:51,235
Oh, hey!
Hey, I'm Mac, former party boy.

169
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,142
Looking to get back
into the party-boy scene.

170
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:56,273
You want me to milk your adrenal gland?
You'll go berserk.

171
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,714
Eh? No?

172
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,048
That's all right. Ugly anyway.

173
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,984
You're gonna find that ass to crush.

174
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:03,750
Yoo-hoo, Mac.

175
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,756
Beat it, Frank.
You're acting like it's 2006.

176
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,320
Hey, listen, the hell with Dennis.

177
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,491
Don't let him screw up
a good thing that we got.

178
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,057
Come on,
we'll start our own crew.

179
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,933
Beat it, Jabroni. Hey, look at that.

180
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,996
Hmm?

181
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,939
What? Oh, that? Is that what you want?

182
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,909
I can get you all that you want.

183
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:27,947
Maybe I've been thinking
about this all wrong. You know, man?

184
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,414
Maybe I've been lying to myself
all these years.

185
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,576
Maybe that's what I need.

186
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,415
Well, we've always known that.

187
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,747
Party boy, coming your way.

188
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,223
- Guys...
- We did it.

189
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,692
We did it. Opened a bar.

190
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,888
- Hey, gang.
- We pulled it off.

191
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:47,228
- Frank.
- Oh, hello.

192
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,736
I just parted ways with my old crew, and
I'm looking for a new one.

193
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,634
I'm a financier.

194
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:56,698
Of fun things,
like schemes and pranks and such.

195
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,266
You got anything? You interested?

196
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,437
What?

197
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,640
Uh, what are you celebrating?

198
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,910
Uh, we-we just bought a bar together.

199
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:06,747
- You just bought a bar?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,377
That is fantastic.

201
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:09,921
- That's perfect.
- Thanks.

202
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,081
Next round's on me.

203
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:12,317
- Uh, thank you.
- Awesome.

204
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,552
Cheers!

205
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,730
You know, Mac and Dennis aren't here.
They're not gonna ridicule us.

206
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,664
We get to just pick whatever we want to do.

207
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,429
Well, you know I like making music.

208
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,232
Yeah, and I like listening to it...

209
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,138
but i-it hasn't really
ever gotten us anywhere in the past.

210
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,266
So, wh-what about poetry?

211
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:33,506
I like poetry, but only if it's def.

212
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,444
- Def poetry.
- Yeah, like def poetry slams.

213
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,449
Those are awesome.
I love that. What happened to that?

214
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:39,610
I don't know. Did people just stop
thinking they were cool?

215
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,620
That's crazy.
Black people don't do stuff that's not cool.

216
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,451
- Yeah, so...
- He doesn't deserve the car...

217
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:45,150
and that's the plain and simple of it.

218
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,021
- Are you crying?
- No, I wasn't...

219
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,721
It's humid outside, all right?
That-That's why there's moist...

220
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,822
I don't have to explain myself to a
worm-sucking idiot! Dee, where's the computer?

221
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,924
I thought you were gonna try and
control your rage.

222
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,764
This is irritation, okay?
There's a difference.

223
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,531
- And why are you irritated?
- I'm irritated...

224
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,004
because I'm having trouble
finding a proper buyer for the Range Rover.

225
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,907
I need to create a new ad
to attract an appropriate buyer, all right?

226
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,810
Not some asshole who's got
a problem with the car being in a river.

227
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,973
It's awesome that the car is
in a river. I need someone who can see that.

228
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,984
Arrogance, vanity, all over.

229
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,953
He's underwater, like a Range Rover.

230
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,546
I'm sorry, what is this? What are you doing?

231
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,784
- Def poetry.
- Don't do that.

232
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,759
Makeup smearin'.

233
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,318
No power steerin'.

234
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:26,559
He be talkin', but we don't be hearin'.

235
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,395
I command you to stop.

236
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,403
- Speaks like Zeus.
- Smells like poops.

237
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,237
Rage all over from his head
down to his shoes.

238
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:38,505
Zeus, poops and shoes?

239
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,741
Guys, you suck at def poetry. You know what?

240
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,577
Announcement. I have
an announcement to make, all right?

241
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,139
Thank you for gathering for me.

242
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,652
I'm wearing a mesh shirt,
and it's totally sweet.

243
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,688
You guys probably want me
to burn it, but I won't.

244
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:52,156
Now, I like this choice.
I like the choices I've made.

245
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:55,194
I like who I am, all right?

246
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:58,287
But I realize I've been
lying to myself over the past few years.

247
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:02,357
And I'm done lying, okay? And I found
someone who's gonna allow me to be me.

248
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:03,959
- Okay, good.
- Great! Finally.

249
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,232
- Let's do this.
- That makes sense. Let's get this over with.

250
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,795
- Let's talk about this.
- Yes!

251
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:11,935
Guys, I'd like you to meet
the love of my life, Dusty.

252
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,241
Come on in, Dusty.

253
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:16,144
Why did I have to wait in the hall?

254
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,046
Oh, I was doing a thing for my friends.

255
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,948
No, no, no,
Dusty's a man. Where's Dusty?

256
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,987
No, Dusty is a w-woman.

257
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,649
Why would you think...
Oh! Because of the name.

258
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,852
No, no, she's called Dusty
because she's really into angel dust.

259
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,054
I am super into angel dust.

260
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,063
- Does she have a dick?
- Why would you think she has a dick?

261
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,792
Come on, wh-what was that
whole speech about then?

262
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,629
Oh, well, the last few years...

263
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,328
I've been settling for fives, you know...

264
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,394
and I've been giving you the 10s, okay?

265
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,599
But then I realized,
you know what? I can be a 10 guy too.

266
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:44,768
I saw a 10,
I went after a 10, and I got a 10!

267
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,607
Let's go, Dusty.
We don't need these turkeys.

268
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,306
I'm gonna go slam ass.

269
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,412
I'm gonna go bang this chick.

270
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,749
- What the hell is this?
- Anger bubbling like a pot.

271
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,221
- Gettin' hot.
- Gonna explode...

272
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,383
like a bomb in a toad.

273
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,192
You mark my words.

274
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,823
If you decide to get into def poetry,
you are going to fail...

275
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,367
and bomb and gag and fail and bomb.

276
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:13,599
It's... That's just... You know, but I don't
care, man. That's cool.

277
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:16,665
Do whatever you want, man.
I-I'm a cool guy now, so...

278
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,176
I'm gonna grab this laptop.
I'm gonna go make a new ad...

279
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:21,145
for my awesome Range Rover,
which I'm gonna sell...

280
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,739
and then I'm gonna get myself an Alfa Romeo.

281
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:25,784
You know? Just me and a babe.

282
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,286
Just me and a babe.
So, you guys do whatever you want.

283
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:31,346
You like it? Come on.

284
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:38,257
- Why would you say that?
- I'm just kidding.

285
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:41,323
Guys, guys, guys! I got news.

286
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,129
I got terrible news.

287
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,999
Wait, dude, do I... Oh... Oh, yeah.

288
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,096
Hey. You're the...
You're that guy from the other night.

289
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,663
- Oh!
- I didn't recognize you without the hairpiece.

290
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:50,231
This is awful.

291
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,278
There's a Jew trying to buy us
out of everything.

292
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,836
You want to get him back?

293
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:57,075
- What are you... What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

294
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,779
W-Well, I'm not usually the idea man.
I'm the money man.

295
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,821
Okay, don't worry about it.

296
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,551
What we'll do is we'll have a beer, and then
we'll come up with something.

297
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,389
Okay. You know, we really appreciated
the drinks the other night...

298
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,190
but we-we've got to get to work.

299
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,164
You gotta get a ferret
down in the basement...

300
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:17,032
because Charlie says ferrets
scare the shit out of rats.

301
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:20,300
What are you talking about?
What is... Wh-Who is Charlie?

302
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,864
You're Charlie. No, you're too tall.

303
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,400
By any chance,
do you have homosexual tendencies?

304
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,471
For you,
you could be Dee, but you're smaller.

305
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,244
You got a better body, I think.

306
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,808
You, I don't know...
I don't know who the hell you are...

307
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,945
- 'cause we didn't have a black.
- Sir...

308
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:37,751
- Yeah?
- You got to get out of here.

309
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,848
Oh! Oh, I get it.

310
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,757
I get it.
I got to prove myself, right?

311
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,692
Okay, I get it.

312
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:47,494
I'm gonna get to work and I'll make it
really happen, and this is so exciting.

313
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,434
You guys, this is gonna be great.

314
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,601
Clear.

315
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:57,165
No fear.

316
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:00,872
Our words, our passion that flows like beer.

317
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,642
- Misery!
- Chains.

318
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,205
- Thunder.
- Rain.

319
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,773
We're chasing the dragon.

320
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,478
We're chasing our pain.

321
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,578
Now, stop, breathe.

322
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,215
- Unbroken.
- You're free.

323
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,126
- Shit, that's def. That's super def right there.
- Oh!

324
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,097
Oh, shit, that was the deffest.

325
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,656
- Hey, here's a crazy idea.
- Hmm?

326
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,225
Why don't we run out,
go to an open mike night, like, right now?

327
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:25,702
- Right now? I'm scared.
- Yeah, Dee.

328
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,636
No, I know, but, look,
without Mac and Dennis...

329
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,801
like, constantly coming down on us, you're
not gonna bomb. You're gonna do great.

330
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,707
You know,
I just feel like I'm feeling something.

331
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,871
- I'm totally feeling it.
- Something, like, crazy.

332
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I guess we make a really good...

333
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,046
- We make a really good team.
- We do make a really good team.

334
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:40,881
You're calming me down,
and we're good at this together.

335
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:41,977
- Cool, cool. All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

336
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,282
Let's do it. That's great.

337
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:44,618
Let's go to it.

338
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,134
- Oh, shit.
- Whoops!

339
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,900
Uh!

340
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,004
- Just kidding.
- Oh, yeah.

341
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:23,126
- Yeah. Great crowd, huh?
- Yeah, big night!

342
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:24,924
Hey-o! Beer me.

343
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,487
What a crowd, huh?

344
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,658
Oh. Hi. Uh, y-yeah.

345
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,292
It's-It's good. It's busy.

346
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,098
You're welcome.

347
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,934
Wait, you brought all these people here?

348
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,701
I bought 'em all fake IDs.

349
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,436
- Huh?
- Yeah.

350
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,002
These are all underage kids,
tweens and such.

351
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,372
I never got to do that scheme.

352
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,384
Why?
Why-Why-Why would you do this?

353
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:49,250
I don't know why they did it.
They must've had a good reason.

354
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:53,452
Oh, also, I let a ferret loose in here and
called the health inspector.

355
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,016
- What?
- What? Why?

356
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:58,063
- So you could do the thing, you know...
- Snap to.

357
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,620
You better do it quick too.

358
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,724
That kid looks sick as hell.

359
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,298
Excuse me.

360
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,069
Hi.

361
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,306
You the guy selling the car?

362
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,144
Uh, yeah. Y-Yes.

363
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,740
- Hi.
- Hi.

364
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,184
Yeah, I might like to buy it.
What do you want for it?

365
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,983
Well, I was thinking somewhere in the
ballpark of the original price...

366
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,251
but, uh, considering the circumstances...

367
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,350
I'm open to a reasonable discussion.

368
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,987
All right. I mean,
it is an amphibious exploring vehicle...

369
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,123
- so it should be fine, right?
- Yes.

370
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,031
Yes, absolutely.

371
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:39,629
It's nice to talk to a reasonable man.

372
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,764
Now, are you a sportsman?
Because you look very fit.

373
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,570
- Oh, I ski.
- You ski?

374
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,304
- Yeah.
- Oh, excellent. Love skiing. Yeah.

375
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,438
- Do you travel a lot?
- For work, yeah.

376
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,106
Europe? Eastern Europe?

377
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,740
Uh, all over, really.

378
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:55,150
And I assume you'll be taking
the car with you on these trips?

379
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,711
Me?
Oh, no. No, no, no.

380
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,053
I'm-I'm looking for something
for my daughter.

381
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:04,428
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

382
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:07,898
You know, safe,
slow vehicle. Good starter car.

383
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,534
- Starter car.
- That's right.

384
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,207
I have contained my rage
for as long as possible...

385
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:21,212
but I shall unleash my fury upon you...

386
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,374
like the crashing of a thousand waves!

387
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,442
Begone, vile man! Begone from me!

388
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,387
A starter car? This car is a finisher car!

389
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,321
A transporter of gods!

390
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,518
The golden god!

391
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:38,927
I am untethered and my rage knows no bounds!

392
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:52,774
- We're gonna figure this out.
- No, I know. I know.

393
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,507
Hey! What's up, bitches?

394
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:57,071
I'm a man-cheetah.

395
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,743
You want to do something with this?

396
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,686
We lost it. We lost our bar.

397
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,052
- Huh?
- Yeah.

398
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,750
The health inspector called the police, man.

399
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,690
The control board pulled our liquor license.

400
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,856
And we got a $75,000 fine
for serving minors.

401
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:16,925
Well, uh, the other crew always had
something up their sleeve. I got an idea.

402
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,631
We don't want to hear your ideas.
This is all your fault.

403
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,509
Well, wait, Kelly. Maybe he can help us.

404
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,637
It sounds like he's used
to this kind of thing.

405
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,738
- Really?
- Yeah, th-that's true.

406
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:32,909
He got us into this mess.
Maybe he can get us out of it.

407
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:36,284
Okay, old man. What's your plan?

408
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,887
Where did...

409
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,255
- Can I, um...
- What?

410
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,427
- No.
- There's a beer I want to, uh...

411
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,300
- Oh. Yeah, I'm s-sorry.
- So, you know, just...

412
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:53,861
All right? Okay. Do you want one, or...

413
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,600
- No, I... I don't.
- All right.

414
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:58,234
- Good.
- Yep.

415
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,274
Is it cold in here?

416
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,249
- I'm not a thermostat, so...
- Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

417
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:06,807
Hey. Okay, all right, all right, listen.

418
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,717
I want things to go back to normal, okay?

419
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:12,154
I don't like the way things have become, and
I want them to go back to the way they were.

420
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,782
I want things to go back to normal.

421
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:16,487
I don't like the way things
are going. I want 'em to go back to normal.

422
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,655
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- I'm storming in.

423
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,790
I was storming in...
What, are you a man-cheetah?

424
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,299
- Yeah.
- Cool.

425
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:23,892
- You like it? All right.
- Yes.

426
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,903
- All right, come on, let's...
- I can't do this anymore.

427
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:27,529
That last crew sucked on ice.

428
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,267
Okay, look, I like the man-cheetah thing.

429
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,104
I want to go back to doing shit like this.

430
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,406
Are you on board?
I want to go back to the way things were.

431
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,969
- Oh, yeah...
- Definitely want things to be normal again.

432
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,572
- We should go back in time. Can we
go back a lot? - Can we go way back?

433
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,084
Did you bomb and fail
and bomb, just like I knew you would?

434
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,676
- He did.
- Oh, yes, yeah. That's all that happened...

435
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:43,187
and nothing else happened other than that.

436
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,314
- It was a poetry thing. It was bad.
- It was really bad poetry.

437
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:47,222
- Shut up, bird!
- You shut up! You can't read!

438
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,420
Okay, this is good, all right.
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,466
Okay, this is good.
This is good. So we're all in agreement?

440
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,467
- Frank, pay to get my car out of the river.
- Yes? Done.

441
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:58,400
Good. All right.

442
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,994
Oh, shit. That's starting again.

443
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,438
Right, yeah, you know what?
Mac's not gonna want to go back to normal.

444
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,601
He's been banging that hot chick in
the back office all day.

445
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:07,612
No, I don't like this, okay?
It's-lt's unnatural, and I won't have it.

446
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,511
I'm putting an end to this right now.

447
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,140
We're going back to normal, yeah?

448
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,706
Yeah, you like that?

449
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,588
What the hell's going on in here?
What is this?

450
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:20,318
Oh, we totally just banged or whatever.

451
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:22,519
You're fully clothed, Mac.

452
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,825
Have you been pretending
to bang this chick the entire time?

453
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,862
- No.
- He can't even get it up with me.

454
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:31,129
Well, that's because
she's not even that hot.

455
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:33,296
- She's very hot.
- What?

456
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,272
I don't know.
I'm, like, not even feeling that, you know?

457
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:37,309
Can I get my angel dust now?

458
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,435
- Oh.
- Hmm.

459
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,741
- Yeah.
- Oh.

460
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:47,508
Okay.

461
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,854
Jesus Christ, dude.

462
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,413
Come on, buddy. You don't have to...

463
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,083
- Wow. Wow.
- No.

464
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,820
All right, you know what, guys?

465
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:58,226
Listen, it's fine.
It's all good, Mac, okay? Look...

466
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,527
Do you want to go back
to the way things were...

467
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,829
where we don't ask questions, you just
go about your business?

468
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,266
- Yeah!
- Done.

469
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,929
I was hoping this day would come.

470
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:11,340
I saved a special surprise for us.

471
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,900
- Is he a man-cheetah?
- Yeah!

472
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,003
Awesome. It's really cool.

473
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,342
Who wants rum ham?

474
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:18,474
Rum ham!

475
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:10,500
