10
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:32,058
I mean, you know, I need a
little... (sighs)

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,859
a little buoyancy in the
harmonies.

12
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,828
I mean, listen to the lyrics.
Right? "Not too hard...

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,630
not too soft."
You were coming in pretty

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,298
hard, I would say.
The lead's got to cut

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,033
through, Dee.
CHARLIE: I don't know, man.

16
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,735
I thought we sounded pretty
good.

17
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:45,238
Oh, we sounded "pretty good."
Oh, hi, super group Boyz II Men,

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,841
please let us win your contest.
We sound, eh, pretty good.

19
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:51,344
Come on, man.
If we're gonna open for Boyz II

20
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:53,713
Men at the Boyz II Men concert,
we need to dazzle them with our

21
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:55,348
harmonies.
Mmm...

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,483
Okay.
FRANK: He's dead.

23
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,051
Rodriguez is dead.
Frank, will you get out of

24
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:01,020
here?
We're in the middle of Boyz II

25
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,855
Men rehearsal.
Well, hold on a second.

26
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:04,890
I'll bite-- who's Rodriguez?
That sweet old man from our

27
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:07,093
building.
This is the worst flu that

28
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:09,428
Philly has ever seen.
Wow.

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,397
We have to quarantine
ourselves.

30
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:13,199
What?
MAC: Frank, we're not gonna

31
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,167
die of the flu because we're
young and vital.

32
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:17,169
You are old and feeble.
Actually, Frank does bring up

33
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:19,171
a good point.
We can't afford to get sick

34
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,407
right now.
'Cause you know what you can't

35
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,376
do when you get the flu?
Sing?

36
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:26,746
Sing.
Sing.

37
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:29,949
Yeah, I mean, I was gonna...
You wanted to say it?

38
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,917
Yeah, but I wanted to say it.
Oh, shit, well, I'm sorry,

39
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,886
man.
Uh, do you want to ask it

40
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:35,955
again, or...?
Ask us again.

41
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:38,391
Uh, you know what you can't
do when you get...?

42
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:40,326
Nah, forget it, it's fine.

45
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,651
All right, this
is gonna be good.

46
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:09,652
Everybody find a spot to put

47
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:11,621
your sleeping bags and
we'll be all set.

48
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:13,590
All right, Frank,
where we at, my man?

49
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,591
Well, right there.

50
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,559
You know, you don't
have to sleep together.

51
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,660
It's a comfort thing.

52
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:19,062
Guys, I got to say, I'm

53
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:20,163
excited to play quarantine.

54
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,130
Oh, my God, for the last

55
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:21,998
time, we're not playing

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
quarantine, this
is a quarantine.

57
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,268
Huh?

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,103
I'm gonna get so blacked out.
Yeah!

59
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,072
What are you talking about?
Mac, do you want to lose this

60
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:30,874
singing contest?
Why do you think we're

61
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,709
quarantining ourselves in the
first place?

62
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,677
To protect my life!
No, to preserve our vocal

63
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,847
cords, okay?
Which also means no alcohol,

64
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,983
guys.
Come on, dude!

65
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,784
That's crazy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

66
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,753
that's a good idea.
Because alcohol lowers your

67
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:46,055
immune system.
Well, why the hell are we

68
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:48,024
quarantining ourselves in a bar,
if we can't drink?

69
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:49,993
We got to drink.
Yes, hi, I'd like to order

70
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:53,363
two pepperonis, one combo and
breadsticks, like, a shitload of

71
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:55,331
breadsticks...
(Frank grunting)

72
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,567
Hey!
You can't do that.

73
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,703
This is a quarantine.
Nothing goes out, nothing comes

74
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,172
in.
Especially a pizza guy.

75
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:06,376
Going house to house, handling
money, banging lonely broads.

76
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:09,145
They're filthy!
All right, come on, listen.

77
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,247
I'm gonna take all your cell
phones.

78
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,549
You lost your privileges.
Thanks a lot, Dee.

79
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,885
It's just until the vaccine
is replenished.

80
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,687
He does make a good point,
you know?

81
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:20,189
Vaccines really do work.
My mom used to vaccinate me,

82
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:22,358
like, every month, and I never
got sick.

83
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,494
The reason you didn't get
sick was because you and your

84
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,396
mom would wear those ridiculous
bubble boy suits during the flu

85
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:28,164
season.
Okay, what are we gonna do in

86
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,233
here if we can't eat pizza or
drink beer?

87
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,201
Well, I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.

88
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,004
ALL: Practice.
Come on, man, you know, like,

89
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,773
just let me do it.
Like, why do you keep

90
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,141
doing that?
Why do you guys keep stealing

91
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:40,076
that from me?

92
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:45,715
ALL: ♪ Dum-dum-dum-da-da
Dum-dum-dum-da-da

93
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:50,186
Die-ya-ya-yada
Da-da-da-ah-oh. ♪

94
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,155
Yes!
That was good.

95
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,123
That sounded... that's harmony.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,159
It was terrible, let's try it
again, let's try, let's do it

97
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,493
it again.
We've been working this

98
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:58,861
forever.
I think it's fine for now.

99
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,697
Yeah.
You think fine is good enough

100
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,132
for the Boyz II the Men?
Ah, calm down.

101
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,101
Okay, guys, I think we're
focusing a little too much on

102
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,904
the singing and not enough on
the showmanship.

103
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,738
You know, maybe we should
work out a couple of sweet dance

104
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,373
moves, you know?
What is that? Yeah.

105
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,175
Like, that we could all do in
unison.

106
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,177
Or maybe we could wear the same
outfit!

107
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:16,312
Okay, yes!
We'll create a visual harmony,

108
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,514
same outfit, good.
Oh, you guys, you guys, if we

109
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:20,750
want to stand out, you know what
we got to do?

110
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,719
We got to focus on our story.
Yes!

111
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,887
Those competitions are all
about how singing helped you

112
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,990
overcome some major obstacle,
you know?

113
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:29,826
So I'll do, like, a stutter, and
I'll say I got it from-from

114
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:32,295
watching, like, a friend get
blown to bits in Iraq.

115
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:34,263
Ooh, ooh, you know what?
And do it with a Southern accent

116
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:36,065
and talk about Jesus a lot.
Yeah!

117
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,867
Good, good, okay, so we'll
be, like, a group of, like,

118
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:39,869
Southern, stuttering army vets
with, like, a religious bend.

119
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,671
Mm-hmm.
Okay, and then we'll all be

120
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,306
in the same outfit.
Oh, we should be, like,

121
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,008
carnies.
We're gonna be carnies.

122
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,510
Religious stuttering army
carnies.

123
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:49,445
Who love Jesus.
And watched our friends

124
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,447
explode on stage.
And have pearls and sing...

125
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,416
♪ My friend exploded
My friend exploded... ♪

126

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey!

127
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,053
It's great, no?
Hey.

128
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,855
No.
Absolutely not.

129
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:00,690
Are you kidding me?
What?

130
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,492
What?
It's a singing competition.

131
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:04,527
So can we please work on our
harmonies?

132
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,529
And not talk about dressing like
army carnies?

133
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,531
But then maybe one of us
can be a...

134
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,533
One, two, three.
(banging in distance)

135
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,536
Goddamn it! Come out here!
Come on out here.

136
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,505
What? What? What?
What is your problem?

137
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:18,408
This.
I found it in the back office

138
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,611
in the garbage.
It's still warm.

139
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,148
This whole quarantine has been
compromised.

140
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,517
What... me?!
Come on... come on.

141
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,519
Why would I do it?
You guys would suspect me.

142
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,487
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a
recent delivery you made to

143
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,456
Paddy's Pub.
I'll get to the bottom of

144
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,825
this.
Yeah, all right, well, what was

145
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,461
the name on the order?
(Dennis chuckling)

146
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,463
Spider-Man.
That's very clever, yeah,

147
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,166
yeah, yeah.
Dennis, ask him how it's

148
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:47,603
possible for him to talk to you
through a cut phone wire.

149
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,939
How is it possible for you to
talk to me through a cut ph...

150
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,408
(Dennis stammers)
I cut it when I found the

151
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,011
pizza.
Holy shit.

152
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,781
Dennis is Spider-Man.
No... no one is Spider-Man.

153
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:01,350
Fine, yeah, oh, yeah, it was
me, the evil villain with the

154
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:04,320
perfect voice who ordered the
pizza, but, guys, you don't have

155
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,289
to worry about me, all right?
I can fight off whatever stupid

156
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,291
illness this pizza may or may
not have had, all right?

157
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:10,259
I'm in perfect control of my
body.

158
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,762
Just like I am with my voice.
I-I-I can go from flaccid to

159
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:14,797
erect at a moment's notice.
He can, I've seen it.

160
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,266
Buddy, you're seeing it.
You're all seeing it.

161
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:20,036
'Cause I'm doing it right now.
Flaccid, erect.

162
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,974
Flaccid, erect.
Flaccid, erect.

163
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:29,345
Not too hard, not too soft.

164
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,482
Come on, what are you doing?!
You're gonna quarantine me

165
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,952
inside a quarantine, really?
Aw, sh...

166
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:41,624
Now, this is the look that I
was talking about.

167
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,793
You got the bow ties and the
ball caps.

168
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:46,028
It's casual formal.
Yeah, right, right, right.

169
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,297
Like, are they bat boys or are
they butlers?

170
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,433
You don't know, but it's like a
sweet look.

171
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,736
DENNIS: ♪ Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
- ma-ma-ma. ♪

172
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,872
What is he doing?
Oh, I'm just warming up my

173
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,874
voice a little bit.
You guys should, uh, keep warm.

174
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,775
Stay warm.
Oh, my God, I'm loving him

175
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,511
in the bathroom.
Me, too.

176
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,679
I mean, it's great.
Now, I did a little sketch

177
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,915
of the outfit myself.
And I wasn't quite sure what

178
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,217
you were going for.
Like, if we were all each gonna

179
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,087
be a body part, or if you wanted
us mashed in this thing

180
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,089
side-by-side somehow?
What are you talking about?

181
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:15,758
Well, you said that we're all
in the same outfit, right?

182
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,027
So I'm trying to figure, like,
who goes where.

183
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,196
"Same" as in "matching,"
not same as in jammed into

184
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,798
the same set of clothing.
Okay, not sure that's

185
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,035
as good, 'cause this really
makes a splash with the crowd.

186
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:28,404
Dee, what do you think
about all this?

187
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,073
(hick accent): D-D-D-Don't-
Don't put me on the spot.

188
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,511
I-I'm just, I-I-I'm just a
Jesus-loving e-e-ex-marine.

189
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:38,548
That's really good.
I mean, so, so sad.

190
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,917
It's supposed to be sad.
It's supposed to guilt them

191
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,486
into voting for us, you know.
(hick accent): That's not all.

192
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:46,455
This Bible's a Bible of my
daddy who just di-di-died

193
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:50,626
in my-my arms of-of throat
cancer, from-from eating

194
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:55,164
some-some-some bad pussy.
Hmm. Hmm.

195
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,900
You just earned you spot at
the head of the suit, Dee.

196
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,802
That was really good.
That was good.

197
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,804
Frank, what the hell
are you doing, dude?

198
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,340
I'm getting rid of all this
contaminated crap!

199
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,576
Now, come on, you're going
crazy with this food

200
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:08,744
thing, Frank.
We need to eat.

201
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,714
We need to eat, but we only
eat protected food from now on.

202
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:15,117
Like, oranges and coconuts
and snow crab.

203
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,787
No! No snow crabs!
The shells could lacerate

204
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,955
your throats.
Absolutely not.

205
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,290
Okay, well, someone's gonna
have to go out and get this

206
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,092
food, so I'll do it.
No, no, no!

207
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,228
You can go out together.
You can't go out alone.

208
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,830
In case one of you get sneezed
on, the other one can

209
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:29,699
report back.
Frank, tell you what.

210
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,335
Mac and I will go out.
And I guarantee we won't

211
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,871
get sneezed on.
All right, dude, first things

212
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,506
first.
Let's get some beer, man.

213
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,342
You know, screw Dennis
and his rules.

214
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,677
The guy's, like, you know,
such a dick about shit.

215
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,813
Yeah, dude, he can be
so controlling, you know?

216
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,282
He can do really cool stuff
with his dick, though.

217
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,417
You gotta ease up on talking
about dicks, man.

218
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,686
Like, it's just, it's too much
by this point.

219
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:54,056
You think? Oh, wait a second.
There's no, there's no

220
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:55,891
opening to this.
Shit, I'm sorry, dude.

221
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,693
I forgot, there's no opening
in yours.

222
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,997
But my mom rigged hers with a
special pouch so that she could

223
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,866
have her cocktails.
See? It fills up.

224
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,902
Your mom rigged her suit so
she could drink booze?

225
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,839
Dude, you mom's an alcoholic.
My mom's not an alcoholic!

226
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,675
No, bro! She is, but it's
totally cool, because it skips

227
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,777
a generation.
That's why you're not

228
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,747
an alcoholic.
(woman coughs, Mac gasps)

229
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:23,119
That's not good right
there, man!

230
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,054
There's too many bogeys!
Let's get some fruit,

231
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,589
let's get out of here,
let's get back

232
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:28,224
to the quarantine.
That's right, man.

233
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:33,062
Let's get out of here.
Whoa! Stop!

234
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:35,665
What is this? I love it!
Huh?

235
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,633
What was all this?
Oh, it's just a little

236
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,535
dance move I've been working on.
It's stupid.

237
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,304
I was just practicing.
No, man, that's sweet

238
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:42,571
as hell.
Show me that shit.

239
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,240
You like it?
Yeah!

240
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,108
It sort of like a Fly Girl
power spin.

241
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,010
I've been working on it.
It's a...

242
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,980
You want to see the whole thing?
It's sort of a...

243
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:54,417
Whoo! (grunts)
Oh, shit, you all right?

244
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,787
It's a balance thing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

245
00:09:57,789 --> 00:09:59,855
You got a breach!
Oh, shit!

246
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:02,825
Come on.
Hey! Close your pit!

247
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:04,226
Close your pit!
Don't tell Frank.

248
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,995
I won't tell Frank.
Hold your arm.

249
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,663
Don't tell Frank.
Hold your breath. Go! Move!

250
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,598
Charlie, don't tell Frank!

251
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:15,864
Look at all the hair.
Look at the hair.

252
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,672
It's like a goddamn
barber shop.

253
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:21,374
Be on the lookout, Deandra!
Yeah, copy that.

254
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,710
Looking for hair.
Stop talking about hair,

255
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:25,746
please.
It's very annoying to me.

256
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:30,383
That's what carries
the disease, Dennis-- the hair.

257
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:33,854
We don't really need it.
Look at us.

258
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:37,691
We're evolving without it.
We came from the apes,

259
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:43,296
and look at us now.
One day, we'll be completely

260
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:47,701
hairless and totally pure.
Yeah, you should write

261
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:49,636
that down.

262
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:57,444
What are you doing?
Cleaning, cleaning.

263
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,046
You know, you said scrub
the place from top to bottom.

264
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:03,416
And it was a good thing that I
did, too, because I'll tell

265
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:05,218
you what.
Mad dusty up there.

266
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,354
Yeah, good-good...
good thinking.

267
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,956
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,136
Were you eating pizza
and drinking beer up there?

269
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:26,840
Yes, Frank, I was eating and
drinking in a ceiling.

270
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:30,076
I mean, will you use your head?
No, I'm getting a little

271
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,344
stir crazy.
Yeah.

272
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:34,214
That's-that's...
Yeah, it's driving you nuts.

273
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:35,882
Driving me nuts.
I get it.

274
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:39,352
Right.
One more thing.

275
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:40,636
Hmm?

276
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:51,464
That's not mine.
(Frank growls)

277
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:55,635
Hey, Frank, are you kidding me?
Goddamn it, it's just one beer!

278
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:59,406
Oh!
It only takes one germ, Dee.

279
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:02,475
Oh, Jesus!
Of course, how anybody thinks

280
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:05,212
that a germ could survive
a scalding hot pizza

281
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,181
is beyond me.
(coughs)

282
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:09,716
Oh, Dennis, you don't
look good.

283
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:13,687
Trust me, Dee, if I found
myself getting sick, I would

284
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:20,093
simply say...
"Sickness be gone!"

285
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,096
(Dennis groans)
(Dee shrieks)

286
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:26,299
It's all here, you know:
oranges, hand sanitizer,

287
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:28,668
basically everything.
No snow crabs, you know.

288
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,039
Hey, where's Dee?
Quarantined.

289
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:38,078
There was a breach.
No breaches on your end, right?

290
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,280
No.
No, no breaches.

291
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:42,315
Yeah. Everything's cool.
No, no, breaches.

292
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,351
Yeah, everything was cool.
Yeah, everything was good.

293
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,020
Good. I'm gonna go shave.
Get all this filthy hair

294
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:50,924
off my face.
Oh.

295
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:54,027
Then when I come back,
we'll play some games so nobody

296
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,397
goes nuts or nothing.
(humming)

297
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:07,173
Uh, movie, movie.
Okay, movie.

298
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:10,076
Two, three, four, five words.
Doesn't matter?

<i>That's why I shaved it off.</i>

305
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,498
<i>Now it just flows off my body.</i>
<i>You should do the same, mm-hmm.</i>

<i>That's not true! Oh, you rat!</i>
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

310
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:45,612
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

313
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:52,352
<i>Oh, I'm-I'm sick as a dog</i>

314
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:55,555
<i>Oh, if you guys are getting</i>

Charlie?

00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:48,466
Charlie, look at that.
Look how clean I am.

328
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,653
Dude, you look like a
shriveled raisin.

329
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,922
It's all about purity, Charlie.

330
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:56,626
Humans are filthy.
Dirty filthy.

331
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,195
All right, man.
You got to mix in with

beasts...
fowl, rodents.

333
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:08,504
People do what they do, man.
What am I gonna do about it?

334
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:12,408
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna clean Philadelphia.

335
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,945
Good.
A giant cleanse.

336
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:21,417
Well, good luck with that.
Not the city...

337
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:26,889
the population.
Okay, well...

338
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,192
go for it.

339
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:43,840
I can't stop shaking.
It's so hot and also so cold.

340
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,809
What's up, what's up?
Talking hot and cold?

341
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,212
Mm-hmm.
Charlie, are you sick, too?

342
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,214
Hmm, sick?
Nah, Frank's all trying to

343
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,883
shave me and shit.
I'm like, "Dude, no way."

344
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,952
So, I figured I'd hang out with
you guys instead, you know?

345
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,954
We're very sick, we have the
flu.

346
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,956
If you, if you stay in here,
you're gonna get sick.

347
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,091
Good, he deserves it for
ratting me out.

348
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,794
Please, Mac, I've been
vaccinated for every disease in

349
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:08,564
the book.
I'm gonna be just fine.

350
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:14,070
(Charlie retching)
Oh, God.

351
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:18,040
That's a lot of throw up.
This flu is so brutal.

352
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,977
(Dennis coughs)
Hey, guys?

353
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,514
I think I might be coming down
with something, too.

354
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,984
Are you kidding me, dude?
Like, I think you're gonna die.

355
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,653
I think I'm gonna die.
I've never felt like this before

356
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,289
in my life.
If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna

357
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:37,026
go down drinking.
Anyone want some booze?

358
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,061
I knew you drank cleaning
supplies.

359
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:42,298
Oh, no, dude, this is booze.
I stash whiskey in here.

360
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,601
Dude, you are an alcoholic.
Whatever.

361
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:48,538
Dee stashes warm beer in the
ceiling of the back office.

362
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,907
I keep a flask of créme de
menthe behind the jukebox in the

363
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,909
bar, it's not a big deal.
Just drink, you know, because

364
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,877
this might be our last chance.
Bottoms up.

365
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,846
(Dee groans, gulps)

366
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:03,052
I'm not getting it.
So you crawl around on the bed,

367
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:05,329
looking for minerals?
Uh, no.

368
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:07,331
If I'm looking for minerals,
I got to be under the bed.

369
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,133
Minerals on top of the bed
doesn't make any sense,

370
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:10,968
actually.
None of this makes any sense.

371
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,204
It's insane.
You know, I don't know about

372
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,339
you guys, and I don't know why
this is happening, but I

373
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:17,408
actually feel a lot better.
Well, you look better.

374
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,243
You guys all look better.
I'm actually feeling better,

375
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,045
too.
I feel great.

376
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:23,047
Yeah.
How is that even possible?

377
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,383
All we've been doing is sitting
here and drinking.

378
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,351
How could we have gotten better
so quickly?

379
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:30,721
Oh, my God, you guys.
You guys, we haven't been

380
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,690
drinking since we quarantined
ourselves into the bar.

381
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,525
At least since we got stuck
in the bathroom.

382
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,360
Oh, that's right.
Wait, wait, wait, so what are

383
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,629
you saying?
That-that we never had the flu?

384
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,131
We were just having alcohol
withdrawal?

385
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,133
Yeah.
Alcohol withdrawals!

386
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,368
That's great!
Is it great? It means

387
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,104
we're all alcoholics.
MAC & CHARLIE: Ah...

388
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:49,140
Yeah, yeah... right.
What do we do with that

389
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:51,475
information?
What do you do with

390
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:53,144
any information?
You just stuff it deep down

391
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,079
inside and keep an eye on it.
You keep it.

392
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,614
I'm certainly not gonna
stop drinking.

393
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,582
I mean, I physically can't.
No, no, not at this point.

394
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,117
We're in, we're in too deep.
Yeah.

395
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,019
I'm a, I'm a young guy.
Just kids having fun, right?

396
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:03,788
That's right.
We got an audition to make.

397
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,256
So let's bust this door
down, Mac.

398
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,558
What do you say, you want
to roundhouse the door for us?

399
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,760
I was gonna suggest that.
Yeah, I know you were, buddy.

400
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:12,363
That's why I said it.
Just do it and get it over with.

401
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:13,898
Okay.
Hold on, hold on, though.

402
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,567
If we don't want to break the
door, I have a key.

403
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,370
You've got a key?!
We've been in here this whole

404
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,439
time, and you could've
let us out?!

405
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:23,574
I didn't know that we were
trapped in here.

406
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,076
I thought we were just
playing quarantine.

407
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,410
What the...?!
No, we're not playing

408
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,145
quarantine.
We're quarantined.

409
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,048
Let's go.
Just open the door.

410
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,719
Yo, Frank! We're not sick.
Yeah, we're fine, dude. We...

411
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:38,389
Whoa. What the hell is this?
Oh, shit, I think

412
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:40,391
it's hand sanitizer.
Hmm?

413
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,460
Hand sanitizer?
Where is it going?

414
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:46,964
Frank?
Uh, why is there hand sanitizer

415
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,568
all over the floor?
It goes in here and...

416
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,269
Oh!
Frank?

417
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,638
Oh, my God!
What the hell did you do

418
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,077
to yourself?
I just want to be pure.

419
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,179
God, what are we gonna
do about this?

420
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:05,249
Probably get him to the
hospital, right?

421
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:09,453
Yeah. Ooh, let's make

So, what do you think?

428
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,942
In your professional opinion,
you think we got a shot?

429
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:33,978
I mean, we're talking about
Boyz II Men here.

We want to go and we want
to win.

00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,048
Yeah.
Boyz II Men?

432
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,883
That concert is canceled.
What? Why?

433
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,818
Yeah, yeah, they all got
the flu.

434
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,987
Oh, son of a bitch!
So we did this for nothing?

435
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,188
Well, I mean, no, not nothing.

436
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,890
I mean, guys, look,
we came together in harmony.

437
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,858
You know, if I'm being
honest, I'd rather go back to

438
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,027
the bar and get drunk, than go
to some, you know, concert.

439
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,629
Yes!
You know what, guys?

440
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,497
We can sing at the bar
like we always do.

441
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,865
That's right.
Yeah, but drink.

442
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,634
Oh, yeah.
'Cause I want to drink.
