1
00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:02,798
We are
looking at one of the most

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:06,425
powerful storm systems ever to hit
the Philadelphia area, folks.

3
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:09,011
As the hurricane moves up the
East Coast, we're already

4
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:12,745
starting to feel its impact with
heavy winds, and everyone is

5
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,957
bracing themselves for
torrential rainfall.

6
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:17,947
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,013
I've never seen
anything of this magnitude.

8
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,048
I can't believe how
severe this is.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,915
They get bigger
and bigger every year.

10
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:26,046
We're expecting
20 to 30 inches.

11
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,216
Philadelphia,
this is dangerous.

12
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:29,917
Stay indoors and be safe.

13
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:32,857
Well, I, for one, would like to
meet this Jackie Denardo and

14
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,793
see if her breasts are
as staggering in person.

15
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,132
Guys, maybe we
should get a 3-D TV.

16
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:40,368
The breasts are only going to
keep getting bigger, and we need

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,069
the latest technology
to keep up.

18
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,570
Are you
guys kidding me?

19
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:45,904
You're focused on boobies at a
time when a massive storm is

20
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:46,705
about to hit Philadelphia?

21
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:48,576
It's a hurricane
we're talking about.

22
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:50,778
Oh, she's talking about it and,
you know, we're sort of

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,547
listening and we're
enjoying her breasts.

24
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:53,449
Just let us have this.

25
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:57,321
The breasts make you care about the
weather in a really good way, not...

26
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,590
Guys, maybe she's right.

27
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,992
I mean, maybe we are too focused
on this woman's breasts.

28
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,496
Switch it to the
other news channel.

29
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,997
<i>Amigos, tenemos...</i> <i>Ho!</i>

44
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:29,017
<i>Yeah, it's media hype hyping up
the storm, making people all</i>

45
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:29,685
<i>nervous about it.</i>

46
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,453
<i>I don't know, Frank, I don't
think this is hype 'cause</i>

47
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:33,188

storm of the century.</i>

48

um, because you might be</i>

49
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,926

coverage was a little bit more extensive.</i>

51
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,417

Ho, look at that!</i>

52
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,413
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

53
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,568

55
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:12,801
I'm broadcasting to you live
from the All American Home

56
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:16,836
Center where shoppers are facing
long lines to buy supplies for

57
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:19,451
the hurricane expected...
They're talking about evacuating the city.

58
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:21,538
Guys, maybe this is more
serious than we thought.

59
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,640
Yeah, it's serious, it's
a category five storm.

60
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,108
We've got to get ready.

61
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,475
Oh, shit.

62
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,611
Dude, maybe the
Mexicans were right.

63
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:29,879
What are you talking about?

64
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,349
The Mexicans predicted that the
world was going to end in 2012.

65
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,484
That was the Mayans, dude.

66
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:36,319
Mayans, Mexicans--
what's the difference?

67
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,187
One difference is that
the Mayans are extinct.

68
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,323
Yeah, the Mexicans
killed the Mayans.

69
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:44,226
No, the Spaniards banged the
Mayans, turned 'em into Mexicans.

70
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,328
Oh, guys, this
doesn't look good.

71
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,297
Okay, we're now getting
unconfirmed reports of sporadic

72
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,333
looting in cities
along the East Coast.

73
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,267
People are looting now?

74
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:53,934
Come on.

75
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:55,135
Ah, it's the media.

76
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:57,670
They hype the storm,
they hype the looting.

77
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:58,404
It's all for ratings.

78
00:02:58,406 --> 00:02:59,405
Whatever.

79
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,407
Either way, I think we should
head up to higher ground, you

80
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,241
know, go to the Poconos.

81
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:03,976
No, you don't want to
go up in the mountains.

82
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:04,643
Are you crazy?

83
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,111
That's just putting you
closer to the storm.

84
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:08,346
You want to go low,
low as can be.

85
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:09,481
All right, you know what?

86
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,283
We got to stop pussydicking
around here, okay?

87
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:12,718
It's time to get in the bunker.

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,755
Bunker, what bunker?

89
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:19,825
Yeah, we, uh, we converted this
old storage closet into a

90
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:22,127
place where we could
ride out Y2K.

91
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:26,797
Ha, Y2K-- perfect example of how
the press hypes everything

92
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,032
to no end and nothing happens.

93
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,767
Well, we know that now, Frank, but
back then we were pretty scared.

94
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,703
Yeah, but why were we so scared?

95
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:35,439
Well, Dee got us all worked up
about the computers taking

96
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,941
over mankind and then she
had us build this bunker.

97
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:40,277
Yeah, robopocalypse-- machines
communicating with each

98
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,779
other and conspiring to
destroy the human race.

99
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,981
That is complete
nonsense, Deandra.

100
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:45,982
Is it nonsense?

101
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:48,717
Is it nonsense, or is it
nonsense that we rely solely on

102
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,020
computers to run every
aspect of our lives, huh?

103
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,021
Hysterical, she's hysterical.

104
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:53,822
Calm down, Dee.

105
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,624
Here, come check
out the bunker.

106
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,627
It's pretty cool.

107
00:03:58,629 --> 00:03:59,661
What the hell?

108
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,897
What the hell happened
to the bunker?

109
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,066
We, uh, we raided the
bunker directly after Y2K.

110
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,801
Well, now it's empty, now there's
nothing in here for us to use.

111
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,236
And why is there a condom
wrapper on the floor?

112
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,004
Uh, you've probably been
banging in the bunker, right?

113
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,005
Guilty.

114
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,472
I've been watching
him bang in here.

115
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:15,139
Have you?

116
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:15,806
Weird, weird.

117
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,474
The bunker is for emergencies.

118
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:18,242
This is not a joke.

119
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:19,909
Yeah, well, whatever, you know.

120
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,711
Yeah, that's an
emergency, I guess.

121
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:24,013
I see that somebody's also been
eating a lot of your weird

122
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,615
canned foods and
sardines, Charlie.

123
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:26,616
Yeah, where's all my...?

124
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,685
Yeah, well, he was probably down
here with Mac, watching you

125
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:30,654
rape girls and
eating pickled eggs.

126
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:31,888
I don't rape girls, come on.

127
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,525
Yeah, and I don't eat that many pickled eggs, but...
Well, you know what?

128
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,260
Let's stock up on some more
pickled eggs down here, though.

129
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:37,928
That's a good idea.

130
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,529
Let's go to the All
American Home store.

131
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,598
We can get all of
our supplies there.

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,265
The All American?

133
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,266
Yeah.

134
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:46,735
That's the place with the weather...
Yeah.

135
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:47,736
Let's go there.

136
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:48,403
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,104
Let's go there.

138
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:54,675
Wait, you're gonna actually go
where the media is advertising?

139
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:57,377
Oh, come on, Frank, it's not like
we've never been to the All

140
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,512
American Home Center before.

141
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:01,014
It's in our minds, you know,
and she's in my mind.

142
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,148
Let's go there, it's settled.

143
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,182
Right, I know, but first we
need to board up windows, so,

144
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,585
Frank, you help me with this
plywood and you guys can each

145
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:10,689
grab a box over there and then we'll...
And they have left, they have left now.

146
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:16,194
I'm only still here 'cause
I'm not as quick as them.

147
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,328
Is that a pickled egg?

148
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,165
No, it's an egg I
brought from home.

149
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:25,769
Attention, all All American
Home Center shoppers...

150
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,070
People seem pretty amped up.

151
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,872
We should get our supplies
before they sell out.

152
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,941
Yeah, for sure, you know, we
should come up with a plan and

153
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:32,910
we should divide up.

154
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,478
Oh, my God.

155
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,547
Oh, they're spectacular.

156
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,949
Imagine that image in 3-D.

157
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,950
Oh, baby.

158
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,184
Yeah, my God.

159
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,420
Guys, I'm telling you, we should
get one of these 3-D TVs.

160
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,188
Yeah, totally, but
not now, okay?

161
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,258
We can't spend our
money on a 3-D TV.

162
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,326
Right, right, all right, we got
to get the supplies, head up

163
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:49,927
to the Poconos ASAP.

164
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:50,594
Come on.

165
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,196
I don't know, I mean,
let's think about this.

166
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,198
I mean, for all we know, it
could be the end of days.

167
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,266
No, it's not the end of days.

168
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,033
I don't want to go uphill.

169
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:57,969
Guys, it's not the end of days.

170
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,338
Calm down, it's
just a storm, okay?

171
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,273
We-We'll get some batteries,
we'll get some supplies.

172
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,843
Food, we'll get food.

173
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:05,843
Yeah, we'll get food.

174
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,544
Okay, but I feel like you
did-- you didn't say food.

175
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:08,312
Yeah, we'll get food, okay?

176
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:08,979
Jesus Christ.

177
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:09,980
Relax.

178
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:11,881
Okay, yeah, I'm,
I'm getting crazy.

179
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:12,816
All right, I'll get the food.

180
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:13,483
Yeah-- oh, my God.

181
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,250
You guys get the supplies.

182
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,051
Okay, we'll get the supplies.

183
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,052
Okay.

184
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:19,422
Okay, give us the cash because...
No, no, it's-- I have Frank's credit card.

185
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,089
You take the cash.

186
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,991
You got the cash, we got
the credit card, let's go.

187
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,926
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

188
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,062
In addition to supplies, might
be nice to grab some girls, you

189
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,430
know, get them back to the bar.

190
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:30,733
This Jackie Denardo chick-- she's,
uh, sparked another storm

191
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,735
inside me if you
know what I mean.

192
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:33,469
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,604
Might be nice to ride the
storm out with some chicks.

194
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,774
Yeah, yeah, and we could use 'em to
repopulate the planet or something.

195
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:39,742
That'll be great to have them.

196
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,210
I'm not going to entertain
this notion anymore.

197
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:42,144
I don't want to hear it.

198
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,547
Okay, I'd at least like to find
one, like, Mexican or Mayan

199
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,482
or something for predictions.

200
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,450
No, but get some
batteries, though.

201
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:50,328
You be the battery guy and I'll
be the, the chicks and tits guy.

202
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,589
All right.

203
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:56,464
Frank!

204
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,466
Frank, you want to come
help me do this or what?

205
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,981
No, come over here.
I want you to see this.

206
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,355
Frank...
Come on, check this out.

207
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:04,332
At any moment, hoards of maniacs could
come pouring through the windows.

208
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,185
This doesn't concern you?

209
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,209
Come on, Deandra.

210
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,238
Please come over here and
sit down, look at this.

211
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,239
Oh! What?

212
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:12,057
You remember years ago there
was a storm in New Orleans?

213
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:13,951
Hurricane Katrina?

214
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,665
- Yes.
- Yeah, I remember it. Mm-hmm.

215
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:16,778
Okay, check this out.

216
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:19,256
What do you think those people
are doing, surviving or looting?

217
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,060
They're surviving.

218
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,061
Ah. Okay.

219
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:26,297
Do you remember a man
named Rodney King?

220
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:27,298
Yes, of course I do.

221
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay, the LAPD worked
him over really good.

222
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:30,801
Yes.

223
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:32,903
Okay. This was taken during
the Rodney King riots.

224
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:36,306
What do you think these people
are doing, looting or surviving?

225
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,242
Well, they're looting.

226
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,277
Ah, of course.

227
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,545
Well, it's the media, see?

228
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:44,247
When it's white people, it's
survival, and when it's black

229
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,181
people, it's looting.

230
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:47,250
No, Frank, it's because the white
people are stealing bread,

231
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,185
and the black people
are stealing speakers.

232
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,953
If the white people were
stealing stereo equipment, I

233
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:52,722
would say they
were looting, too.

234
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,392
How do you know the blacks don't
have bread in those speakers?

235
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:56,226
What are you talking about?

236
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,061
What are we talking
about right now?

237
00:07:58,063 --> 00:07:58,895
There are big things to do.

238
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:00,831
Oh, okay, all right, listen,
listen, listen, okay, calm down.

239
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,833
This is the best part.

240
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:02,833
More?

241
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,669
Oh, yeah, just check this out.

242
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,503
This was taken
during the riots.

243
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,338
Do you recognize
anybody in there?

244
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,173
What are you doing in the video?

245
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,842
I happened to be out in L.A.
during the riots.

246
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:11,842
I was on business.

247
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,678
And to steal ski
equipment, I guess.

248
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,413
Yeah, well, I went in for a loaf
of bread, I took some skis.

249
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:16,414
Everybody's happy.

250
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,249
Not the people who own the skis.

251
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:19,250
Oh, shit.

252
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:22,020
All right, all right, calm...
Oh, my God, the power went out!

253
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,021
Calm down.

254
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,023
This is terrible!

255
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:24,857
We got to get at...

256
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:25,692
Jesus! Goddamn it.

257
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,393
That's why I like to have
this little baby with me.

258
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:30,329
Come on. I'm go...
All right, let's go to the bunker... bunker.

259
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:31,330
You come with me.

260
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,164
Yeah, go first. Don't.

261
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,165
Just be careful with that.

262
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,167
We're gonna call it
a hurricane party.

263
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,168
It's gonna be cool.

264
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,169
It's gonna be awesome, yeah.

265
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:38,171
What's a hurricane party?

266
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:39,839
A hurricane party's exactly
what it sounds like.

267
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,641
It's a party during a hurricane
at our bar, Paddy's Pub.

268
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:42,509
Oh, I've heard of that bar.

269
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,510
Yeah?

270
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,579
Hey!  Hello!

271
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,981
All right, all right! Hi.

272
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,983
Crazy, crazy weather
coming our way.

273
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:50,984
Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,652
You trying to get these girls
down to the bunker, or...?

275
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:55,488
Oh, no, I'm inviting them back
to our very cool bar we own.

276
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,489
Oh, cool, cool.

277
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,326
Yeah, we got a
sweet bunker, too.

279
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,095
Yeah, well... It's, like, so secure,
people can't get in or out if we don't

280
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:03,029
want 'em to.

281
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,831
We'll be, like, totally
safe down there.

282
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,831
Yeah.

283
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,665
I got a bunch of supplies.

284
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,500
You guys like pickled eggs?

285
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,235
Sardines, too... Yeah, we got a bunch
of other, you know, normal food and

286
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:11,002
normal stuff there, too.

287
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:11,836
Yeah.

288
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:12,671
Yeah, it's a great bar.

289
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,572
Gonna be free drinks for
everybody, so you know, you'll

290
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,509
come, you'll party with us, and you can
bring your girlfriends, too, you know?

291
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:18,510
Sure.

292
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:20,512
We don't want
just the two of you.

293
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,514
You got to bring
your girlfriends.

294
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:23,515
That's a requirement.

295
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:24,515
Sounds like fun.

296
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,083
Can our boyfriends come, too?

297
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:28,887
Oh.

298
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,188
Your boyfriends?

299
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,224
Yeah, our boyfriends.

300
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:38,028
You two have boyfriends?

301
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:45,601
How did you not know...
that the reason I invited you back to my bar...

302
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:48,204
was to bang you?

303
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:49,405
Get out of here!

304
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:50,673
Get the hell out of here!

305
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,707
Get... Get out of here!

306
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:52,708
Shoo away from me!

307
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,710
You're a dick.

308
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:54,711
<i>You're</i> a dick.

309
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:56,713
She's a... I'm not a dick. <i>Oh!</i>

310
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,715
<i>It's okay.</i>

311
00:09:58,717 --> 00:09:59,549
<i>Take it easy, all right?</i>

312
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,550
<i>What was that?</i>

313
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:01,552
<i>That was too dark.</i>

314
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:02,553
<i>They lied to me.</i>

315
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,388
<i>Oh, okay, well, just
let it go, all right?</i>

316
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,123
<i>If you want to entice these
ladies, you got to talk about</i>

317
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,992
<i>the bunker, you got to
lead with the bunker...</i>

318
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:10,562
<i>No. You</i> <i>end</i> with the bunker,
or you don't talk about the bunker at all.

319
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:11,429
Are you kidding me?

320
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,297
What are you wearing?

321
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,132
Dude, they have
amazing stuff here.

322
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,132
I'm totally prepared.

323
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,134
Check this out.

324
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,135
How sweet is that?

325
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:18,969
Dude... No, drop the...
Are you kidding me?

326
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,137
You think girls are gonna want to
come back to a bar with a man

327
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,106
dressed the way you're dressed
and carrying a hatchet?

328
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,108
Yeah. They're gonna be, like,
"Look at this sweet dude, his

329
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,409
awesome gear and his
awesome hatchet.

330
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:28,510
He's prepared, he's
ready for anything.

331
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,745
Storm coming? Hatchet coming."

332
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:30,745
Dude, I have an idea.

333
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,747
I'm gonna go to the
office section.

334
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,148
Meet me in the office section.

335
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,149
Okay. All right, good.

336
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,151
I'll find Mac, 'cause we got
to get out of here, man.

337
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,152
Okay, yeah, no, no.

338
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,154
Um, let's loose the hatchet.

339
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:43,191
Come on, man. The...
I got another hatchet.

340
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,192
Don't you worry about that.

341
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:46,828
Dark as shit in here.

342
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,962
It's very creepy.

343
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,165
Let's just get to the bunker.

344
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,134
What was that? Was that a rat?

345
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:57,204
It was a looter.
Loot... Behind us.

346
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:00,874
Oh, a looter! Looter! Shoot him!

347
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:02,876
No, don't shoot! It's Cricket!

348
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,879
Ooh, no!

349
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:07,880
Cricket.

350
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,949
Oh, what are you doing
down here, Cricket?

351
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,418
I come down the
bunker sometimes when it rains.

352
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,421
Oh, we got to get him
to the hospital.

353
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,457
No, I ain't going
to no hospital.

354
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,658
They euthanize the homeless.

355
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,792
They're goddamned death mps!

356
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:20,794
You got no hand, Cricket.

357
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:21,795
I have a hand, Frank.

358
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:23,797
It's-It's a little...
I have a hole in it. Big deal.

359
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,799
Oh, Frank, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

360
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,534
I don't really want to go to the
hospital, either, you know,

361
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,203
because we're gonna be there
when the hurricane hits, and

362
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,972
it's gonna be packed to
the gills with vagrants.

363
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:31,973
Are you out of your mind?!

364
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,808
This man is bleeding
to death here.

365
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,810
Well, okay, oh, you
know what we could do?

366
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,545
We could dress him up and take
him upstairs, and then the

367
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,213
looters would think he's the
owner of the bar, and they'd

368
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,882
have their way with him, and if
he died, you know, it's on them,

369
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:41,816
and-and not on us.

370
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:42,817
That-That's good.

371
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,818
Let's just do that.

372
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,819
Don't listen to him!

373
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:45,820
He's delirious!

374
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:46,655
You're bleeding out, Cricket!

375
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:48,656
It's nothing...
Frank, this is nothing.

376
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:49,657
Goddamn it!

377
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,293
All right, Cricket, all right, fine,
we'll go, we'll go to the hospital.

378
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,028
Frank, we are coming right back
here after we drop him off, to

379
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,630
be where we are safe in the
bunker where we belong, okay?

380
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,630
Let's go!

381
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,631
Okay, get out.

382
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,801
You're marching me to the ovens.

383
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,254
Dennis!

384
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:05,942
There you are, dude.

385
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:07,892
Dude, things are getting
kind of bad in here, man.

386
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,196
Like, people are all
worked up, right?

387
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:10,338
I'm been trying to find Mac.

388
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,174
He's not answering
my phone calls.

389
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,242
I went out to the parking lot to
see if he was out there hiding

390
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:15,176
out in the car or something.

391
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,178
He took off! Car's gone!

392
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,012
Mm, well, clearly, he's
evacuated to the Poconos.

393
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:19,848
Do you really think
he'd do that to us?

394
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,682
Absolutely do that to us.

395
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,683
I don't know.

396
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:22,685
This is bad, dude.

397
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:23,686
What you got here?

398
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:24,687
What you working on?

399
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:25,521
Oh, uh, this is great.

400
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,356
This is an agreement
for the women.

401
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:28,357
Oh.

402
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,093
Yeah, it guarantees that
whoever comes back to the bar

403
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,028
with us agrees to follow all
the rules that we set forth.

404
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,029
Well, that's smart.

405
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:33,863
Walk me through the details.

406
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:34,864
What you got, Dennis?

407
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,699
Uh, it's all very simple,
Charlie, very simple stuff.

408
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,700
Um, "I... state your name..."

409
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:38,701
Charlie Kelly.

410
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:39,702
Hmm? Well, not your name.

411
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:40,703
Oh.

412
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:41,705
Their name.

413
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:45,208
"Being of sound mind and body, do
solemnly pledge that I do not

414
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,376
have a boyfriend.

415
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:49,445
Nor am I currently engaged in a
sexual relationship with another

416
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,814
individual, females excluded."

417
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:51,814
Right.

418
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:54,183
"I hereby agree to be easygoing,
to engage in playful

419
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,887
conversation, to always act as though I
desire your penis even when I don't."

420
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:58,888
Yeah?

421
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,890
And it sort of goes on and
on like that for a while.

422
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:01,924
I love it. Where do I sign?

423
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:04,960
Okay, again, um, you
don't sign anywhere.

424
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:08,030
If we're doing a contract, I want to sign it, so...
This isn't a contract for

425
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:08,965
you, Charlie.

426
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:09,966
Uh, it's not?

427
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:20,311
This is a contract... ♪ Till now I always
got by on my own I never really cared

428
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:32,957
♪ Until I met you And now it chills me
to the bone How do I get you alone? ♪

429
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:36,861
Oh, my God.

430
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,463
Charlie, I might be in love with
this woman-- not for the right

431
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,064
reasons, mind you.

432
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:40,731
I got an idea.

433
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:41,732
Yeah.

434
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:44,034
Let's get her back to
the bunker, right?

435
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:47,236
She's the perfect kind of woman
to start over the new world with.

436
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,105
We would create a race of super
giant-breasted women, you know?

437
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,774
I'd start sleeping with your
daughters, you'd sleep with my

438
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,376
daughters, I'd sleep with your
daughters' daughters, you'd

439
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:52,976
sleep with my daughters'

440
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:53,978
daughters.

441
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,780
We die, our sons would sleep
with our daughters' daughters'

442
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:56,781
daughters.

443
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:57,548
It's like a perfect society.

444
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,317
Okay, I see where you're going
with that, but it sounds

445
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,186
like it could get
a little messy.

446
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,788
It could get a little stick...
let's work out a new agreement, you know...

447
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,323
All right, we'll come up
with a separate agreement.

448
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,992
Who sleeps with whose daughter?

449
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:07,659
Okay, that sounds good.

450
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:09,494
Um, all right, I'm gonna go
talk to this woman, you know?

451
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,161
All right, okay, okay.

452
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:11,463
All right.

453
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,731
Um... I got to say, man, this
woman's, like, really throwing

454
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,734
me off, dude, I feel
very, very nervous.

455
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:16,501
I don't usually get nervous.

456
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:17,569
You want me to help you out?

457
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,236
Yeah... no.

458
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,170
I'll go over there with you.

459
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:22,306
No, no, no, I want you to stay
as far away from me as possible.

460
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,908
You're standing too close
to me as it is, actually.

461
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,842
Have you gotten
into the cheese?

462
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,543
There's a whole cheese section.

463
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:27,210
I bet there is.

464
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:27,878
I went nuts.

465
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,645
All right, well, you stink.

466
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,414
Mm-hmm, all right,
you know what?

467
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,349
I'll find Frank,
he'll pick us up.

468
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,249
Okay, yeah, go call Frank.

469
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,453
I'm gonna go talk to the, uh...
I don't think I can do it

470
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,087
dressed like this, though.

471
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,757
I look ridiculous.

472
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:45,530
You guys, I don't mean to be a bother,
but are we almost at the hospital?

473
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:46,531
Shut the hell up, Cricket!

474
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,600
Okay, I'm driving
as fast as I can!

475
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:49,801
Do you not see that?!

476
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,337
Move!

477
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,471
What are you doing, Frank?

478
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:54,238
What are you doing, Frank?

479
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,206
I'm getting air.

480
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,141
You're sucking it all
up with your panicking.

481
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:57,841
It's freezing outside.

482
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,377
You're gonna catch cold and then everyone's
going to get sick in the bunker.

483
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,145
What are you talking
about, freezing?

484
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,546
It's sunny as shit.

485
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,615
Will you calm down,
for crying out loud?

486
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:07,583
You're gonna give
me a heart attack.

487
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:09,585
Oh, all right.

488
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:10,586
Let's go.

489
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:11,653
It's Charlie.

490
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:14,190
Yo.

491
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,091
You're shitting me.

492
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,259
Huh?

493
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:18,527
God.

494
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,298
Mac went to the Poconos, left
them stranded by the All

495
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,632
American with the supplies.

496
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:24,633
With the supplies?

497
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:28,070
No, n-n-n-no, I'm not getting stranded
in the bunker with no supplies.

498
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,643
You guys, what about me?

499
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,280
I'm in pain, I'm in... Goddamn you,
Cricket, goddamn you, it's not about you!

500
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,949
Listen, I'm gonna pick up the guys,
then I'll drop you off at the hospital.

501
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,718
It's gonna take two
seconds, okay?!

502
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,822
Is that okay, Cricket,
with you, huh?!

503
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:44,823
Go!

504
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,659
Come on, come on,
get out of the way.

505
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,426
I don't want to die.

506
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:54,365
Don't make me do it, Cricket,
I will slice you in half.

507
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,135
As you can see behind me, Larry, the storm
is really taking its toll on weary shoppers.

508
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:02,271
The lines are still long as
frustrated customers wait

509
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:05,874
anxiously to return home with
some emergency supplies before

510
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:08,043
the worst of the storm hits.

511
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:11,447
Jackie Denardo, Channel 5 News.

512
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,548
We out?

513
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,549
Good.

514
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,320
Hi, hi, hi.

515
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,856
I'm Dennis... Reynolds.

516
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,025
Hi, hi, Dennis.

517
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:29,131
I have a bar, I own a bar, it's my bar,
and I wanted to invite you to it for...

518
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:32,201
Uh, we have food and supplies,
and it would be a good place...

519
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:36,038
This storm is going to be bad,
as you know, so why not be at

520
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,309
the bar with me, um, and, you
know, for the good of the race?

521
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,545
So come to the bar and, uh,
oh, and I have a contr-- an

522
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:45,080
agreement, and I need you to sign...
Uh, excuse me, sir.

523
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,081
Yes.

524
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:46,849
Yeah, it's about the storm.

525
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,850
Okay.

526
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,619
Storm's not going to hit Philly.

527
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:50,386
It's just going to drizzle.

528
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,387
Really?

529
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:52,388
Yeah.

530
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,989
How am I supposed to
turn that into news?

531
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,859
I don't know, find some other way
to make these people go nuts.

532
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:57,526
We need a story.

533
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,628
Okay, thanks.

534
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,631
Hey, Todd, storm's
just been downgraded.

535
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,533
Apparently we're just going
to get a light drizzle.

536
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:05,534
Goddamn it.

537
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,469
I have a bunker.

538
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,070
Maybe we can turn this
into global warming.

539
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,505
That always gets people
whipped up, huh?

540
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,041
Get, get, get...
if you get in the bunker with me, then,

541
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,642
then you'll be totally safe.

542
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,178
For the good of the race,
we can create an entire...

543
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,247
Oh, my God, get lost, creep!

544
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:30,491
You're gonna treat
me like a dog, huh?

545
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:34,195
You're gonna treat
Cricket like a dog?

546
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:36,798
Hospital.

547
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,201
Hospital.

548
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,836
Come on... come on.

549
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:42,070
Hurry it up, move it along.

550
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:42,738
He's taking forever.

551
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,405
We're gonna die.

552
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:44,340
Hey, you look kind of Mayan.

553
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:45,941
You wouldn't happen to
be a Mayan, would you?

554
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:46,609
Charlie, there you are.

555
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:47,543
I think I found a Mayan.

556
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:48,978
We've been looking
all over for you.

557
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,413
Cricket's out in the car
bleeding like a pig.

558
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,414
Seriously?

559
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,015
We got to get the
supplies right away.

560
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:54,950
I got a great
amount of supplies.

561
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,319
I've been getting all sorts
of stuff, like things...

562
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:59,221
Hey, hey, hey, that's my cart.

563
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:02,358
Hey, folks, folks, listen up,
I'm sorry, but our credit card

564
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,026
machines just went down
due to a system overload.

565
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:06,094
We can only accept
cash at this time.

566
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:06,762
Oh, shit.

567
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:07,763
What?

568
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:08,530
Okay, well, you got cash?

569
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,197
I only have cards.

570
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,133
Charlie, where's the
cash I gave you?

571
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:13,068
Mac took off with all our cash!

572
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,735
He just took off!

573
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:14,736
What?!

574
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:15,404
We're gonna die.

575
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:18,240
I told you, I told you, I told
you we're dependant on machines.

576
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,876
You guys, once the machines go
down, then society collapses.

577
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:21,811
We're going to hell
in a handcart.

578
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:23,580
Okay, okay, I got a plan, okay,
let's just start looting

579
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,281
shit, okay, let's
just grab shit.

580
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:25,949
Yes, yes!

581
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,751
Let's just grab whatever we can.

582
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:30,120
No, you can't loot until the
crowd whips up into a frenzy.

583
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,722
The crowd is whipped
up into a frenzy.

584
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:32,489
They just stole my cart!

585
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,558
I-I think the time
will be evident.

586
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,326
Well, what are we waiting for?!

587
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:40,464
I don't know.

588
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,301
Loot, loot, time to loot, loot!

589
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,337
Loot, loot!

590
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,839
Take everything!

591
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,908
Kill the machines!

592
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,644
Kill the machines!

593
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,713
It's their fault!

594
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:58,384
Kill the machines...!

595
00:18:58,386 --> 00:18:59,619
Come on, come on, come on.

596
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,354
Get it, get it, get it.

597
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:04,624
Just seconds ago, a car crashed
through the building and the

598
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,226
crowd is scattering.

599
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,663
Despite the fact that the storm
has been downgraded, the people

600
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,266
have worked themselves into
an uncontrollable frenzy!

601
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:16,270
It's the end of days,
it's the end of days!

602
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:17,772
Pandemonium has struck.

603
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,573
Come to the
bunker, come to the bunker!

604
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,077
Dennis, I got her,
Dennis, I got her!

605
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,245
Is this the hospital?

606
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,479
Is this the hospital?

607
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,548
Ah.

608
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:33,219
3-D boobies.

609
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,354
Now, this is news.

610
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:51,237
