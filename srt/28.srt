1
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:04,821
Oh, wow, dude.
This thing is disgusting.

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:07,084
There's so much rust. Maybe we
should wipe it with a wet rag.

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:09,422
I'm not gonna do that!
Why not?

4
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:11,826
Because it's a goddamn circuit
breaker, Mac. We'll get electrocuted.

5
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,591
No, I'm just gonna use
this screwdriver, all right?

6
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,394
It's got a rubber handle.
That'll keep me grounded.

7
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,900
No, I'm pretty sure you have
to be standing on rubber.

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,699
Well, the bottoms of my shoes are
rubber. Oh, no! You know what it is?

9
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,569
You can't be standing
on the ground at all.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,835
Maybe you should jump up
into midair and do it. Hmm?

11
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,469
Yeah. If you jump into the
air and grab a live wire...

12
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:29,536
you... won't
get electrocuted.

13
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:32,174
But then if you land on the ground
and you're still holding that wire...

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,512
you'll be blown to bits.

15
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,211
I saw it in Tango and Cash.

16
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,481
So I'm supposed to risk my
life based on something...

17
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,352
that you saw in the
movie Tango and Cash?

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,120
Kurt Russell... I think... All right, I'm
gonna jam this thing with a screwdriver.

19
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:44,184
All right? The rubber handle
will ground me. And I'll be safe.

20
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:45,251
All right.
All right.

21
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,319
Give it a shot.
Okay.

22
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:47,830
It's all set to scrape...
Oh, my God!

23
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,298
Holy shit!

24
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,857
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wh-What
the hell are you doing?

25
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:53,028
It exploded.
You're making it worse!

26
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:54,867
Bro, you gotta pay
somebody to fix this, man.

27
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,600
No! I'm tired of
spending my money...

28
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:58,904
every time something
goes wrong in this place.

29
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,671
Well, we can't fix it,
Frank! It's too dangerous!

30
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:03,145
It scared the shit out of me,
man. Well, get Charlie to do it.

31
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:05,842
He won't go near the thing. He's already
been electrocuted, like, 500 times.

32
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,817
Yeah, man. I think he's
starting to catch on to that.

33
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:11,321
Dennis, get me a harness 'cause I'll
have to be swinging in the air to do this.

34
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:12,651
Are you kidding me?
I told you.

35
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,055
Bro, did you
get the flashlights?

36
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,855
Forget about the flashlights!
Check these bad boys out!

37
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:18,156
They fell off the back of a truck.
Huh?

38
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,663
Nice grab. All right. But
what about the flashlights?

39
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,461
Uh, I'm sorry. Someone wasn't
paying attention, right?

40
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,592
Free speakers, dude! Free speakers
for the bar! Free speakers!

41
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,159
Mac, let's plug
these bad boys in.

42
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:27,727
Yeah!
We don't have any electricity!

43
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:29,568
That's why we needed
the flashlight. Careful!

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,665
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

45
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,870
Holy shit.
What is that?

46
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,871
Oh, my God.
Whoa.

47
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:38,575
That's a...
big bag of drugs.

48
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:41,413
This is not good, dude. Somebody's
gonna be looking for those drugs.

49
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,351
Relax, dude. They're gonna be
shit out of luck 'cause no one...

50
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:45,355
No one saw us take
the speakers. Did they?

51
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,653
See us take...
No.

52
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:50,159
There you have it. Look,
let's not worry or panic.

53
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:52,856
This is...
This is a lot of drugs.

54
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,490
But, like, what's the
worst that could happen?

55
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,128
Gotta get rid of it.
Yeah. Drugs are bad news.

56
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:34,671
Let's get rid of it.
Throw it in the garbage.

57
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,536
Ooh, you can't do that 'cause
a kid could find it. Right.

58
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,576
Burn it. Well, then we're
dealing with a fume situation.

59
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,737
Yeah. You gotta wear masks and...
Yeah, it's a whole thing and...

60
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,713
It's a whole production. It's a big
production. All right, then bury it!

61
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,772
Oh, well... No, see. Now
we're back to the kids again.

62
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,148
Because kids run with shovels,
playing in dirt. Absolutely.

63
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,517
And then one of them's
gonna... Okay. Call the police.

64
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,079
What, are we gonna just
solve society's drug problem?

65
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:54,624
You know what I mean?
Is that on us?

66
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,091
No!
Is that on us now?

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,650
The community is still
going down the toilet.

68
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,662
So I think what you're
saying, Sweet Dee, is that...

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,221
we could use the unsolvable drug
problem in our society... Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,894
To fix the solvable
light problem in our bar.

71
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:06,436
Yes.
Absolutely. I hear you.

72
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,301
We're saying we're gonna
do the drugs...

73
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,930
and then we're gonna try
and fix all the lights. No.

74
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,565
Charlie didn't understand
that. That's asinine.

75
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,234
You want to rewind? Yeah,
we're gonna flip the drugs.

76
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:16,246
Make a bunch of money. Use that
money to fix the electricity. Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,339
All right. Well, both ways
work. I kinda like my way.

78
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,576
Great plan.
Your way's terrible.

79
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,049
I'm in. Let's sell these
drugs. You're not in.

80
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,676
Whoop. Thank you. And
you're not gonna sell them.

81
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,721
We'll do it, Charlie.
Because we found the drugs.

82
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,188
And you're bossy.
Very bossy.

83
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:28,225
I'm not bossy.
Scumbags!

84
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,260
Frank, come on, man. Look,
we're trying to get some money...

85
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,228
to fix the lights in our bar
because you won't give it to us.

86
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,892
Back in my day, only the biggest
pieces of shit dealt drugs.

87
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,435
We're not gonna deal drugs.
Yeah, right.

88
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,767
We're gonna flip it. We'll flip
it once. It's a onetime flip.

89
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,703
Yeah. We'll go to your... that
shady guy Bingo that you know.

90
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,741
Oh, Bingo. We'll say, you
know, "Here's a pile of drugs.

91
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,538
Give us some money. " And then...
Uhhuh.

92
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:49,409
Oh, no, no, no. You don't go
to Bingo. Bingo is my contact.

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,345
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't
think you can call dibs...

94
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,076
on a shady peoplesmuggler.
You can't do that.

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,641
Just do not mention my name!

96
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,314
My God. Relax, dude. No
one's gonna mention your name.

97
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,949
Hey, Bingo.
Frank sent us.

98
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:04,620
Frank, huh? I'm gonna skin that
son of a bitch and wear his face.

99
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:06,390
Anyway, what's up?
Well, we're trying...

100
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,125
Oh, don't look at me.
Excuse me?

101
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,427
Look up. Up.
Okay.

102
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,933
Is this good?
That's fine.

103
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,266
Now speak.
Uh, okay.

104
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,774
Uh, well, listen, Bingo. We got a
bucket of nose clams fresh from the sea.

105
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,608
Sweet, delicious nose clams that are
looking for a home if you follow me.

106
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,613
Nose clams?
No. I don't follow you.

107
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,444
I don't know what the hell you're
talking about. I don't follow either.

108
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,008
Yes, you do. It's not confusing.
Just everybody settle down.

109
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:33,182
These are the kind of nose clams that
make you want to dance the night away.

110
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:35,088
I don't get what the
hell you're talking about.

111
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,286
I don't even know what you're
talking about. It's so obvious!

112
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,488
You know what? It's not obvious.
Now you're being too vague.

113
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:41,589
You're talking about
dancing clams in the...

114
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,361
What's gonna make you dance?

115
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:46,335
These are the kind of nose clams that
you crush up into a line of white powder.

116
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,929
And you snort them up through
your nose. And they make you high.

117
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:52,203
You use a dollar bill or a straw
to do it. They come from Colombia.

118
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,676
They're illegal. And they
rhyme with "propane. "

119
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,679
Perfect. You found a
perfect medium ground there.

120
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,544
So you want to sell me cocaine?
Yes!

121
00:04:58,616 --> 00:04:59,878
Why didn't you just
come out and say that?

122
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,543
Instead of dancing around
it. That is so tacky.

123
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:04,213
We talked about it in the car.
It's a thing you do. It's not tacky.

124
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:07,985
That is the kindergarten behavior of
drug dealing. Do you want them or not?

125
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,959
Yeah, of course I do. Oh,
great. Well, here you go.

126
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,188
Thank you. Eyes, boom.
Yeah.

127
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,134
Oh!
Oh!

128
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,534
Youse two. We need
to talk to Youse. Huh?

129
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:22,664
Oh, shit.
Are you guys gangsters?

130
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,798
Shut up!

131
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,933
Ah, owe me a Coke.
Listen...

132
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,274
rumor has it that somebody
who works at this bar...

133
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,473
found a certain somethin'
that belongs to us.

134
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:34,484
A certain somethin' which may or may
not have fallen off a certain truck, huh?

135
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:37,419
And the certain somebody that we know
thinks they saw that certain someone...

136
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,820
pick it up and take it
back to that certain bar...

137
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,291
which may or may not be the place
that we happen to be or not be...

138
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,921
talkin' to a couple of certain
somebodies right this very second.

139
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,329
Capisce?
Huh?

140
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,467
Fellas, we're about
six beers' deep.

141
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:53,400
So I think you're
gonna have to...

142
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,735
be a little bit more clear 'cause
I didn't get that last part.

143
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:57,899
I m... I missed out on the whole
thing to be honest with you.

144
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,205
I was confused by it. I'm
very confused by the...

145
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,178
I was very confused by the whole
thing to be... if I'm being honest.

146
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:07,081
Look, why don't you just
return what belongs to us...

147
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:11,485
or pay us the 25 G's that it's
worth, and we'll be square.

148
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,352
Youse got
until Friday, huh?

149
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,755
What happens on Friday?

150
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,891
Well, Friday is the day...

151
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,488
that we may
or may not be forced...

152
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,590
to chop your limbs off...

153
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:29,197
and distribute them evenly amongst
your friends and your family.

154
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:31,867
And that's Friday.

155
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,206
Friday.
Okay.

156
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:37,042
Well, thanks, gentlemen. That's...
That's very... a very clear message.

157
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,412
And we will certainly get
on that right away. Yeah.

158
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,576
Okay. That's
muched appreciated.

159
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,483
Uh, good day to youse.

160
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:46,284
And good day to youse. Come on.
Huh?

161
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,325
What's the matter with you?
Chewin' in my ear all the time.

162
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:49,984
Friday.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

163
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,824
Holy shit!

164
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:59,293
Guess who sold the drugs
And we can fix the lights now

165
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,837
The lights are fixed.

166
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,566
Yeah, man.
No shit. How'd you do that?

167
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,232
We got bigger problems
than that, dude.

168
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:06,242
The drugs that you just
sold, they belong to the mob.

169
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,971
What?
Yeah, they saw you guys.

170
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,206
Yeah. Guys, real-life actual
gangsters. It was pretty cool.

171
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,340
They came to the bar. They
threatened us. It was not cool!

172
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,614
Look! The point is, we're gonna give them
the money that you got from Bingo. So it's...

173
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,314
Cool. And then maybe we can
keep a little for ourselves too.

174
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:19,617
Yeah, well, how much
did you get? Perfect.

175
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,089
Oh, dude...
a one, a two...

176
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,785
a $300!
Hello.

177
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,158
You guys, those drugs
were worth 25 grand!

178
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,254
Oh, shit!
Are you serious?

179
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,730
Yes!
Now, see now? I told you.

180
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,391
I asked for more money.
What?

181
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,026
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't!

182
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,731
I was using "Dead Presidents"
as a cover. You didn't get that?

183
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,899
He said to the man he wanted many,
many thousands of green people...

184
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:39,465
From history times.

185
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,340
Oh, my God.
We are so screwed.

186
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,437
How are we gonna get 25
grand by Friday? I get that.

187
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,950
Don't look at me.
You made this bed.

188
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,954
You're sleeping in it. This
is a life lesson for you.

189
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,013
Frank, this is not the time to be
throwing down life lessons, all right?

190
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,286
We are going to get whacked off
by a bunch of scary Italian guys.

191
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,554
Did they say they were
gonna whack us off?

192
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,459
They implied they wanted
to whack us all off! Okay.

193
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,328
Nobody's gonna get whacked
off today, okay? Listen.

194
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,425
We're gonna take the money. We'll
go get our drugs back from Bingo.

195
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:07,664
We'll give it to the mob. And we'll
pretend none of this ever happened.

196
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,137
And this time, I'll
do the talking! Okay.

197
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,400
Just keep my name out of it.

198
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:12,635
Frank said to tell you
to sell us back our drugs.

199
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,075
Okay.
No problem.

200
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,305
Good. Good.
Great.

201
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,505
Excellent.
Problem solved.

202
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,411
$5,000.
What?

203
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:20,882
Oh, boy! Just an hour ago,
you gave us 300 for 'em.

204
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,112
Yeah, man.
Yeah, I don't recall that.

205
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:25,018
Come on!
All right.

206
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,081
What can we get for 300 then?
Uh, you want an exotic bird?

207
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,455
If you're gonna play this game, we
need to buy something from you...

208
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,363
that we can sell back to other
people at a higher price. Yeah.

209
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,423
Okay. OxyContin.

210
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,435
It's a very popular pill
these days.

211
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,698
And I happen to have
a whole shitload of it.

212
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,262
How much?
1,200.

213
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,740
Oh, boy. Wow.
That's gonna...

214
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,176
Bingo! Wow. Goodness
gracious with this guy.

215
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,679
If it's not one thing, it's
another thing. Oh, okay.

216
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:54,081
But think about it this way. If we split
it, it's only a few hundred dollars each.

217
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,676
Great, yeah. Let me just go grab
my cash from my money tree...

218
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,120
that I have planted. I know a
leprechaun who has a pot of gold.

219
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,555
He lives at
the end of my street.

220
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,251
Maybe I'll go to a bank
and say, "Hello.

221
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,089
Do I have an account
here?" Call Donald Trump!

222
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:09,189
How do three men in their 30s
not have $800 between them?

223
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:13,401
They're...
The economy is in shambles.

224
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,234
Have you taken a close look at the
marketplace right now? The NASDAQ!

225
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,740
Dow Jones!
It's up then down.

226
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,538
Stop talking, goddamn
it! Fine! I'll do it!

227
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,408
I'm not getting
my money back, am I?

228
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,310
Give us money.

229
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:26,576
Boom.

230
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,117
What am I supposed
to do with that?

231
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:30,710
You tell us. Yeah. Bingo said
you knew how to sell those drugs.

232
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:33,814
I told you not to involve me in
that! Did you mention my name?

233
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:36,223
First thing we did. First thing we
did. You gonna harp on it all day?

234
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,727
Goddamn it! The guy's
gonna skin me alive.

235
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,764
He is gonna skin you alive. He
mentioned something about it.

236
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,299
Will you just pay the mob off so
we don't have to sell these pills?

237
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,631
Dennis, I am not using
any more of my money!

238
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:48,695
The mob is gonna kill us,
man! Look, if I cave on this...

239
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,172
I'm gonna be bailing you guys
out for the rest of my life.

240
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,971
So... I'm putting my
foot down on this one.

241
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:54,943
You bitches gotta earn
your own money!

242
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,071
Fine! Whatever!
It doesn't matter.

243
00:09:57,147 --> 00:10:00,173
Because... seeing as how I'm
the boss... You're not the boss.

244
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,549
Oh, yes, I am. I've come
up with an excellent idea.

245
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,521
Frank, you are gonna get us into that
country club that you used to belong to.

246
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,284
And we're gonna
sell the pills there.

247
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,690
That'd be a good place to sell those
pills. Yes. Thank you very much.

248
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,820
You can't make no $25,000
from that amount of pills.

249
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:15,263
How long you got?
Till Friday.

250
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,460
Mmmmm. You're gonna have to turn a
trick or two. Go into prostitution.

251
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,265
You are disgusting!
How could you suggest...

252
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:24,671
I am absolutely not doing that!
I wasn't talking about you.

253
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:27,210
Guys at those country clubs
get hotter broads than you.

254
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,007
I would think, yeah.
Yeah.

255
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,106
I was saying the male escort
Is really hard to come by.

256
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:37,017
I'm picking up what you're
putting down. I'll do it. Oh...

257
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,555
Uh, Charlie, you're not quite
cut from the right cloth.

258
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:41,488
What?
Okay. Make it me.

259
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,389
Mac, you're too low
class. All those women...

260
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,360
are gonna think they're gonna
catch somethin' from you.

261
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,192
They are.
They will.

262
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,232
I was thinking about Dennis.

263
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,995
Right.
Now, Frank...

264
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,367
will any of these women be
attractive in any way? Probably not.

265
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:55,803
Then I'm not going to do
it. Let's sell some drugs.

266
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:56,862
I got it.
Why are you grabbing it?

267
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:57,930
I'm the boss.
Very grabby.

268
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,694
Get out.
Really?

269
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,562
Okay. I think we gotta look for
old ladies with lots of big jewelry.

270
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:09,102
They got the deepest
pockets. Ah, that's my girl.

271
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,230
Dennis, I think you should
unbutton this button too. No...

272
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,605
Show a little chest. Frank, I
know what you're trying to do.

273
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:17,611
And I'm not gonna be a whore.
So just drop it. All right?

274
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,308
Holy shit. Did you guys see that
midget dressed like a lawn jockey?

275
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,873
That's a jockey, Charlie.
Do what, now?

276
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:26,250
That's a real jockey.

277
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,289
The ones that ride on
the horses... Forget it!

278
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:30,187
Really? Wait, wait, wait,
wait. They have horses here?

279
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:31,589
There's a racetrack
next door, dude.

280
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,093
Bye-bye.
What? No!

281
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,288
Where are you going,
man? Where are you going?

282
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,058
All right, whatever!
Let's split up.

283
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,962
I call Dennis. No. I'm not
gonna be a whore, Frank.

284
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,093
You're already a whore. Why
not make some money at it?

285
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,637
You're just gonna try and
make me bang old ladies.

286
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,104
Then you're gonna have
me move on to dudes.

287
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:47,698
I just wanna hang out. We're
wasting time. Dee! Let's split up!

288
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:48,901
Come on!

289
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,514
Oh, that's good, huh?
You like that?

290
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:55,913
It's a real beaut,
ain't she?

291
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:57,679
Holy shit.
You can talk?

292
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,743
What?
That is great.

293
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,756
I would've figured if anything,
your voice would be like super high.

294
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,451
All right.
Well, good for you.

295
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:07,290
She normally doesn't take to
strangers. She must like you, huh?

296
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:09,990
Yeah. Wow. You know, she
seems like a real nice horse.

297
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,555
Well, actually, she kicked the
last stable boy's brains in.

298
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,363
Jesus. He takes his
food through a straw now.

299
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:18,371
I bet. Hey, you wouldn't be
interested in taking his job, would ya?

300
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,373
I'd be very interested.

301
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,705
Well, you have any qualms
about picking up shit?

302
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,870
Terrific. Terrific.

303
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:28,279
Usually, we'd use a shovel for
that. But to each his own, I guess.

304
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,681
Not me. Hey, why don't you
come and meet the fellas?

305
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,481
All right.

306
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:34,419
Oh, right.
Good work.

307
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:41,719
Okay. Now, there's only one thing
that these rich old men understand.

308
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:43,286
And that is money.
Mm-hmm.

309
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:45,958
So I am gonna play the role of
a high-powered executive. Mmm.

310
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,934
And you are going to
be my secretary, Linda.

311
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:51,665
Ooh! No. No. I will be
your business partner.

312
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,639
Dee, these guys
are old school, okay?

313
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,176
They don't like women's rights.
Now, don't give me any lip!

314
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,838
Okay, Linda. The first thing I need
you to do is get Jameson on the phone...

315
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:02,041
and tell him I don't need
his $650,000 investment.

316
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:05,415
He can shove it right back up his
ass. Ooh, I got a better idea, Bob.

317
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,716
How about you do it?
What's that?

318
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,587
Yeah. I think you should get
Jameson on the phone for me.

319
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:14,526
Well, why would I do that, Linda?
You're my secretary and a woman.

320
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:16,587
What do you know about investing?

321
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:20,657
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. Remind me again
what we're having Jameson invest in?

322
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:24,671
Jameson is investing
in new technologies.

323
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,331
Really? Which ones?

324
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,136
Lasers.
Lasers!

325
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,699
Yep.
That is adorable.

326
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,938
Lasers, Linda!

327
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:34,140
Who wants to buy
some drugs?

328
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:42,050
Hey, man.
You workin'?

329
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:44,523
Excuse me? Don't play
dumb with me, hermano.

330
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,423
I know a gigolo
when I see one.

331
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:49,952
No, look, I'm not a gigolo, all right?

332
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,862
For real?
Yeah.

333
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:55,391
Hey, a good-looking guy like you
could do very well in my business.

334
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,938
Thanks. But I'm not really
into banging old ladies.

335
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,804
Bang them?
No, bro.

336
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,901
You got it all wrong, man.
These women are classy.

337
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:07,880
Yeah, they just want someone to be nice
to them. Flirt a little bit. That's it.

338
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,385
Really? I wouldn't have
to bang these ladies? No.

339
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,080
Bro, it's all fancy
dinners, exotic vacations.

340
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:17,056
These ladies have so much
cash, man. It's the life.

341
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,252
You should really
think about it.

342
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,659
You could make
a killing here, bro.

343
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,764
Huh.

344
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,967
Hey.

345
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,834
Nice work.
Hey, thanks, man.

346
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,668
Oh, that's yours.
Thank you very much.

347
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,641
Yours. Thank you.
Hey, man. You said 20.

348
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,008
Take it or leave it.

349
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,876
Hey, whatever, homes.

350
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,450
Puta pendejo.

351
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:58,992
Man, these guys are crazy. I can't
believe they bought all my pills.

352
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:02,628
Ah, you know what they say.
Nobody parties like a jockey!

353
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,433
I was not familiar with
that expression, Buster.

354
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:05,631
I didn't even know
you guys could talk.

355
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,039
So you want that job or not?

356
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:11,545
I tell you what. I got a little something
I gotta straighten out with the mafia.

357
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,705
You know how that goes, right?
Oh, sure.

358
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,841
But when that's done... maybe. Because
there's something about that horse, Buster.

359
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,682
You know, it's like we looked at each
other. And then there was eye contact.

360
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,813
And I was looking at the horse.
The horse was looking at me.

361
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,880
And then it hit me,
I think maybe...

362
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,892
I was a centaur
in my past life.

363
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,555
Well, something tells me you probably
were never half-man, half-horse.

364
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,192
But, hell, what do I know? All I
know is you got a great attitude.

365
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,736
So come on,
you old son of a gun...

366
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,329
and-and let Buster do
a line off your boner.

367
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,113
No?

368
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,080
Uh, "garcon", why don't you
hook up the young lady here...

369
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:56,521
with one of your best
strawberry daiquiris?

370
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:59,321
All righty. Thanks.

371
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:02,829
Hey, how's it going, man? Uh,
did you sell any of your pills?

372
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,762
Uh, no. Actually, I'm kind of working
a different angle here, Charlie.

373
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,663
Dude, check it out. I sold
all of mine. Okay, that's...

374
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,601
Lawn jockeys are crazy people, man.
Did you know that? Great. But, uh...

375
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,663
You're kinda cramping my style. I'm trying to
drum up business here. You know what I'm saying?

376
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:17,006
You know what I'm saying? Dude, I
think I was a centaur in my past life.

377
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:20,275
It totally occurred to me. What makes
you think you were half-man, half-horse?

378
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:22,646
Charlie... Come on.
Out, out.

379
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,014
He's working.
What? I'm enjoying a roll.

380
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,985
He's working. Bro, will
you please get out of here?

381
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,213
You smell like cheese.
No, no.

382
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:28,880
It's horse shit.

383
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,719
Well, whatever it is,
it's terrible. Okay? So...

384
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,350
Let's call it what it
is. It's horse shit.

385
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,690
I have it all over my hands. But
it's not cheese. Let's go. Get up.

386
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:37,390
The horse was eating a lot of cheese.
I don't know what it is. Just you stink.

387
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,126
Come on. Get up. Get
up. I don't wanna get up.

388
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,225
Frank, as a matter of fact, you
really don't smell that much better.

389
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,735
If you could get out, that
would be really helpful.

390
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:45,739
Don't talk to me that way.
Don't talk to me. I am your pimp.

391
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,638
You are my ho.
Look, dude.

392
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,539
Horses don't eat cheese.
Don't...

393
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,134
You are ruining this!
First of all.

394
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:53,680
Will you get out of here, for the
love of all that is holy on earth!

395
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,875
You reek of cheese!
Excuse me.

396
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,645
Are you
the Reynolds party?

397
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:58,878
Yeah.
Uhhuh. Yeah.

398
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:01,217
We had to escort your
friends off the property.

399
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,122
They're waiting for
you by your car. Oh...

400
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:07,958
Yeah. Where?
Ah, the guilty parties.

401
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,293
Yeah. Yeah, Mac made a whole
series of bad decisions.

402
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,298
And then we got kicked out,
and they stole our drugs.

403
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,335
Was he being bossy? Yeah. He was being
very bossy. And now we've got nothing.

404
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:17,530
All right. It's not a total
loss, all right? No, no, no.

405
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,594
Charlie actually...
I sold all my pills.

406
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:20,971
Oh! Nice.
Oh, that's awesome.

407
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,943
What about you, Dennis?
Dennis is a prostitute now.

408
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:26,002
Good.
No, I'm not prostitute, okay?

409
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,048
Yes, he is. There's no
banging old ladies and dudes.

410
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,675
All right? I will be providing a
very important service, however...

411
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,777
as what I would like to be
called a handsome companion.

412
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,652
To dudes?
To guys or...

413
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,350
No, not to dudes.
No, hang on.

414
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:40,292
Hold on. Hang on. To
old, fancy, rich ladies...

415
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:42,795
who want to do classy,
exotic, fancy things with me.

416
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,695
Great. Dennis,
you keep banging dudes.

417
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,859
Dee, let's take Charlie's
money and go buy some cocaine.

418
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,495
It's got higher street value. Do you see what
you're doing here with the bossiness again?

419
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,801
And the demanding? I don't appreciate
it. Ordering everyone around.

420
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:54,307
You're out, dude!
Oh, he's out.

421
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,104
You're not kicking me
out. I'm the boss of you!

422
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,941
You're the only one who hasn't made any
forward progress today. Just hang back.

423
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,914
Wait. I'm just supposed to put my
life into your hands? Look, man.

424
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:03,746
Leave your ego out of
it. We're in some...

425
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,651
Excuse me! We're in some
serious hot water here...

426
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:09,155
because of you and your
bossiness, all right?

427
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,316
I think you should stop
acting like such a baby. Go on.

428
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:16,887
So you're gonna leave me here? We cannot
have you around us screwing things up!

429
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,363
How am I supposed
to get home?

430
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,696
You're supposed to walk like
the rest of the Americans.

431
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,531
You walk, you know?
On their two feet!

432
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,333
Walk?
It's like 40 miles!

433
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,340
Oh, that's why
young people...

434
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:30,468
You can't do this to
me! You can't do this!

435
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:33,104
I'm smart,
and I deserve respect!

436
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,115
I'm gonna get you
sons of bitches!

437
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,715
Whoa!
You want to stop It already?

438
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:46,193
It's all right. I put the parking
brake on. Sorry about that, boys.

439
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,921
Hey, you got our money?
Jesus.

440
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,793
No, I do not have your money. But I think
there's been a misunderstanding here.

441
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,095
And I want to set it straight.
Proceed.

442
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,897
Well, ever since your alleged package...

443
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,530
Came into my bar,
I may or may not...

444
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,506
have had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

445
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,405
You did or you didn't?
I did.

446
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,376
You did have something
to do with it?

447
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,209
No. No. I did have absolutely
nothing to do with it.

448
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:10,148
Wait, wait. You just said you
did have something to do with it.

449
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,412
That's what I heard. I
heard that. I think I said...

450
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,953
I did have absolutely
nothing to do with it.

451
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,852
But you said...
Are you sure?

452
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,619
The thing is when you use a double negative,
it becomes something completely different.

453
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,923
But you know, we can get into that
later. The point is this, guys.

454
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,589
I want to get in
on what you guys got.

455
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,325
I want to dress like
a track star.

456
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:29,301
I want to wear gold shit and slick my
hair back and grow a pompadour, you know?

457
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,861
You want to join our crew,
huh? More than anything.

458
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,238
Okay, first things first.
You gotta prove your loyalty.

459
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,640
Prove my loyalty?
Yeah.

460
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,702
I want you...

461
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,713
to go clean the bathrooms.
Yeah.

462
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,646
The bathrooms?
Yeah. The bathrooms.

463
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,082
Why?

464
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,642
'Cause that's the first step
in becoming a part of our crew!

465
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:49,121
Okay. Guys, I clean a
mean bathroom. Let's see.

466
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,021
I learned from one of
my friends, Charlie.

467
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,219
You'll get to know him too maybe.
I'll bring him in. I'm sure you will.

468
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,558
Okay.
Thank you.

469
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,062
Go.
Thank you.

470
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,065
You gonna really let
him be part of our crew?

471
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,658
Hey, summer squash
for brains...

472
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:03,567
I'm gonna make him
our bitch till Friday.

473
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,400
Oh, bitch boy.
Bitch boy.

474
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:07,839
And after that?

475
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,876
I wanna whack him off
irregardless.
