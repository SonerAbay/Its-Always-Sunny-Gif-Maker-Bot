2
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,540
Frank, pick up!

3
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,141
Pick up, buddy.
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

4
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:47,015
- <i>Hellol</i>
- I got a Code Red here, pal.

5
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:50,147
I got a Code Red. I got tipped off that
the health inspector's coming today.

6
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,781
The guy's gonna be here in 15 minutes.

7
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:53,382
They're pulling a fast one on us!

8
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,087
Okay, I got the place looking
pretty good already...

9
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,494
'cause I was anticipating
something like this, but do me a favor.

10
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,429
Make sure no one is in the bar today, okay?

11
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,865
I cannot have those guys
in here making a mess. You got it?

12
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:08,570
Oh, shit.

13
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,161
What the hell is this?
Why are there chickens everywhere?

14
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,432
No time to explain it to you.
You wouldn't get it anyway.

15
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:41,701
- What are you painting?
- It's a new sign, okay?

16
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,107
A Place for Steaks.

17
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:45,974
What? No, I can't have you put that sign up.

18
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,638
The health inspector's coming,
like, any minute!

19
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:49,204
- So what?
- So what?

20
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,113
We're not Carmine's.
I can't have them see the sign.

21
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,286
Who gives a shit?
We always get a passing grade.

22
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:55,946
Yeah, we get a passing grade...

23
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:58,013
because I bust my ass to
make sure that happens, okay?

24
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,820
And we don't pretend
that we're a restaurant!

25
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,520
- Look, this is...
- crazy! No sign!

26
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,995
No, we're using the sign,
because the sign's a big part of the plan.

27
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,463
What is the plan? What is happening?

28
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,193
Charlie, we found a loophole in the system.

29
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,792
Yeah, it's a closing loophole.
It involves airline miles and points.

30
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,134
You're doing
a chicken-and-airline-miles scam today?

31
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:15,368
It is a great plan. We do not have
a ton of time to explain it to you.

32
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,739
- We're busy...
- Okay, fine, whatever.

33
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,300
- I get it.
- No, you don't.

34
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:20,539
- It's a good plan, Charlie.
- Frank, Jesus Christ, man.

35
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,707
- Where are your shoes?
- I lost 'em in the bathroom.

36
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:25,444
All right, goddamn it. I gotta think here.
Here's what we're gonna do.

37
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,454
We gotta get all these chickens and coops
and feathers and everything in the back office.

38
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,513
- Now! Go!
- Why the hell would we do that?

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,182
I assume you don't want
a health inspector...

40
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,921
seeing anything about a chicken "scam"
you're trying to pull off.

41
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,929
- That's a good point.
- All right, yeah, fine.

42
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:39,693
But don't pretend like you understand
the plan, 'cause that's gonna piss me off.

43
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,326
Okay. Dee, get the joke stool in
the basement, all right? Can't have it out.

44
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,427
What? No way. It's hilarious.

45
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,200
It's not hilarious. It's just a stool
with a nail sticking out of it.

46
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,935
Yeah, when it pokes their butts,
they scream...

47
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,636
'cause they got a nail right in the butt.

48
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,371
You...
You don't understand comedy.

49
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,436
You don't understand comedy.
That's not a joke, it's a lawsuit.

50
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,505
- Just put it in the basement.
- Fine, all right, fine.

51
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,175
- Can't have the guy sitting on that...
- Okay! Relax!

52
00:03:58,251 --> 00:03:59,946
All right, Frank, let's go. Bathroom!

53
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,578
- Come on! I gotta find your shoes!
- All right.

54
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,885
Let's go, let's go. Then help with
the chickens if you can, please.

55
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:05,447
Move, move, move, move.

56
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,891
How could you have possibly
lost your shoes in... Oh, my God.

57
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,929
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

58
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,260
- What's wrong with the toilet?
- Looks clogged.

59
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,892
What the hell? I just had these all in,
like, perfect working condition.

60
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,129
- Must be my shoes.
- Your shoes? What are you talking about?

61
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:20,502
Well, when I said I lost my shoes, I didn't
mean I didn't know where they were.

62
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,064
It's just that they were gone.

63
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:24,474
You flushed your shoes down the toilet?
Why would you do that?

64
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,171
It's an anxiety thing, Charlie.

65
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,908
Everybody's moving so fast all of a sudden,
it freaks me out.

66
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,643
Flushing things gives me control.

67
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,207
- It's a thing.
- That's not a thing.

68
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,412
- It's a thing. - That's not a thing.
I've never heard of that thing.

69
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:35,977
All right, I gotta dig 'em out.

70
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,546
Want me to get a snake tool?

71
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,649
No, I'm just gonna...
Look, go help with the chickens, okay?

72
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:42,820
Help with the chickens, please? Get 'em in
the back office. Do whatever you can.

73
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,420
Charlie, I need you for something.

74
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,055
Goddamn, this thing's broken.

75
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,622
Look, give me that fix bag right there.

76
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,226
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, listen, um...

77
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,964
We've got a huge problem out there, dude.

78
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:53,699
Earlier, when Dennis said...

79
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:56,105
"We've got a really good idea
with this plan"...

80
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,236
that wasn't entirely accurate
'cause it was actually my idea...

81
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,372
and I think the usage of the word "we"
in there is really confusing...

82
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,577
because how can a whole group of people
have the same idea at the same time?

83
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,950
What, do they just say it all at once?
It's ludicrous.

84
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,784
I don't understand why
you're angling for credit right now.

85
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,017
We'll go through the normal
arbitration process at the end of this.

86
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,186
Right. Well, I've just been screwed at
the last three arbitration processes...

87
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,855
and I just want you
to be on my side, you know?

88
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:20,957
- 'Cause I really need you.
- Whatever, dude. I don't care.

89
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,025
Wait. What happened to the glory hole cover?

90
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,970
I took it off. I... I thought you...
you put it on there by accident.

91
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,337
No, I put it up there because I don't want
the health inspector seeing...

92
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,036
that we have a place for a person to get
their dick sucked by a stranger.

93
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:34,672
Dude, you are taking this whole inspection
thing way too seriously, okay?

94
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:37,842
Back to the credit issue... you just don't
know what it's like to be overlooked.

95
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,511
Oh, my God, that's exactly
what's happening to me right now.

96
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:42,578
You know what?
Maybe I'll casually bring it up to him...

97
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:44,283
and then he won't know
what we're talking about.

98
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,382
Ha! I got a fix! I got a fix right here...

99
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,689
All right, we'll just put this up
and boom... that's pretty good.

100
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,730
What was that?

101
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:54,130
- Why did the lights go out?
- Uh, that could be the vacuum sealer.

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,997
That thing probably pulls a lot of power.

103
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,037
- Vacuum sealer? What the hell?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,470
- All right, where's this packaging
machine thing? - Keg room.

105
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,668
Keg room? Okay, good, they're back on.
Frank, Frank, don't go away!

106
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,371
Keep moving chickens, yes, but I need you to
take the "Talk American" sign down.

107
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,539
Are you sure? Maybe he's a racist too.

108
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,412
The health inspector's not a racist, Frank.

109
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:13,714
Take it down, please, okay?
And shoes... shoes, please? Find some shoes.

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,253
- All right, guys. This...
- Oh, shit! This thing's tits!

111
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,848
No, no, no, you can't use this machine,
okay? It blew the surge protector.

112
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,587
We can't do the plan
without the packaging machine.

113
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,492
How else are we supposed
to vacuum-seal the steaks?

114
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:26,532
Steaks? This is a
chicken-and-air-mile-and-steak scam now?

115
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,089
- Yeah.
- All right, fine.

116
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:29,965
I can work with it. I can work with it.

117
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:32,163
Just do me a favor.
Start packaging lemons and limes and things.

118
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,263
- Make it seem like we package shit at the bar.
- Fun.

119
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,934
I need you down in the basement.
I need your reach. Real quick. Come on.

120
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,537
- Okay.
- Hey, Dennis.

121
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,774
Could I talk to you for a second?

122
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,410
Do me a favor. I got a battery here.

123
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,976
Reach up in the carbon monoxide detector...

124
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,681
- Pop it in real quick.
- Yeah, you got it.

125
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:51,587
Hey, Charlie, while we're down here...

126
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,216
I wanted to talk to you about ideas...

127
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,853
and how funny it is that they can come from
all kinds of different places.

128
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:58,762
- - Somebody could say
something funny and might spark an idea...

129
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,629
- Shh, shh. Dee, zip up the mouth.
- No, I know.

130
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,134
- But before the arbitration, I need
you to understand... - Dee, shut up!

131
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,795
That's G-sharp. I got it. I got it, yeah.

132
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,600
Is it broken? It won't shut the hell up.

133
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,937
No, it's doing exactly what
it's supposed to do and that's the problem.

134
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,602
There's a ton of carbon monoxide down here,
so I don't want it doing that.

135
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:12,940
What? Why?

136
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,810
Actually, what I do is I block
the vents to the furnace...

137
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,850
and that fills the basement
with dangerous gases.

138
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,442
Drives the rodents away.
I always do it leading up to an inspection.

139
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,511
- Is that safe?
- No, no. It's incredibly unsafe.

140
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,217
We can't be down here too long.
So get the battery, and we gotta roll.

141
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,986
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, get it out.

142
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,494
- Then just make it look like...
- Goddamn you, Charlie. Goddamn it, go.

143
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,553
- All right, go, go, go. You getting light-headed?
- Yes!

144
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,998
Why'd I hear a squeal? Oh, no, dude.

145
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,832
- Why are you bleeding?
- Dennis scratched me.

146
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:39,804
Mac was doing that thing where he tries...

147
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:42,842
to casually bring something up to me,
like I don't notice.

148
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,275
Come to me like a man.
Talk about being tough all the time.

149
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:46,835
- Can't even look me in the eyes.
- Okay.

150
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:49,404
- How's this for shoes, Charlie?
- Aw, no, Frank. Come on, man!

151
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,177
You're gonna get black paint everywhere!

152
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,843
I've changed my mind about the stool.

153
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,648
No, no stool.
Stool's out. No way!

154
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,450
It's just that it was my idea, Dennis.

155
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,354
It's sort of like
the jean shorts, where you...

156
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:00,619
Look at me when you're talking to me!

157
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:03,457
Oh, shit. I think the steaks are here.

158
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,122
- Oh.
- Nice.

159
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,497
Whoa. That's a big truck.

160
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,265
Oh, shit. No, no, no.
I can't have this truck out here!

161
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,930
Hey, uh, is this Carmine's Steak House?

162
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:17,170
You're looking at the sign, pal.

163
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,303
Oh. Hey, you guys mind
if I get a quick bite here before we begin?

164
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,348
- You want to eat here?
- Uh, yeah.

165
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,939
It's a long drive back to Ohio...

166
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,645
and I figured I was gonna be here a while,
unloading all these steaks.

167
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,052
Well, you won't be here that long, right?
I mean, it's only 400 steaks.

168
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,489
400? You ordered 4,000.

169
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,959
Excuse me, I gotta use the toilet.

170
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,223
- Oh, gosh, you know what?
- Oh, shit.

171
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:39,356
- The thing is, our kitchen's not open...
- Okay, you know what? Yeah.

172
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:43,198
Go ahead, uh, leave the keys in it, maybe
pop the back, we'll help you get started.

173
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,169
I'm gonna fire up the grill and...
all set.

174
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,227
Okay.

175
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:48,399
We got you covered.

176
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,704
- Oh, son of a bitch. Did you flush your shirt?
- Yep.

177
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,905
Okay, I don't want to interrupt here, Charlie,
but we got a major problem on our hands.

178
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,811
We are not a restaurant that serves food.

179
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,680
How are we gonna
package 4,000 steaks?

180
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,151
- We can handle it, okay?
- Dee, we should've never done your stupid plan!

181
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,155
My plan? No way. This was Frank's idea.

182
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,248
Wasn't my idea. Dennis was all over it.

183
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:06,883
Me? No, this was Mac's stupid plan.

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,723
- Then why'd you scratch me?
- 'Cause I was irritated with you.

185
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,660
Look, we can handle all of this, all right?

186
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,528
Excuse me, with all due respect, Charlie,
you don't even know what the goddamn plan is.

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,090
Okay, with all due respect to you...

188
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,658
I think I understand it fully, okay?

189
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,226
You guys used Frank's credit card.

190
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:19,794
You bought a bunch of airline miles.

191
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,034
You used those airline miles
to purchase 400 steaks.

192
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:25,100
Knowing that this delivery company delivered
all variety of animal products...

193
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,169
your plan was to contaminate the steaks
with chicken feathers...

194
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:28,737
by rubbing live chickens all over them.

195
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,010
Then you were gonna repackage the steaks...

196
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,780
at which point, you were gonna return
the contaminated steaks for actual cash...

197
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,879
taking advantage of a loophole in
the current airline miles system, correct?

198
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,390
- Very good, Charlie.
- That is it. That is it.

199
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,051
That was the plan, but I mean...

200
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,618
- We basically had already explained
it to you, so... - Right.

201
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:47,188
But what you didn't plan for was a hungry
delivery guy who'd driven all the way from Ohio.

202
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,758
Or that Dee's oversized fingers could've
accidentally pressed "zero" again...

203
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,360
when she ordered the steaks online...

204
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,029
I'm assuming you did the typing, Dee, yes?

205
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,074
- Goddamn it.
- Dee, you bitch.

206
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,803
But none of this matters to me, okay?
Because today is inspection day.

207
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,345
A day that I pride myself on.
A day that I've never failed on.

208
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:01,903
And I don't plan to begin failing now.

209
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,915
Listen to me and listen close,
like you've never done before.

210
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:08,716
We are going to pull this
thing off, so help me God.

211
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,983
Oh, son of a bitch.

212
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,260
- Okay, here we go.
- Dee, Frank, come with me.

213
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,164
I want you guys to set up a table and chair
in the alleyway, all right?

214
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,895
This guy's gonna be dining
in our "patio area."

215
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,994
Dee, take his order,
make him think it's a real restaurant.

216
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:28,404
Frank, as soon as you're done, haul ass down
the alleyway, move the guy's truck, all right?

217
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,533
All right, I need you guys
to take down that Carmine sign.

218
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,475
I can't have it up
when the inspector gets here.

219
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,035
Get me a steak off the truck, okay?

220
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,775
All right, I'm gonna
show this guy to his table. Here we go.

221
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,749
Oh, hey, right on time!
Here's my guy. You know what?

222
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,082
Don't even bother unloading, 'cause
I'm gonna have my guys handle it, okay?

223
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,416
- You sure?
- Oh, absolutely.

224
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:43,978
- Keys are in the truck, right?
- Yeah...

225
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,718
- Come in. Let's have a bite to eat.
- Okay.

226
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,282
I know you're a hungry guy.

227
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,419
- Oh, it's a nice spot.
- Yeah, it's a nice spot.

228
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,156
We can't complain. We can't complain.

229
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,164
See all these booths over here?
They're nice.

230
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,894
And we got a patio area.
I think you're gonna enjoy sitting there.

231
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,459
You know what? A booth is fine.

232
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,835
No, see, look,
we got these old stools and old booths...

233
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,238
but the patio area is
really something special.

234
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,435
- You know, you're a top-shelf customer, right?
- Well, I...

235
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,445
You want to be having
a top-shelf experience. And here we go.

236
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:08,844
Welcome!

237
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,974
Please, make yourself comfortable.

238
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,713
Yeah, have a seat and, uh, enjoy the patio.

239
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,516
Uh, this is an alley.

240
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,648
I think I'd rather just sit inside.

241
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,717
Spends all day in a truck
and he wants to eat indoors!

242
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,318
Hey, the man needs fresh air!

243
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:26,297
- Dee, take his order, okay?
- Yes, yes. Uh, what can I get you?

244
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,493
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

245
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:34,201
Okay. Here we go.

246
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:36,605
Mac! Steak! Steak! All right, back on this!

247
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:38,803
Dennis, I need you to be
the face in the bar, okay?

248
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,368
I accept that responsibility.

249
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,347
Frank, go, go, go!
Okay, here's my guy. Right on time.

250
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,976
Come on now, buddy. Here we go.

251
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:48,543
Wait. Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's this?

252
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,249
No, no, no, ma'am.
Ma'am, I'm sorry. You can't park here.

253
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,656
- Are you the owner?
- Uh, yeah, Charlie Kelly.

254
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,024
- Who's asking?
- I'm, uh, Sandy Lawler.

255
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:57,687
I'm with the City Board of Health.

256
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,756
I'll be conducting an impromptu
inspection of your bar.

257
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,494
Okay, yeah, uh, what happened to Alan?

258
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,798
Alan was let go on account of his leniency.

259
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,361
- Shall we begin?
- Okay.

260
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,839
Uh, sure. All right, let's get going.

261
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,900
Right in here.
This is our, uh, bartender over here.

262
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,208
- All right, all right, all right.
- Okay.

263
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,578
He's a bit of a character.
Where would you like to begin?

264
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,378
Let's, uh, begin with the bathrooms.

265
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,386
Okay, that's fine. Come on in this way.

266
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,786
I assume all the toilets
are in working order.

267
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,689
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I wouldn't bother
checking if I were you.

268
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,624
I think I will.

269
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:31,128
You're standing awfully close to me.

270
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:33,131
Sorry about that. Yeah.

271
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,826
Do I smell cheese?

272
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,028
I'm gonna leave you to it.
You do your thing, okay?

273
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:39,994
Dennis, heads up.

274
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,200
- What are these?
- They're car keys, okay? Just picked her pocket.

275
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,300
- Go move her car, so Frank can
pull the truck up. - Okay.

276
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,504
Hey, Dee, hold up.
Okay, put this on the furnace, all right?

277
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,945
- Cook it up good.
- Oh, no, he wants a turkey burger.

278
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:51,108
- What? Why?
- I don't know. I offered it to him.

279
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:53,084
- Why would you do that?
- You said pretend we're a restaurant.

280
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,676
He looked like a turkey burger kind of guy.

281
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:57,314
He looked like a turkey burger kind of guy?
Just put it on the furnace.

282
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,017
Cook it up.
Tell him you got the order wrong.

283
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,788
Just tell him you got the thing wrong.
Oh, my God, what a stupid bitch.

284
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,523
What a stupid bitch she is. Okay.

285
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,858
Dude, what's the plan with the chickens?

286
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,427
Okay, everything's
going in the vent, all right?

287
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,097
Chickens, cages,
they're all going in the vent.

288
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,505
But first, count to 30,
and then start moaning into it.

289
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,305
- Why?
- Dude, just do it, okay? Don't ask questions.

290
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:21,141
Just moan in the vent.
After a couple of moans say, "I'm sorry."

291
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,841
- You got it?
- Okay, sure, yeah.

292
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,407
- Twenty-eight, 27... Okay?
- Twenty-six, 25, 24...

293
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,922
Twenty-three, 22, 21, 20...

294
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:35,154
Nineteen, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14...

295
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:38,857
Thirteen, 12, 11, 10, nine...

296
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,332
And how are we looking in here?

297
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,131
- It's acceptable so far.
- Okay.

298
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:46,694
Oh, you hear that?

299
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,330
Oh, I guess there's somebody in there.

300
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,433
It sounds like there's somebody in there,
yeah. Let's take a little peek.

301
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:54,503
Hey, buddy, how about a courtesy cough
or something next time?

302
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,445
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry, you know?

303
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:59,917
Just, uh, give us all a heads-up you're in here,
save us all the embarrassment, you know?

304
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:03,149
Some people, they got, like, no sort of
social boundaries or anything like that.

305
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,712
It's really kind of an awkward thing.

306
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,350
- Did you meet our bartender?
- Hey! All right, all right, all right.

307
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:09,121
That's right. I think
I introduced you to him.

308
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,186
- You want to check out the women's bathroom?
- Yeah.

309
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,323
Women's bathroom, I assure you, is spotless.

310
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,889
Well, we'll see.

311
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,901
No, we actually hardly ever
have women in here, so...

312
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,199
But we're not being graded on that.
All right, in you go.

313
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,433
Go ahead and tinkle.
Move your bowels if you have to.

314
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,498
All right, back office, okay?
Chickens, vents...

315
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,942
- Everything's going in the vents. Go, go, go!
- Okay, okay.

316
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,946
The furnace cooked it way too fast.
It's charred to shit.

317
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,312
- It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter?
I'm gonna give him the wrong order...

318
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:31,873
and just hand him a burned-up steak?

319
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,942
- He's gonna be pissed.
- This guy's not grading our bar.

320
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,319
I don't care if he has the worst dining experience
of his life. Give him the burned steak.

321
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,688
- How's this? - How am I gonna get
all these steaks off the truck?

322
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,920
You don't have to get 'em all.
We're just gonna contaminate a couple.

323
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,552
Then we're gonna
put the chickens onto the truck.

324
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,790
- Why?
- Frank, we're gonna contaminate the truck.

325
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,355
We're gonna contaminate
the whole truck, all right?

326
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,061
That goes to the keg room.
And for the love of God, find a shirt!

327
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:52,536
Find a shirt, Frank! All right. Okay, okay.

328
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,073
Ah, okay. Come on, come on, come on.

329
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,269
Okay. Nice.

330
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,335
- Done.
- Well done! Okay! Up top!

331
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,211
All right, here's the plan: Got to go to
the third stall vents in the bathroom.

332
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:05,648
Chickens are coming out there.
Everything goes to the keg room, right?

333
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:07,709
Start rubbing chickens on steaks.
Seal them up good.

334
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:10,153
Then put everything on the truck...
chickens, steaks, everything on the truck!

335
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,555
- Got it, got it. - We're contaminating
the truck, guys. That's the plan!

336
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,650
- What is this? What are you doing?
- I'm painting a shirt!

337
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,821
No! All right, look. Just, uh, get out of
sight! Or go to the keg room, hide out.

338
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,593
I'm gonna send Dee to you in a minute,
all right? In fact, keep painting.

339
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,635
That's fine. But go to the keg room.
Oh, my God, what an idiot.

340
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:27,901
Hi. Oh, hi, hello.
I'm sorry, is there a-a problem out here?

341
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:29,464
He's making a big stink about the steak.

342
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,339
The steak is burnt to shit.
It's not what I ordered.

343
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,105
Would you look at that?
Man, I'll tell you what.

344
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,976
I'm gonna give you a beer
on the house. Come inside.

345
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,537
- How nice!
- No, I'll just take it here.

346
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:38,140
Actually we don't have
our outdoor liquor license.

347
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,014
I gotta have you drink it inside.
In you go!

348
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,781
This is the worst restaurant
I've ever been to.

349
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,651
So sorry. Terribly sorry, sir.
Terribly sorry.

350
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,384
Aw, Charlie, that's not good!

351
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,688
What are you talking about?
It's great! Thinks we're a real restaurant.

352
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,751
Okay, Dee, table, chairs...
everything's going in the Dumpster.

353
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,297
Then please push it, like, you know, another
couple inches from the door...

354
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:54,731
- It doesn't look like six feet to me.
- What? Of course it does.

355
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,791
No, no, Dee. It looks like five and a half.

356
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,860
You think she's gonna notice six inches?

357
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,530
You move the goddamn Dumpster,
you bitch, okay?

358
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,198
Then haul ass down the alleyway.

359
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,209
Okay. Hi!

360
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:06,973
- Hi! How'd it go in there?
- Uh, fine, I suppose.

361
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,536
Everything checks out.

362
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:09,842
- Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,405
Yeah, lots of customers.

364
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:13,975
We're a bustling business,
so why don't you head to the alleyway...

365
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,681
and see if there's
anything there that needs, uh, inspecting.

366
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:18,189
Ooh, sir... whoa, whoa! Sorry.

367
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,691
- No, no! - I'm gonna need you to
drink that in our VIP lounge area.

368
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,352
- I just want to drink it here.
- Come on!

369
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:25,659
A very important customer like yourself
sitting on a bar with the regulars?

370
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:27,790
I think you're gonna enjoy
the exclusivity of the lounge area.

371
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,357
- So enjoy that.
- It's not a lounge...

372
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:30,925
Hey, all right, all right, all right!

373
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,766
- Why are you doing that to me?
- I don't know.

374
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,362
I don't need you to do that to me.

375
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,930
- I gotta finish...
- Yeah, you gotta finish the job!

376
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,942
- How'd it go with the Dumpster? You move it?
- Huh? Yes.

377
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,672
Okay, here's the plan.
Give this to Frank. Tell him G-sharp.

378
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,441
Then you gotta paint him
head to toe in black.

379
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,506
- Why would I do any of that?
- Dee, just do it, okay?

380
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,380
Just do it, you goddamn bitch.
Oh, you bitch!

381
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:48,818
Stop questioning everything!
Oh, that goddamn bitch.

382
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,719
Oh, that goddamn bitch!

383
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,451
Oh, my God, she's gonna ruin it all.

384
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,426
And how are we out here?

385
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,361
- Everything will be in the report.
- Yeah, sure.

386
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,661
- Mind if I head behind the bar?
- No! Sure!

387
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,031
That's not an issue.
Yeah, come check out the bar.

388
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:06,196
You know, the bar is sort of
the lifeblood of a bar.

389
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,605
I said bar and bar, twice!
And, oh, you know what?

390
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,836
There's drainage pipes down there that
I don't want you to check.

391
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:15,108
"Drainage pipes"? I'm sorry, Mr. Kelly.

392
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,741
- I have to check it out.
- If you gotta do it, you gotta do it.

393
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,512
Now! You know, but...

394
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,021
I mean, I know that they're a little wet,
they get damp and, uh...

395
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,523
Actually, they look pretty good.

396
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:28,458
Oh, all right.
Well, that's great. Uh, so one last thing.

397
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:31,428
I suppose I want to show the blender here,
for our mixing up frozen drinks.

398
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,987
I don't really need to see that.

399
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,033
- Turn it up higher?
- I don't really need to...

400
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:38,730
No, that's not a good idea, but here we go...
See? Yeah, we blew the power.

401
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,829
It's not really environmentally
safe to turn it up that high.

402
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:42,396
That's why we never really do it.

403
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,466
I should dock you for that one.
I'm not gonna.

404
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,408
That's a joke.

405
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,243
I'd love to show you our packaging machine
I keep in the keg room.

406
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:50,873
Here, come take a peek here.

407
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,976
Look at all this. Look at all of this!

408
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,350
Oh, my!

409
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:57,218
- This is...
- A bit excessive? Yes, I know.

410
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,621
But I'm a little anal
when it comes to securing the perishables.

411
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,559
I just don't want anything to get rotten,
and that's about as good as it gets.

412
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:04,619
You're not the only one
with standards around here.

413
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,165
So come on down to the basement.
You can check this out.

414
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,463
Okay, so, uh, watch your step
on the stairs here.

415
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,402
Wouldn't want you to trip on
any old paint cans or anything like that...

416
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,371
but hopefully everything
down here, you know...

417
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,931
has been properly painted
and put where it's supposed to be.

418
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,239
- So you know what I'm saying?
- No, I don't.

419
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:21,939
- Where's the carbon monoxide detector?
- Carbon monoxide detector!

420
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:24,847
All right, so you reach up there and you
give that a poke and everything should...

421
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:30,478
- Excellent.
- All right, that was excellent.

422
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:34,014
- Uh, I'm feeling a little light-headed.
- Yeah, it could be the stairs.

423
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,027
Or, you know, maybe you're just
dizzy by the cleanliness.

424
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,427
- Let's get you out of here. No
sense in lingering around. - What?

425
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,864
You checked the carbon monoxide
and that's all you gotta do there.

426
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:44,596
Okay, let's see.
Uh, I think we covered everything.

427
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,764
- I mean, uh, doorknob? That works.
- Yeah.

428
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,774
Showed you all the packaged produce.

429
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:52,606
- Hey, did you meet our bartender?
- All right, all right.

430
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,270
We're not paying for contaminated steaks.

431
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,314
Your entire truck is filled with chickens.

432
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,077
You want me to return 4,000 steaks?

433
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,640
This restaurant is insane.

434
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:02,312
- "Restaurant"? - Yeah, if you
count a bowl of peanuts, you know?

435
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,515
We get the drunks in here,
they get all ornery and confused.

436
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,319
What are you gonna do?
It comes with the territory.

437
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:09,327
- I'd love to spend a little bit more time in here...
- Ah, that's about it, Mr. Kelly.

438
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,885
- That's it?
- Yeah.

439
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:12,521
- Oh...
- Hey!

440
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,262
Yes? Are you talking to me?

441
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:19,265
Yeah.

442
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,700
What is it?

443
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,839
All right, all right, all right.

444
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:31,047
Yes. Okay.

445
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:33,414
You know, all right, all right, all right...
kind of says it all.

446
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:34,976
So, here we go.

447
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,614
Uh, last thing, Sandy.
Is this concrete regulation?

448
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,659
- You know, I know there's some cracks and...
- It looks fine.

449
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:44,093
But I'll tell you what's not fine, Mr. Kelly,
and that's the Dumpster.

450
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,757
The regulation is exactly six feet...

451
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:48,629
and you were at five and a half.

452
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,191
Oh, that goddamn bitch.

453
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,966
I know Alan would let this slide,
but I'm not Alan.

454
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,563
I'll have to dock you for that.

455
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,165
Okay, well, I understand.

456
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,768
I assure you that those responsible,
they'll be dealt with.

457
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:03,212
However, you do have
an amazingly clean bar...

458
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:07,514
and therefore I'm giving
Paddy's Pub the highest possible grade.

459
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,451
- You are?
- Congratulations.

460
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,616
Oh, my... You got me
with the whole Dumpster thing!

461
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,353
- Oh, man, that's really, really exciting stuff!
- Oh, well...

462
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,418
- It's just really fantastic.
- That was nice.

463
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,987
- Have a wonderful day.
- Okay.

464
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,531
Okay.

465
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:28,432
Guys, we got the highest grade!

466
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:31,601
I didn't think we were gonna do it 'cause of
the Dumpster, but she got us the highest grade!

467
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,338
- The highest grade of...
- The health inspection!

468
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,902
We passed the health inspection!

469
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,709
Boo!

470
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,410
Oh, yeah, we don't...
we don't give a shit about that.

471
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,214
Yeah, we were excited
about the airline miles thing.

472
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:43,517
Yeah, that's cool too, but the health
inspection was the whole thing!

473
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:46,387
I pulled it off! It was like, "It goes here,
goes there!" I did the whole thing.

474
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,948
Charlie, come on. We always pass, okay?

475
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,688
We never have a hard time passing.

476
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,423
It's not a big deal. Nobody gives a shit.

477
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:54,295
You didn't do anything that special.

478
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,099
That's how you make
a joke stool right there!

479
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,432
Ow, Charlie!

480
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:01,598
- Did you do that?
- Yeah, you know what? I think I did.

481
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,335
You did it? Oh, that's so funny!

482
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,967
- Are you kidding me?
- I thought I saw you!

483
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,534
Are you kidding? Unbelievable.

484
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,500
