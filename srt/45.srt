1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:06,390
<i>Come one,
Come all to a beautiful show</i>

2
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:10,055
It's gonna be awesome and...
Some other stuff

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,755
Some other musical stuff.

4
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:18,793
- What you doing, buddy?
- I wrote a musical.

5
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:21,657
- You wrote a musical?
- Why, why did you do that?

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,927
Just to write a musical. Does there
have to be a reason? I don't think so.

7
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:28,990
Yeah, there does. Nobody writes a musical
for no reason. That doesn't make sense.

8
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:31,488
All right, this guy did,
so there you go.

9
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:33,130
Who's the mark?

10
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,217
- What?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,051
No, there's no... there's no
mark, guys.

12
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:39,356
I wrote a musical.
It's pretty damn good, okay?

13
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,129
- I want to put it on.
- Right. What's your angle?

14
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,255
- I don't have an angle.
- Whose face are we shoving this musical in?

15
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:44,685
You don't shove a musical in
someone's face.

16
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,456
- What are you talking about?
- But who versus?

17
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:48,032
Who are we doing it versus?

18
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:49,621
Oh, my God, are you guys
going to make this about this?

19
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:53,011
Look, I just wrote a musical to
write a musical, okay?

20
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:55,006
I don't have a ulterior
motive here.

21
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,095
I'm not trying to screw anyone
or gain anything out of it.

22
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,652
You know what, if you guys
don't want to be in it,

23
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:01,652
I can find other people
to play your parts.

24
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:03,136
Hang on there, pal.

25
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:05,253
Hang on. Hang on. We're just trying
to wrap our heads around this.

26
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,794
Yeah, there's no reason to
give away our parts, okay?

27
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:10,645
- All right.
- No, we'll do it. What's it called?

28
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,587
The Nightman Cometh.

29
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:18,947
Synchro by Criztian and Sososeries
The Bitches Team

30
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,444
Okay, gather around.

31
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,385
{\pos(192,125)}Please, everybody.
Let's gather down front.

32
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:53,744
{\pos(192,200)}I feel the magic
Do you feel the magic?

33
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:54,923
Here we go!

34
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:57,135
Now, you guys, you all know
Artemis.

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,151
Artemis was kind enough to book
for us this fine local theater.

36
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:03,903
- So round of applause for Artemis.
- Very nice.

37
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:08,257
She also transcribed my work into a format
you might consider a little bit more legible.

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,867
Or literate.
She added words to it.

39
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:10,965
Yeah, right.

40
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,561
No more interruptions now, Dee.
Thank you, please.

41
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,206
Okay, well, Charlie, I got a question
for you. Who's playing this lead boy?

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,400
- That's going to be Mac.
- What?

43
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,856
- Oh, yeah! Lead, of course.
- Wait, who's playing the dayman?

44
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,335
Well, the lead boy becomes the
dayman when he defeats the nightman.

45
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:26,506
- So it's also Mac.
- Two parts? Oh, yeah!

46
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:28,604
- Wait, that's bullshit, bro.
- The nightman's a better role.

47
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,003
He gets to play two roles?
I mean, come on.

48
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,667
- It's the same person...
- Charlie, who's playing the troll guy?

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,997
- You're going to play the troll guy.
- I'm the troll guy?

50
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,400
- Who else would be the troll?
- Oh, I like that.

51
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,337
- All right, good.
- Can I do it naked?

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,275
Absolutely not.
Why would you want to be naked?

53
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:44,535
Because in the '70s,
everybody did theater naked.

54
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,106
Everybody got laid all the time.

55
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:49,101
All right, well, this is not the '70s. You're
going to do theater with your clothes on, please.

56
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:50,625
Charlie, what the hell is
this play about?

57
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,766
- I'm a princess who lives in a coffee shop?
- You work in a coffee shop.

58
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,923
You don't live in a coffee shop.
Read closer.

59
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,093
Well, why am I in love with a
little boy?

60
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,985
- You're in love with a young man.
- You wrote "boy".

61
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,722
Well, all right, man, boy,
it's a metaphor.

62
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,614
Well, the audience is going
to think I'm a child molester.

63
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,011
I've changed my mind.
I'm playing the nightman.

64
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,009
- Oh, yeah.
- Why would you want to play the nightman?

65
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,634
The nightman's bad-ass, dude.
He has the eyes of a cat

66
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:15,050
- and does karate across the stage.
- Where are you getting that from?!

67
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:16,774
- Karate?!
- No, I made that up, man.

68
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,166
This is great. That frees up the
lead boy role and the dayman role.

69
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,105
- I can play both those.
- No, I don't want you guys switching roles.

70
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,412
- That's not how it works.
- Hey, Frank you got a guy that does cat eyes?

71
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,007
- I'm already on it.
- All right, God, for the love of God.

72
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,789
You know what?
Let's just get started.

73
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,589
<i>- Okay, you guys ready?
- Yeah.</i>

74
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:37,055
<i>Tiny boy, little boy,
Baby boy, I need you</i>

75
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:41,639
<i>Tiny boy, little boy,
Want to make love to you, boy</i>

76
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,312
Okay, hold on a second.

77
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:44,973
- Charlie?
- Yes.

78
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:46,830
- Are you goddamn kidding me?
- What?

79
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:48,904
"Tiny boy, little boy,
baby boy"?

80
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,615
Yes.

81
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,527
You're wanting me to say that I want to
make love to a little, baby, tiny boy.

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,072
But I have explained this to
you, Dee.

83
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,910
I'm talking about the spirit of
this man-- is like a little boy.

84
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,529
- It's a metaphor.
- You keep using that word,

85
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:00,956
but I'm not convinced
you know what it means.

86
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,033
And also, I'm not making out
with Dennis later.

87
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,796
'Cause it says we're supposed to
do that at the end of the song,

88
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,124
- and that's not going to happen.
- I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that either, bro.

89
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,208
Well, this is why I didn't think
you should be playing the boy, okay?

90
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:10,583
I don't want you guys kissing either.

91
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:13,377
What if it's just a sexually
charged embrace?

92
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,919
Okay, Artemis, please don't
talk to the talent.

93
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:17,629
You know what? Um...

94
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,819
All right, screw this shit. If no one
likes the song, I'm going to cut the song.

95
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,146
- Thank you.
- Whoa, no, no, no, no, don't cut the song, man.

96
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,191
I like the song.
Dee, apologize to Charlie.

97
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,112
I'm not going to do that.
He wants me to bang this baby,

98
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,157
- and I don't feel comfortable.
- I think it's a bad idea to cut the song.

99
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,246
Thank you, Artemis.
Thank you very much.

100
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,506
All right, could you give me a
second with... with the talent here?

101
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,678
Thank you. Uh, Dennis,
could you take a five?

102
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,027
Uh, well, I just want the
song, man.

103
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,011
- I would like for you to take a five.
- Five... five minutes?

104
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:46,233
Can we have five now please?
Can you have a five over there?

105
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,965
Will you take a five, Dennis?!
Take a five, please!

106
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,091
Okay, Dee, the song is history.

107
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,786
Thank you, Charlie. I appreciate that.
'Cause I was uncomfortable.

108
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,772
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- What are we going to sing instead?

109
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:01,167
- What should I sing?
- Uh, what's on the back there?

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,879
- It's the same song.
- And what's on the very back page?

111
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:06,627
- Nothing.
- Then that's what you'll be singing.

112
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,548
- Charlie, this is my big song.
- Yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,971
Everybody else has a big song.
I deserve to have one.

114
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,967
- Do you? Don't screw you?!
- Don't screw me like this, Charlie. Come on!

115
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,691
Oh, I'm sorry, Dee.

116
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,252
Um, let me try and rember
something.

117
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:23,865
Uh, let's see... was it... did Dee write
a musical and come to Charlie with it?

118
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:27,507
No, Charlie wrote a musical and
came to Dee with it.

119
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,122
And the gang. And the gang likes to
screw it up and make it about themselves

120
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:34,300
and take it away from Charlie
and ruin his hopes and dreams.

121
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:37,243
So let me tell you something, Dee;
let me break down a scenario for you.

122
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:40,424
I could cut the song, okay,
because I wrote it.

123
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:44,090
I could have Artemis do the song,
okay, because you did not write it.

124
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:47,288
Or I could strap on a wig and
I could do the song myself.

125
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:51,739
So you tell me, little Miss All That,
what do you want to do--

126
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,265
song or no song?

127
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,791
Song.

128
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,798
Song?

129
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:05,277
- Yeah, song.
- You want to sing a song.

130
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,442
- I never wasn't going to sing the song.
- You were excited about singing a song,

131
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,336
- and you want to sing a song?
- Yeah, I would like to do it.

132
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,227
Good!

133
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,752
So back up on your podium you go.

134
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:17,786
Thank you.
Dennis, what are you doing?

135
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:20,198
I'm eating because I'm very
uncomfortable.

136
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:23,403
Well, you guys are making...
Can you just get on the stage please,

137
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,811
and can we finish this rehearsal?

138
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:26,708
- It was really loud and...
- Don't start!

139
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,122
That wasn't five minutes.

140
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,375
Okay, you know what, you guys
have me up to here.

141
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,759
Okay, I'm here.
I don't want to be here, okay?

142
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:36,294
Now I have to play the piano and
I'm all up here.

143
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:38,890
So let's... you know what,
let's try and get this down.

144
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,353
Let's try and work this down
a bit, okay?

145
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,310
And you know what's going to do that,
learning the song, the way it's written.

146
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,380
Let's do it.

147
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:48,488
Back to the top.
Five, six, seven, eight...

148
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:54,593
<i>Got to play the troll toll
To get into this boy's hole</i>

149
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,514
<i>You've got to pay the troll toll
To get in</i>

150
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:01,537
<i>You want this baby boy's hole,
You've got to pay the troll toll</i>

151
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,826
Stop, stop, stop.
All right, not bad.

152
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,530
Good rhythm, love the
enthusiasm.

153
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:09,947
I feel like you're saying "boy's hole",
and it's clearly "soul".

154
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,877
And I know, Artemis, you did
write "soul", right?

155
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,896
- I did write "soul".
- So it's "boy's soul".

156
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,488
<i>You got to pay the troll toll
to get in this boy's hole...</i>

157
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,752
No, see, right there.
It sounds like "hole".

158
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,041
Like if you drag that out...
Are you chewing gum?

159
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,680
- Yeah.
- Give me the gum, okay?

160
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:27,030
- Give me the gum, Frank, please?
- He said, "No gum".

161
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,079
- I said, "No gum," everyone.
- It's unprofessional.

162
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,916
- Okay. Thank you.
- Charlie, can I bring something up?

163
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,241
- Yes.
- I think we have to be very careful

164
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,288
- about how we do the rape scene.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,122
What in God's name are you talking?
There's no rape scene.

166
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:41,932
Well, sure, I pay the troll toll,
and then I rape Dennis.

167
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,001
No, you don't rape him.
You become him.

168
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,946
- You do not rape him.
- He doesn't?

169
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,724
No! Look, let me just walk
you guys through this, okay?

170
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,070
Here's what happens.
Once you pay the toll,

171
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:54,685
I want you to come over to Dennis over
by his bed here, okay?

172
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,724
- I'll be lying back.
- You want me to cross the stage?

173
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,342
- Yes.
- All right, this is a great opportunity

174
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,851
to showcase some skills, and,
like, just put on a clinic.

175
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:04,299
- I would rather you didn't.
- Well, I think the people are gonna want to see that.

176
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:06,930
And then I'll hop up sort of
like a cat, like so.

177
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:08,688
Jesus Christ, just leave it at that.

178
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:11,834
Okay, once he gets near you,
you have to sense him, okay?

179
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,930
Suddenly, you sense him.

180
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,522
What if I were to position
him in a way where I get behind him,

181
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:17,891
and then Frank could throw
that blanket that he's got right there

182
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,503
over us, and then that way
you can't see the penetration.

183
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,734
That's a good idea.
You know what, Charlie?

184
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:24,368
Because the blanket will make
the rapings... I'm sorry,

185
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:27,771
- the sexing from behind feel more classy.
- That's good.

186
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,518
And what I can do is thrust this
way, and you can struggle.

187
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:35,606
Now I'm here, okay? I am, I'm past
where I thought I could go.

188
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,739
I'm, like, all the way up here with it.

189
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,113
- Oh, my-- Hey, you!
- Oh, my God! You scared me!

190
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,718
I'm sorry. I dropped, like,
a hundred-dollar bill under there.

191
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,433
I can't find it anywhere, and then...
What are you doing walking here?

192
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,388
- Is this one of your walking places?
- Charlie, I have Mace.

193
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,618
Oh, my God, check this out.

194
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:58,434
I have a free ticket for you
to see a musical that I wrote.

195
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:01,443
Oh, wow, a free ticket to a
play that I don't want to see.

196
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,510
- You don't want to see it?
- I don't want to.

197
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,916
- It's a front row seat.
- I don't care. I don't want to see your play.

198
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,014
I'm gonna cut you a bargain, okay?
I'm gonna cut you a little deal.

199
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,989
You come and see this play-- I
didn't want to have to do this--

200
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,605
- but if you come and see this play...
- Yeah?

201
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,195
...I'm gonna leave you alone
for the rest of your life.

202
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

203
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:16,408
Okay, so you're not gonna
follow me home anymore

204
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:20,345
and you're not gonna call me at 3:00
in the morning and tell me that

205
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,764
you are in the emergency room in the hospital
because you had a terrible car accident?

206
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:27,419
- Yeah, well, it's great that you came.
- Well, you listed me as your emergency contact.

207
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:30,200
- Well, yeah, because I consider you that.
- I have to go!

208
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,901
All right, I swear to God I'm
gonna leave you alone.

209
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,661
I'm gonna stop listing you as my emergency
contact. I'm gonna stop calling you.

210
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:40,586
All that stuff if you see the musical.
That's how much this means to me.

211
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,314
Nice.

212
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:46,829
- Leave me alone.
- You're not gonna regret it.

213
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,271
I regret it already.

214
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,953
All right.

215
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:01,638
Charlie, what is going on, dude?

216
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,579
- When are we gonna start?
- We're gonna start we're ready to start.

217
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:04,313
Stop hounding me.

218
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,563
We were supposed
to start 20 minutes ago.

219
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,846
We're not gonna start...

220
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,600
She's here! She's here!
She's here! She's here!

221
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,104
Circle in, everybody.

222
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,806
Can we get down in the middle?
Can we get down front?

223
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,239
A couple last-minute things.

224
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,472
I just want to brief
everyone on this.

225
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:15,914
Artemus, can you bring in Gladys?

226
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:16,654
This is Gladys.

227
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:18,408
She's going to be playing
the piano instead of me tonight.

228
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,305
- What? Why?
- It's cool. She knows all the songs.

229
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:21,961
Gladys, can you head
out there and get us started?

230
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:25,457
I forgot to tell you, Calvin Coolidge
was a good friend of mine.

231
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,169
You've been telling me that
Calvin Coolidge was a friend of yours,

232
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,120
like, all morning.

233
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,554
- And at a certain point...
- How many times?

234
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,607
Like, a hundred times now.

235
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,530
At a certain point, I need you to stop
telling the Calvin Coolidge story

236
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:34,609
and start playing the piano.

237
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,561
Don't shush me, okay?
Now please don't shush me.

238
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:37,697
We have to start.

239
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,846
Just get her out there and
get the play started!

240
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:40,868
What the hell you doing?

241
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,298
You can't be throwing us
curveballs like this.

242
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:43,790
Don't argue with me
right now, okay?

243
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,469
We just gotta do this.
Let's stick together.

244
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,594
Real quickly, okay?
Just a couple of things.

245
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,447
I can't really move my arms in this
thing, so I think I need to rip the pits.

246
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,909
Do not rip that costume, okay?

247
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:52,719
It's very expensive.

248
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,046
All right, fine,
but one other thing.

249
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,413
I wrote a song.
I'm gonna throw it in.

250
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,961
I swear to God,
you cannot add a song.

251
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,006
It's gonna happen.

252
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,012
I will smack your face off
of your face.

253
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,315
Do not add a song.

254
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,765
It started. It started.

255
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,925
You gotta get out there.

256
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,285
Just get out there.

257
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,462
<i>What is this strange feeling?</i>

258
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,473
<i>I feel so strange inside.</i>

259
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,679
<i>It's so strange, but appealing.</i>

260
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:29,500
<i>I feel good, oh!</i>

261
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:32,729
<i>Tiny boy, little boy,
baby boy, I need you.</i>

262
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,014
<i>Tiny boy, little boy,
I want to touch you.</i>

263
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,787
<i>If you only knew</i>

264
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,853
<i>- What I'd do to you.
- Boy, I need you, boy.</i>

265
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:42,225
<i>If I was that boy,
that's inside of you.</i>

266
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,243
<i>Tiny boy, little boy,
Baby boy, I need you</i>

267
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:48,526
<i>Tiny boy, little boy,
I want to make love to you.</i>

268
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:51,579
<i>If you only knew,
what I'd do to you.</i>

269
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:54,547
<i>If I was that boy,
that's inside of you.</i>

270
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,966
<i>Inside, inside, inside of you..</i>

271
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,022
<i>My boy...</i>

272
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:05,068
Oh, boy.

273
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,979
<i>Just to be clear,
I did not write that song,</i>

274
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,903
<i>And have never had sex
with a child...</i>

275
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,369
<i>Just to be clear.</i>

276
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,340
What? What is happening?

277
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:28,991
<i>Most men find me to be
an eight or nine out of ten.</i>

278
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:33,676
<i>And I am available
to any interested men.</i>

279
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,882
<i>Who'd like to get my number
after the show.</i>

280
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,960
Keep singing, bitch!

281
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:41,343
You're not gonna have a face
by the time I'm done with you!

282
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:43,074
What the hell is she doing?

283
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,570
She's bombing like crazy.

284
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:45,473
What an idiot.

285
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,754
I was awesome, though, right?

286
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,879
You? No, dude, you totally
froze up out there.

287
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:49,624
You sucked.

288
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:51,474
I was hearing a lot of
laughs out there, bro.

289
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:52,895
Laughs are cheap.

290
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,269
I'm going for gasps.

291
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,646
Wait till you see, dude.

292
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,058
Gasps are where it's at.

293
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:59,216
Gotta go pop my cat eyes in.

294
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:13,781
That's good.

295
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,319
That is not good.
This is not a comedy, okay?

296
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:16,869
No one's supposed to be laughing.

297
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,339
You came at the right time.

298
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:21,983
Is he sleeping?

299
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:26,537
Yes, he's sleeping right over there,
just the way you like 'em.

300
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,999
Did you bring the toll?

301
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,252
Confound your lousy toll, troll.

302
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,884
God damn it.

303
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,234
Stop laughing at me.

304
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:43,572
<i>You gotta pay the troll toll, if
you want to get into that boy's hole.</i>

305
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,964
<i>You gotta pay the troll toll
to get in...</i>

306
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:49,028
<i>You want the baby boy's hole,</i>

307
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:53,297
<i>You gotta pay the troll toll,
You gotta pay the troll toll to get in.</i>

308
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:55,798
<i>Troll toll</i>

309
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,641
<i>What you say?</i>

310
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,449
<i>Troll toll!</i>

311
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:03,012
<i>Troll toll!</i>

312
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:08,546
Here's your toll, troll.

313
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,226
Your boy awaits.

314
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,925
At last, the boy's soul is mine.

315
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,197
Give me that leg, boy.

316
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,196
Dude, do you have
a boner right now?

317
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,001
Shut up, dude,
don't ruin this for me.

318
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,815
What?
Oh, Jesus.

319
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:41,198
That's enough.

320
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:56,250
I could smack everyone
into tiny, little pieces.

321
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,692
Hello, boy.

322
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:06,238
Come over here and scratch
my itchy-witchy toesy-woesies.

323
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:08,668
What?

324
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,668
Get over here.

325
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,935
- No, Antonio.
- I control you.

326
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:13,502
You control nothing.

327
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,995
I am not your slave anymore,
and I'm not a boy.

328
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,202
I am a man, see?

329
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,136
I was transformed...

330
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:27,342
by the strong... musky
power of true love.

331
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,532
I am now...

332
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,182
The Dayman.

333
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:38,122
What the hell is that?

334
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,571
You know what it is, bitch.

335
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,912
Where's the boy?

336
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:57,497
The boy is gone.

337
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,827
You can't tell me what to do.

338
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,425
I didn't tell you what to do.
You're skipping a line, dude.

339
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:08,246
- You can't tell me what to do...
- You're still skipping the same line.

340
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:08,730
Just move past it.

341
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,096
God, it's crazy how much better
I am at acting than you are.

342
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,557
I'm going to kick your ass, bro.

343
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,623
I'll tell you what...

344
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,643
I am the ruler of darkness.

345
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,411
I am the master of light.

346
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,167
I am... the Dayman.

347
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:24,735
Whatever, bro.

348
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,469
- Here's whatever, bitch.
- What? No, don't improv.

349
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,402
Don't tell me what to do.

350
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,745
Body bag.

351
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,862
You have defeated
the evil that was here.

352
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,452
Naturally.

353
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,109
For I am the Dayman.

354
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,155
You once were a boy
and now you're man.

355
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,800
And I am in love with you.

356
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:21,816
That's right.

357
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:24,584
And now I am in love with you.

358
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,667

Stage freeze.

375

Don't say "stage freeze."
Just do it.

376
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,555
<i>I was that little boy.

to ask for your hand,</i>

381

<i>So if you want to marry, man,</i>

382
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,766
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,750
<i>Will you come on stage
and join me.</i>

<i>In this thing called matrimony?</i>

<i>Please say yes and
do not bone me, please.</i>

386
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:02,580
<i>Just marry me.</i>

387
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:12,650
Is that it?

388
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,837
Is the play over?

389
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:19,251
Okay, great.
Well, then I'm out of here.

390
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,785
Hang on, hang on,
hang on a second, hang on.

391
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,192
- Is it a yes, or...?
- Is it a yes?

392
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,242
Really, Charlie,
will I marry you?

393
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:28,692
No, no, I will not.

394
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,058
I will never marry you.

395
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:33,120
And I also held up my end of the bargain,
so I never have to see you again.

396
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,584
Okay, so wait.

397
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,001
I'm sorry,
I want to get this clear.

398
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:38,459
You are saying no?

399
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,721
Oh, I am definitely,
definitely saying no.

400
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,017
Well, I didn't ever
sign anything, so...

401
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:47,442
I'll see you tomorrow?

402
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:53,960
That's it. You can go home.

403
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,677
It's over.

404
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,102
- We've got to bow.
- Hold on.

405
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,467
If you want.

406
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:03,629
This was a great musical.
You did a great job.

407
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:13,947
Told you nobody just writes
a musical for no reason.

408
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,913
I am here.

409
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,579
I am passed here.

410
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:19,032
And by the way,

411
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,646
I thought the rape scene
went really well.

412
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:22,646
I am here.

413
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:23,696
I am here with it.

414
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,096
And that was awful for me.

415
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:27,779
And if you bring this up back
at the apartment tonight,

416
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,769
I'm going to smack you,
I swear to God.
