1
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:07,229
Something outside the box.

2
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:08,263
Come on, people.

3
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:09,499
You agree with me.

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,309
The shareholders meeting is next week.

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,306
If we don't act fast, this company will
be stripped down and sold for scrap.

6
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,185
I say we cut a deal
with the Wheeler Group.

7
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:18,988
You want to make a deal with the
people who are threatening to gut us?

8
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,156
What choice do we have?

9
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:21,290
No.

10
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:25,928
There is one man who
can save this company.

11
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:26,962
Its founder.

12
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,933
The man is from a different era.

13
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,203
He's a Neanderthal, an animal.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,539
Yeah, and just the animal we need.

15
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:41,476
Bring in... the warthog.

16
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:48,684
Hey, Frank, how do you
know that these are crow's eggs?

17
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,052
Because I saw a crow.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,053
Hurry up.

19
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,188
I can't stay here much longer.

20
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:54,323
Oh, my God, there's a whole
untapped world of bird eggs that

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,491
we're not even taking advantage of.

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,693
Get the phone!

23
00:00:58,762 --> 00:00:59,862
Hello?

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,131
Is this the warthog?

25
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,069
I ain't heard that name in a long time.

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:29,022
Sync & corrections by

27
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:38,370
Five, four, three, two, one!

28
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:40,353
Oh, boom, 24 hours is up.

29
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:41,354
The found wallet is ours.

30
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:44,057
Let's pop this bad boy
open and see what we've won.

31
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,995
Mr. Brian LeFeve from Quebec, you lose.

32
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,564
Boom, I got your wallet.

33
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,032
Boom, I got your credit cards.

34
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,166
Boom, I got your money.

35
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,134
Oh, shit.

36
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,101
Is that Canadian?

37
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:56,069
Ah, throw it in the trash.

38
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,838
I'm not gonna throw it in the trash.

39
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:58,805
Might be worth more than ours.

40
00:01:58,873 --> 00:01:59,773
We'll exchange it.

41
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,574
What's this?

42
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:01,474
Phillies ticket.

43
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:02,108
For today!

44
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:04,711
Oh, shit, looks like we're
going to the Phillies game.

45
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,913
Always check your breath.

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,080
Right.

47
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:11,284
And when you shake their hands,
make sure your hands are bone dry.

48
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:12,252
Dry hands.

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,219
Never wet and clammy.

50
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,187
I got it.

51
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:15,155
Guys, quick announcement.

52
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:18,124
I'm gonna be popping these crow's eggs
in the fridge here so they don't spoil.

53
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:19,125
Do not touch them.

54
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:20,093
They are ours.

55
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,061
We won't.

56
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,663
Guys, why are you dressed like that?

57
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,765
There's some scumbag company
that's trying to take over the

58
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:27,400
business that I founded, and
I'm not gonna stand for that.

59
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:29,369
Yeah, no, we're not gonna stand for that.

60
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,438
Frank's taking me under his wing;
he's gonna teach me how to

61
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:32,405
swim with the sharks.

62
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:33,506
Charlie can't read.

63
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,575
He'll adapt.

64
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:35,943
He'll adapt to reading?

65
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,111
Okay, you know what, we
don't need them, all right?

66
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,346
We have plenty of fun
things to do today, okay?

67
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,282
That's right, while you guys
are crunching numbers, we're

68
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,718
gonna be soaking up some sun at
the Phillies game, courtesy of

69
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:45,819
one Mr. Brian LeFeve.

70
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,187
Who the hell is that?

71
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,456
The guy whose wallet we found at the bar.

72
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:51,725
What are you gonna do if
he comes looking for it?

73
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,193
Uh, tell him to suck a boner.

74
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,394
Exactly.

75
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:55,896
Boom, I got your wallet.

76
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:58,131
Boom, I got your credit cards.

77
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,768
Boom, I got your Phillies tickets.

78
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:05,872
Yeah, I've never been in... Whoa.

79
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,840
Oh, shit.

80
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,174
Oh, my God.

81
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,509
Awesome.

82
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:11,912
Oh, fine dining and baseball food.

83
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,879
There's more.

84
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:14,180
Hey! Oh!

85
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:15,749
Free batteries!

86
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,017
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

87
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:18,184
Calm down, calm down.

88
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,385
What's in here?

89
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:20,520
Free shit, free shit.

90
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:21,488
Guys, calm down.

91
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:22,555
Look at all these coasters.

92
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,390
Jesus Christ.

93
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,692
Act like you belong here.

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,793
Now listen to me.

95
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,096
The fact that we're in a box
leads me to believe that there

96
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:31,098
are definitely gonna be other
people coming here today,

97
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,233
and they're probably gonna be
friends with this LeFeve guy.

98
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,836
So we need to talk about
an exit strategy.

99
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,104
We don't want to get caught.

100
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,138
Okay, exit strategy.

101
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:39,372
All right, I'll run the op.

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,541
This the only entrance and/or
exit, therefore if somebody

103
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,544
comes in, I will spring off
the balcony to safety.

104
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:45,612
No, no, no, no.

105
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,579
That's a 50-foot drop.

106
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:49,482
Yes, of course, and I'm a professional,
so I will tuck and roll.

107
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,417
Oh, you're gonna tuck and
roll through a 50-foot drop?

108
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,921
Dennis, if I had a gun with me, I'd be
spraying bullets into the air as I fell.

109
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,991
No, no, no, we don't have time for
these types of scenarios, okay?

110
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:01,427
I'm talking about coming up with a
real plan, a real exit strategy.

111
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:05,065
If we get caught, we could get in a lot of...
Excuse me, is one of you

112
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,266
Brian LeFeve?

113
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,137
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, hi.

114
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:12,505
It's nice to finally put
a face to the name.

115
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,506
I'm Andrew Kane.

116
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:14,507
Of course.

117
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:15,575
And Bill Larkin.

118
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:19,012
Oh, Bill, okay, now see, from
our conversations, I would have

119
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,446
pegged you for Bill. Crazy?

120
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:22,615
Oh, yeah, we get that sometimes.

121
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:23,583
Yeah?

122
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,819
And that must make you Prudence LeFeve.

123
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:26,787
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,521
Yeah, yeah. Hi, honey.

125
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:29,690
Hi.

126
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,457
And you are?

127
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:32,659
Vic Vinegar, bodyguard.

128
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,861
I don't shake, so don't even try.

129
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:35,896
Bodyguard?

130
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:37,964
Yeah, I mean, he's
really more of a driver.

131
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,066
He drives us around.

132
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,200
I protect their bodies.

133
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,301
He protects the car.

134
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,469
Well, I mean, we got all
week to talk about business.

135
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,605
So, uh, let's just kick back
and watch this game, huh?

136
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:46,807
Who needs a beer?

137
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:47,774
I do.

138
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:48,809
Oh, I'd love a beer.

139
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:49,810
Thank you. Thank you.

140
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:50,944
Vic, you're working.

141
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,179
You're working.

142
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:55,115
You are. A bodyguard, you
got to drive, too, stupid.

143
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,116
Yeah.

144
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,084
Cheers.

145
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:58,318
I'm not stupid. Not stupid.

146
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,221
All right.

147
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:04,457
Charlie, I want a list of the
top ten shareholders of the

148
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,760
company ASAP, and call the press.

149
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,028
Put out a press release.

150
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:10,496
Tell them the warthog
is back in business.

151
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:13,066
Also, there are too many
minorities and women working

152
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,500
here. What's up with that?

153
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:15,869
I got all that. I'm on it.

154
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:16,837
I'm on it.

155
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,872
Excuse me, excuse me, who is this man?

156
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,840
Charles Kelly.

157
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,808
I'm gonna be advising the
warthog in matters of business

158
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:22,943
and all the what have you.

159
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,944
Oh, everything.

160
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:24,911
Right-hand man, you got it?

161
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,914
I mean, there's gonna be some changes
around here, you understand?

162
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,382
Ah, look at this.

163
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,684
This poor kid, nobody's helping him.

164
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:32,986
Hey, hey, kid.

165
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,254
What's happening?

166
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:35,355
What is it?

167
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:36,356
Sorry, sir.

168
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,323
The darn thing won't print.

169
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,259
You mind if I take a look-see?

170
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:40,260
Oh, no.

171
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:43,063
I think it's a paper jam.

172
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:45,799
Yeah, there's the culprit.

173
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:46,767
Thanks, Mr. Warthog.

174
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:49,936
A jam, it was in the tray
three, and you didn't check.

175
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,673
It was hiding back there.

176
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:56,743
It was like a little piece of paper.

177
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,512
Let me... Whoa, let me
ask you a question.

178
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,048
Did I just do your job for you?

179
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,349
Excuse me?

180
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,019
Did I? Did I just do your job for you?

181
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:13,860
Uh, I-I guess so.

182
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,061
You're fired.

183
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,329
Get the hell out of here.

184
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:18,965
Go on, pack your shit
up and get out of here.

185
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,935
If we're gonna turn this company
around, we got to start cutting

186
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,771
the crust off this shit sandwich.

187
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,392
Fire in the hole, everybody.

188
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,705
Come on, work.

189
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,596
So, what do you think of our
latest proposal, LeFeve?

190
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:38,466
I think closing at 31's a
pretty fair deal, don't you?

191
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:42,704
31? Well, you know, guys, these things
tend to be a little complicated.

192
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,939
Oh, I
think ya can do better.

193
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,208
Oh, you looked over the proposal?

194
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,776
She glanced at it.

195
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:50,945
We're not... Tell us more about it.

196
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,748
Yah, I sure did, and I tell you
what, I seen better-looking

197
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:54,982
moose turds in Rick Moranis'

198
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,151
backyard, ya hosers. Mm?

199
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,656
She's got a sense of humor that would just...
You know, it gets frustrating.

200
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:03,624
Hey, come talk to me for a second.

201
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:04,792
Excuse me, guys.

202
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,560
Just...

203
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:07,027
What the hell are you doing, Dee?

204
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:07,862
We're Canadian.

205
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,464
You sound like a cartoon character.

206
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:10,631
Guys, let's get out of here.

207
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,367
Everybody's treating me like the help.

208
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:15,002
Well, you should have thought about that
before you blurted out, "bodyguard."

209
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,471
Mm. Oh, I got an idea.

210
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,705
Promote me to vice president.

211
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:18,639
That way, we can talk shop.

212
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:21,141
Mac, these gentlemen are courting
me for my business savvy.

213
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:24,144
How's it gonna reflect on me if
I promote my bodyguard to VP

214
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,347
after a two-minute
conversation at a ball game?

215
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,147
Mm-hmm.

216
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:31,786
It's not gonna reflect on you at all
because you're not Brian LeFeve.

217
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,388
I'm not what?

218
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:35,890
Dude, clearly you were floundering.

219
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,861
Mac, I was gathering information so
that I can more fully become this man.

220
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:43,964
Look, look, this is about
much more than just business.

221
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:47,869
This is about the thrill of
wearing another man's skin.

222
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:52,407
Feeling his innermost wants and
desires and being in control

223
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,875
of his every single move.

224
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,877
That's how you get off.

225
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:59,914
Now don't you guys want
to get off with me?

226
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,549
I don't know.

227
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:02,116
What?

228
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,786
I want you to get off with me.

229
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:05,686
Okay, okay.

230
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:06,888
Just follow my lead.

231
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:13,193
Guys, we're gonna get off together.

232
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:17,632
Gentlemen, I'm just
confused about one thing.

233
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,803
Now, you got me out of bed,
you put me on a plane, rolled

234
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,405
out the red carpet for, what was it, 31?

235
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:25,406
Vic, get my coat.

236
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:26,541
Let's get out of here.

237
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,208
Now hold on a second, LeFeve.

238
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,310
Give us a shot.

239
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,679
We will persuade you.

240
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:33,681
Get ready for a great week.

241
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,986
A little longer in the sock, huh?

242
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:40,120
Higher in the thigh.

243
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,189
So tell me the rundown
for tomorrow, Charlie.

244
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:43,658
Okay. We got a 8:30

245
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:45,993
appointment in the morning to
play racquetball in these new

246
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:49,196
outfits, then we're gonna head over to
Barneys, we're gonna shop for Rolexes.

247
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,499
After that, we zip by Atwater
where you're having your office

248
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,668
completely redone back to
its former 1980's glory.

249
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:56,771
And then we have a 5:00 sushi
dinner with Mr. Nakashori.

250
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:57,839
That all sound right?

251
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,039
Whoo! Sounds great, Charlie.

252
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,477
Good. Well, Frank, I'm a little
confused about one thing.

253
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,310
What's that?

254
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:04,579
Who pays for all this?

255
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:06,514
What do you mean, who pays for it?

256
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,849
The company pays for it.

257
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,784
All right, well, then
here's my second question.

258
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,186
What does Atwater make?

259
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:15,756
What do you mean, like, how much
money does the company make?

260
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:19,093
Oh, no, I mean <i>what do we make?</i>

261
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,127
<i>I don't follow.</i>

262
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,061
<i>We make money.</i>

263
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,197
<i>No, I know we make money.</i>

264
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,432
<i>I mean, what do we create?</i>

265
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,300
<i>We create wealth.</i>

266
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:30,638
<i>No, no, I mean, what do we build,
what do we design, you know?</i>

267
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:33,040
<i>Because I have some ideas that
could really help the company.</i>

268
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,742
<i>Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
we don't build anything.</i>

269
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,644
<i>Leave that to the Chinks.</i>

270
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:39,279
<i>Speaking of which, I want this
sushi dinner to be the tits.</i>

271
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:42,182
<i>Oh, okay, so you want it to
be, like, really expensive.</i>

272
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,821
<i>No, I want to eat sushi off
of some Jap broad's tits.</i>

273
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,123
<i>Hmm.</i>

274
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,899
<i>All right, guys, listen,
I whipped us up a couple</i>

275
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:00,267
<i>of backstories here, so
take a look at these cards.</i>

276
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,236
<i>On the front, you're gonna find
your biographical information.</i>

277
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,171
<i>On the back, that's your
emotional blueprint.</i>

278
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,872
<i>Hmm.</i>

279
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,273
<i>I have my own backstory, Dennis.</i>

280
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,543
<i>I'm an entrepreneurial bodyguard
with his own line of fitness</i>

281
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,176
<i>products.</i>

282
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:10,578
<i>I want to pitch the guys out.</i>

283
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,614
<i>No, no, guys, guy, please,
you got to trust me, okay?</i>

284
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:16,617
<i>Just follow my lead, and I am
gonna get you off in ways you</i>

285
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:17,451
<i>never believed existed.</i>

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,619
<i>I'm in.</i>

287
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,488
<i>I'm not. I don't even know
what you're talking about.</i>

288
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:22,957
<i>I just want to do some business stuff.</i>

289
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:23,758
<i>No.</i>

290
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:28,395
<i>Okay, LeFeve, we have a
surprise you are gonna love.</i>

291
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:29,296
<i>Ah, really?</i>

292
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:32,533
<i>Trust me, we know exactly what you like.</i>

293
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:33,834
<i>Head on down to the members'</i>

294
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:38,172
<i>locker room and see for yourself.</i>

295
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,907
<i>Dennis, I have business savvy.</i>

296
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:42,509
<i>I can be more than just
the bodyguard, okay?</i>

297
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:43,343
<i>I've got ideas.</i>

298
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:44,278
<i>Oh, you got ideas?</i>

299
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,146
<i>Pitch me one of your ideas right now.</i>

300
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,448
<i>Right now?</i>

301
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,916
<i>Off the top of my head?</i>

302
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:49,650
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

303
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:50,250
<i>Um, bodyguards.</i>

304
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,720
<i>What about bodyguards?</i>

305
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,789
<i>Training bodyguards, putting
them in a facility and...</i>

306
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:55,690
<i>What about them?</i>

307
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:56,924
<i>Oh, what about a resort?</i>

308
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:58,292
<i>That's a totally different thing.</i>

309
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,360
<i>Are you saying that because
we're in a resort?</i>

310
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:01,462
<i>Stick to the one thing.</i>

311
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,262
<i>What about bodyguards?</i>

312
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,163
<i>A resort for bodyguards?</i>

313
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:04,065
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

314
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,467
<i>Oh, hey, you must be Mr. LeFeve?</i>

315
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:07,534
<i>Uh, yeah, that's me.</i>

316
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:09,704
<i>Surprise. I'm all yours.</i>

317
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:13,340
<i>I was told there'd just be one,
but I can take both of you.</i>

318
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:15,676
<i>Might get a little sore, but I'll manage.</i>

319
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,678
<i>Okay, well, I'm out of here.</i>

320
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:20,081
<i>Okay. Wait. What?</i>

321
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:21,782
<i>Hey, hey, where you going?</i>

322
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,119
<i>LeFeve's into banging little Asian
boys, so we're done, right?</i>

323
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,888
<i>If we're gonna do this thing,
we need to see things through.</i>

324
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:31,458
<i>Dennis, are you gonna have
sex with a tiny Asian boy?</i>

325
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:35,529
<i>I'm gonna see how far I can go.</i>

326
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:36,263
<i>Okay.</i>

327
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,164
<i>Are you with me?</i>

328
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,699
<i>No. No, I'm going to leave now.</i>

329
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,835
<i>That's your goddamn problem,
pal, you don't know your limits</i>

330
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:42,637
<i>'cause you're not willing
to push yourself.</i>

331
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:43,570
<i>I know my limits!</i>

332
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,705
<i>This is my limit. I quit.</i>

333
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:45,305
<i>You quit?</i>

334
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:45,906
<i>Yes!</i>

335
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:48,609
<i>Well, guess what, pal, you can't
quit 'cause you're fired, Vic!</i>

336
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:49,576
<i>You're out of here!</i>

337
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,512
<i>See? You got no commitment, Vinegar!</i>

338
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,147
<i>You're finished!</i>

339
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:56,751
<i>You're never gonna get anywhere in life!</i>

340
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:02,189
<i>All right, LeFeve, time to put
your money where your mouth is.</i>

341
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,759
<i>Let's kick things up a notch.</i>

342
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:08,629
<i>So, only the ones set of clubs?</i>

343
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:10,831
<i>Yeah, you're a caddy.</i>

344
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,901
<i>Clubs... This is a golf...
Good. Yeah, okay.</i>

345
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:16,937
<i>Well, that's better than
what I was about to...</i>

346
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:20,941
<i>Whoo! Let me, um...
Give me a minute.</i>

347
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,309
<i>I need to switch gears.</i>

348
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:23,477
<i>I almost... Yeah.</i>

349
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:25,713
<i>Take your time.</i>

350
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:33,154
<i>Okay, first off, your dry
cleaning's all done, the</i>

351
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,155
<i>company jet's been upgraded.</i>

352
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:36,023
<i>I got rid of that piece of trash.</i>

353
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:36,657
<i>Nice!</i>

354
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:39,459
<i>Okay, now, secondly, I found
out who the controlling</i>

355
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:40,627
<i>shareholder of Atwater is.</i>

356
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:41,328
<i>Who?</i>

357
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,998
<i>Brian LeFeve.</i>

358
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:44,899
<i>Who?</i>

359
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,533
<i>Brian LeFeve.</i>

360
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,367
<i>The wallet they found?</i>

361
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:47,968
<i>Holy shit!</i>

362
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:48,569
<i>Yeah.</i>

363
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:50,237
<i>He was probably there to see me.</i>

364
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,406
<i>Dennis has been going around
pretending to be him, and</i>

365
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:53,808
<i>stringing along the Wheeler guys.</i>

366
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,675
<i>This is great, Charlie.</i>

367
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:58,079
<i>We keep the Wheeler guys off
our asses, and we fix Atwater!</i>

368
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,680
<i>Huh? Good move.</i>

369
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:00,715
<i>Right? Pretty good.</i>

370
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:01,582
<i>Oh, Nakashori's here.</i>

371
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,085
<i>Yeah, but this is...
Hello, Mr. Nakashori.</i>

372
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:06,954
<i>Ah, welcome, welcome.</i>

373
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:12,259
<i>You bring us a great honor
to join with us, and we have</i>

374
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:16,797
<i>many a naked woman and the
fish of pleasure for you...</i>

375
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,632
<i>Charlie, what are you doing?</i>

376
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,701
<i>What are you talking broken English for?</i>

377
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,703
<i>I thought they could
understand me better if I...</i>

378
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:23,871
<i>No, no, no. Sit down.</i>

379
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:27,374
<i>Let's eat some sushi and
we'll talk business later.</i>

380
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,110
<i>Enjoy yourself.</i>

381
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:30,878
<i>So...</i>

382
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,980
<i>A few interesting facts about our city.</i>

383
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:37,118
<i>Uh, there's been an abundance
of crow eggs all around Philly.</i>

384
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:39,954
<i>Uh, and crows seem to be getting bigger.</i>

385
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:42,223
<i>By the year and the day, even.</i>

386
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,658
<i>And their eggs, of course,
are getting bigger as well.</i>

387
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:48,763
<i>Perhaps our companies, with this
information, could find a way to</i>

388
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,933
<i>create some products off these new...
Charlie, Charlie...</i>

389
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,201
<i>Excuse us.</i>

390
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,036
<i>Charlie, come here, listen to me.</i>

391
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:56,837
<i>Look at me.</i>

392
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:57,638
<i>Yeah.</i>

393
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:58,438
<i>You're fired.</i>

394
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,273
<i>What?</i>

395
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,074
<i>You're fired.</i>

396
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:00,875
<i>Why?</i>

397
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,777
<i>Because you're not getting it.</i>

398
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:03,644
<i>It's not sinkin' in.</i>

399
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,444
<i>I don't get it?</i>

400
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,246
<i>No.</i>

401
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,947
<i>Where did you get that awesome
insider info from, about</i>

402
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:07,748
<i>Brian LeFeve, huh?</i>

403
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:08,548
<i>That was pretty big.</i>

404
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:09,449
<i>Well, that was good, Charlie.</i>

405
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,717
<i>That's good.</i>

406
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:15,856
<i>But you keep talking about products
and quality and-and making things...</i>

407
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,095
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

408
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,305
<i>You're out.</i>

409
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:37,529
Well, thanks for the insider info,
Mac, but that did not work.

410
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,757
Frank canned me.

411
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:40,643
He did?

412
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:41,444
Yeah!

413
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:42,278
What a dick!

414
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,728
You know Dennis wouldn't even
listen to my business ideas?

415
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:45,582
Are you serious?

416
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,383
I'm brimming with all these
great business ideas.

417
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,626
Oh, tell me about it.
I don't know what to do with it.

418
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,707
Oh, my God, I pitched so many good ideas...
or I tried to, at least.

419
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:52,675
And Frank shoots 'em down,
'cause he doesn't care about...

420
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:54,377
I wish we could go into
business together, you know?

421
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,044
That would be... that would
be good, it would make sense.

422
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,481
Yeah, well, I feel like you and I...
you and I understand each other.

423
00:14:58,548 --> 00:14:59,281
We click, you know?

424
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,285
I have to warn you, though, that
it's all about the product for me.

425
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:02,447
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

426
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,772
That's what I was saying
to Frank the entire time.

427
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,616
That's what people care
about, is the product.

428
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,153
It's all about the product, right?
He only cares about money.

429
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,095
Money has nothing to do with it.

430
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:10,564
It's about a... Oh... You
and I are on the same page.

431
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:13,268
I know, we're always clicking with... And we
have insane business savvy, and I feel like...

432
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:14,783
Excuse me.

433
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,162
I need to speak to the owners.

434
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,016
Yeah, that's us.

435
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:19,850
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,895
Does the name Brian LeFeve
mean anything to you guys?

437
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,877
Okay, LeFeve, enough.

438
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:36,600
We took you out the yacht, we took you
to the zoo, we took you to that massage

439
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,902
parlor and paid to have
them jerk you both off.

440
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:39,955
The meeting's about to start.

441
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,657
We need to know, are you
going to sell or not?

442
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,486
Guys, we are almost there.

443
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,440
I promise you, we are so close.

444
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,576
Oh, okay!

445
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,847
All right, I want to welcome all
of you Atwater investors, and

446
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:59,088
especially our controlling
shareholder, Mr. Brian LeFeve.

447
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:00,322
Thanks, Frank.

448
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,290
Oh.

449
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,191
Thank you.

450
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:02,992
All right.

451
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,929
I'm very excited about your passion for the
company, so let's get right down to business.

452
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:08,597
Not so fast!

453
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,766
There's something you all
need to know about Atwater!

454
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,469
Prepare to have your minds blown.

455
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:15,371
We got a video.

456
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:16,372
Boom!

457
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,339
Huh?

458
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:20,442
What up?

459
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,978
Are you ready for the best idea ever?

460
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,079
Do you have money?

461
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,481
Do you want even more money?

462
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,017
Well, guess what?

463
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:31,620
We've got a great idea for you.

464
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,990
I... no, I told you not to... stay out
of my peripheral through the whole...

465
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:35,824
...two, one.

466
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:36,625
Fight Milk!

467
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:43,632
The first alcoholic, dairy-based protein
drink for bodyguards... By bodyguard!

468
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,001
I drink it every morning so
I can fight like the crow.

469
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,803
Just get out of the way.

470
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,637
There we go.

471
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:51,040
It's all about the product shot.

472
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:51,706
Where do I stand?

473
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:55,311
Don't do the whole... I wanted for
them to see the whole... Fight Milk!

474
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:57,712
Crow's egg!

475
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,082
Milk!

476
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:02,918
Made fresh.

477
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,786
By bodyguards.

478
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:05,787
And Charlie.

479
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:06,533
What up?

480
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:09,992
Watch as profits soar high as a crow.

481
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,893
Watch your profits soar high as a crow.

482
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:18,561
Ow.

483
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:19,361
Sorry.

484
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,103
Wait, I thought we said I was gonna...
Profits... Yeah, go with your right.

485
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:21,997
To the right hand.

486
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,632
Uh, anyway, who wants to invest?

487
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,634
So what's this got to do with Atwater?

488
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:26,468
Oh, nothing.

489
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:28,671
No, um, we just didn't want
to lead with the Atwater news

490
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:31,440
because we figured you wouldn't
stick around to watch the video.

491
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,322
So what's the news?

492
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:34,242
Oh! Yeah, right.

493
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,411
Well, that's not Brian LeFeve!

494
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:40,882
This is Brian LeFeve.

495
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:42,984
Yeah.

496
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,153
Yeah, apparently he came to the
bar to talk to Frank, and I

497
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:48,390
didn't recognize him from his
picture in his wallet, but I did

498
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,492
recognize it when I saw that
dead face in the morgue.

499
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,193
Yeah, I was like, I
remember that dude, yeah.

500
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,194
Yeah.

501
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:55,063
He came to the bar, and I
remember he had to take a piss.

502
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:57,598
Yeah, he was having a couple drinks and then...
But Charlie was in the

503
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,533
bathroom cleaning it out.

504
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,367
I was working.

505
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:01,169
I'm like, "Dude, take
it out to the alley."

506
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:04,305
And then I guess he's out in the alley,
he comes back in, he forgot his wallet.

507
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,340
Mac's like, "ID please."

508
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:07,509
Yeah, he doesn't get in without an ID.

509
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:08,309
That's just the rule.

510
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,311
The guy's got no ID, so now he's
roaming around the alleyway

511
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,246
looking for his wallet.

512
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:13,948
Crackhead comes up to him, says,
"Hey, man, give me your money."

513
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:15,950
And the guy's like, "I
can't, I got no money."

514
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:16,851
And he's like, "Bullshit."

515
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,421
He got stabbed a bunch around
the abdomen and... uh, kind of

516
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,990
bled out and sort of died.

517
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:23,858
Why do you got his finger?

518
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:24,825
Oh.

519
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:28,563
Well, the whole finger thing is...
This was a miscommunication.

520
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,630
This is a stupid thing, man.

521
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:32,133
This guy here... He's like,
"Dude, get a fingerprint."

522
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:33,201
And I heard, "Get a fingertip."

523
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,270
And I chopped his finger off
really quick and then I'm like,

524
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:36,104
"Is this what you want?"

525
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:37,272
He starts screaming, you know.

526
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:38,940
Hey, wait a minute, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

527
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:43,010
If Brian LeFeve is dead... then
who the hell are these people?

528
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,714
Just a couple of people
who totally got off, bro.

529
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,715
What?

530
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:48,516
You did?

531
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,151
Mm... Are you serious?

532
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:50,985
Mm-hmm, yeah.

533
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:51,953
Just... during this?

534
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,255
Big time, yeah.

535
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:56,191
Oh, yeah, I got off a couple
times when we were watching the

536
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:57,058
video presentation.

537
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,826
Then when he called me out
for not being Brian LeFeve?

538
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,308
Whoo, that got me big time.

539
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:01,161
That did it?

540
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:01,995
Oh, man, did I get off.

541
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:03,147
Yeah, and then he showed the finger.

542
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,465
- That was the big one.
- A dead finger got you off.

543
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,604
- That was the climax, really.
- I am so confused.

544
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,668
Oh, my God, it was amazing.

545
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:09,502
It was mostly sexual.

546
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,304
God damn you, okay?

547
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:11,138
You know what?

548
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:12,940
I could've gotten some
cash out of these men.

549
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,774
I could've gotten a free pair of
shoes, but no, you said, "Hang

550
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,643
in there, I'll help you get off,
I'll help you get off, Dee.

551
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:17,544
I'll show you how to do it."

552
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,346
And then you leave me all on my
own to try and just get off all

553
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:21,009
by myself without even... I
did everything that I could.

554
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:22,272
I don't understand why
you couldn't get off.

555
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,125
It's not my fault.

556
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,126
Some women just don't know how.

557
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:24,928
What?!

558
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:25,862
I don't know what it is.

559
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,663
You know?

560
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,464
Sometimes it's only the guy who gets off.

561
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:31,100
Well, look, I don't know what
the hell's going on over there.

562
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,571
But I can tell you something,
that there is something really,

563
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:37,674
palpable, wonderful going on over here.

564
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,109
I love this company.

565
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,525
I love it more than life.

566
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:43,846
I built this company with these hands.

567
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,481
Built it from the ground up.

568
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:47,784
This is a comp...

569
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,419
Excuse me.

570
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,889
Hello?

571
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,420
It's done?

572
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,604
Oh. Good.

573
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:57,359
Right.

574
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:01,756
All right, that's it. It's over, you can all go.
The company's gone.

575
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:03,792
What are you talking about?

576
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,218
I stripped the company, sold it to
the Chinks, and they shut it down.

577
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,249
In a sense, you're all fired.

578
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:11,216
Out.

579
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:12,050
You can all go.

580
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:12,965
Thank you, and good-bye.

581
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,083
Get out, get out, go.

582
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,754
Frank, whoa, whoa.

583
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,848
I... dude, I do not understand.

584
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:18,901
I thought you loved the company.

585
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,042
I do.

586
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:20,895
But not more than money.

587
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,730
And I just made a shitload of it.

588
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:23,564
You get it?

589
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,532
Yeah.

590
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,949
See, Charlie?

591
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,017
Speaking of which, tell me
more about this Crowtein.
