1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:02,389
Give me the walkie.

2
00:00:02,454 --> 00:00:05,164
Frank, I'm having a hard time
understanding what we're doing here.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,248
- Just give me the|walkie-talkie.
- All right.

4
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:09,782
Why did you hide your
will in the ceiling?

5
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:11,849
I didn't do it.
Charlie did it.

6
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:13,866
Why did Charlie hide
your will in the ceiling?

7
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:16,804
Because I didn't want to crawl
around these goddamn vents.

8
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:18,757
- Give me my gun.
- Oh, right.

9
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,502
Dude, I don't think you should be
carrying this thing anymore, man.

10
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,970
I mean, it always gets
you into trouble.

11
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:25,907
Recently it has occurred to me

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,716
that Dennis and Deandra stand to lose a
lot of money because they're not my kids.

13
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,363
They're gonna rub me out.

14
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,109
Frank, you're being very
paranoid about this.

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,786
If you just go to a lawyer, you can
draft up a new will, no big deal.

16
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,884
Don't overthink this.
Trust me.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,433
Give me the goddamn gun.

18
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:42,468
Now, do you think you can make
sense of Charlie's map,

19
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,083
because it's as dark as a well
digger's ass up here.

20
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:49,118
Frank, no one understands the subtleties
of Charlie's retardation better than me.

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,151
I can guide you right to it.

22
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,211
Then you will be handsomely rewarded.

23
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:55,116
- I like that.
- Shit.

24
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,375
- What's that?
- Seal me up, seal me up.

25
00:00:57,476 --> 00:00:58,976
Get it. Just get it! Shut!

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,837
What I say is the law.
I'm the boss of both of you now.

27
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,045
What are you talking about, man?

28
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,872
Why are you standing like that?

29
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:08,276
Because I'm your big brother, dude,
and I'm the boss of you.

30
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:10,471
Where is this coming from, man?
You are not our big brother.

31
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,989
Yes, I am, so get me
a beer, little bro,

32
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,226
before I give you a serious noogie.

33
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:17,735
Dude, I swear to God, if you try and
give me a noogie,

34
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:21,492
I will yank your underwear over your head
so hard your asshole will rip in half.

35
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:22,984
What's up, bitches?

36
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:24,696
Mac, can an asshole rip in half?

37
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:26,234
Like tissue paper.

38
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,194
- Are they behind us?
- Back up!

39
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,670
Whoa, whoa, what the
hell are you guys doing?

40
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,924
Okay, okay, don't shoot, okay?

41
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,457
- Just take whatever you want.
- Yeah, take the cash register.

42
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:36,374
Take the girl.

43
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,282
- What do you mean, take the girl?
- Don't argue with them, just go.

44
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:39,540
You'd better just go with them.

45
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:40,411
But they're not trying to
take me anywhere.

46
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,339
Don't try to be a hero,
Dee, just do what they say.

47
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,060
- They're not saying anything.
- What's the sense?

48
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:46,546
If you keep arguing with them,
then we're all going to die.

49
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,128
- We don't want the girl.
- So take the cash.

50
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,553
- We don't want the cash.
- Well, then, what the hell do you want?!

51
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:58,716
We're taking you bitches hostage.

52
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:03,074

55
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:34,128
That's right, and we need a gassed-up boat
and we need 100,000 clams in a briefcase.

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,937
And a Planet Hollywood jacket...
a leather one.

57
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,583
Reversible.

58
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:42,086
We need a reversible
Planet Hollywood jacket, too.

59
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,007
I can't believe this is happening.
Taken hostage by McPoyles?

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,184
- We should just bum rush 'em.
- Hey, I'm the one making the demands here,

61
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:51,241
pig, and if they're not met in one hour,
I'm going to kill one of the hostages.

62
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:52,658
You hear that?

63
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,268
In one hour, we're going to have
Margaret shoot one of you in the face.

64
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,312
And if any of you try to escape,
we'll massacre you in a blaze of glory.

65
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,341
Then play with your bodies.
Especially Dennis.

66
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,101
Let's secure the perimeter.

67
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:10,235
Holy shit.

68
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,720
Did you hear that?
I think he means it.

69
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,189
There's no way they're going
to get those demands.

70
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,432
They can't get a Planet Hollywood jacket.
Those places don't even exist anymore.

71
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:17,821
They don't even make those jackets.
They'd have to call Stallone or something.

72
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:20,000
- He's not going to give his up.
- Maybe Ackroyd?

73
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:22,437
- They're not going to part with theirs.
- Shut up.

74
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,762
We need to focus, okay?
This is serious.

75
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:27,102
We could get Stockholm syndrome.

76
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,926
Oh, my God, what is that?
What is it?

77
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:31,007
Does it start with a sore throat?
Because I think I might be getting it.

78
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,815
No, you're not getting it, Charlie.

79
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,252
I'm sorry, you a doctor?
I don't think you're qualified

80
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,464
to tell me whether or not I'm coming
down with Stockholm syndrome.

81
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,175
Stockholm syndrome...
it messes with your mind.

82
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,709
You start to empathize and then
you could side with your captors.

83
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,227
- We could turn against each other.
- Dee is right.

84
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,971
Look, we need to watch out
for each other, okay?

85
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,514
The only way we're going to get
through this is if we stick together.

86
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,215
Nobody has to die.

87
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:53,653
- Somebody has to die.
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,574
- It doesn't have to be one of us.
- No, it shouldn't be!

89
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,575
It may as well be Mac or Charlie, right?
What do they have to live for?

90
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,415
- Not one thing.
- So we need to form a pact.

91
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:01,894
No matter what happens,
you and I have to stick together.

92
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:05,134
- You and I will form an alliance.
- We'll form an alliance.

93
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,583
Dennis is going to try
and have you killed.

94
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:10,552
I can't say that surprises me.

95
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,183
He's going to sell
us all down the river.

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,232
Okay, should we kill
him first or something?

97
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:16,702
Hey, look, I don't want anybody
to have to die, but if somebody does...

98
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,978
- there's no reason it shouldn't be Dennis.
- It should be Dennis, right?

99
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,495
- He had a great life...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

100
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,933
- He had a full, full good ride.
- Oh, a fantastic ride.

101
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:26,321
- I had a terrible ride.
- Charlie, you had the worst ride.

102
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:28,613
- I had the worst ride anyone, could...
- You deserve another shot at the ride.

103
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,373
- I want a better ride!
- Oh, you ought to ride and ride.

104
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,906
So listen, here's what we do.

105
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,989
You and I, no matter what,
we got to stick together.

106
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,667
We got stick together. We should get
to Mac though, before Dennis does.

107
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,444
- Mac will be with us.
- Mac will be with us.

108
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,187
Frank, Frank come in, Frank.

109
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:43,609
The McPoyles have taken us hostage and
they're threatening to kill all of us.

110
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,997
It's too late for the guys, but
there's plenty of time to save me.

111
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,724
So come down here
and get me out of here.

112
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,161
Where the hell have you been?

113
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:50,775
I've been looking
for you for 20 minutes.

114
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,422
I'm lost as shit up here.

115
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:55,591
<i>McPoyles have taken over the bar.
They're threatening to kill one of us.</i>

116
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:58,425
<i>- Come save me.
- Holy crap.</i>

117
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:59,554
Forget about the rest of them, Frank.

118
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:02,880
They're all going to perish. It's just me.
There's still time to save me. Get down here.

119
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,348
<i>Not until I get that will.</i>

120
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,238
Once that will is safe and secure,
I'll come and help you.

121
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,031
Will? There's plenty of time to do that.
We can do that some other time, dude.

122
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,598
No. This is all the more reason
to get that document.

123
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,293
Who the hell knows how it's
going to shake out down there.

124
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,069
Everybody gather round.

125
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,925
I got to go.
I'll call you back.

126
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,783
All right, there's absolutely no way
they're going to meet all our demands.

127
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:28,285
So you guys are going to dig a
hole straight through the wall

128
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,595
to the next building. We're going to
go to the roof and escape by helicopter.

129
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,052
- Man, come on...
- Here's how it's going to work.

130
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,937
Two of you are going to dig while
two of you rest, and then you switch.

131
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,727
I volunteer to rest first.

132
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,052
Bullshit. You can't volunteer to rest.

133
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,818
Oh, really? Well, you can
be on my team if you want,

134
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,360
but my team rests first
'cause I called it.

135
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,367
All right, great. Then it's it's settled...
I'm on your team. We'll rest first.

136
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:46,234
Charlie and Mac, you dig.

137
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:48,093
You're going to be on Dee's
team? Some loyalty, bro.

138
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:49,952
Dude! What the hell, man... you
don't want to be on my dig team?

139
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:53,428
Easy, Charlie... I never said that. I feel
like the syndrome's making you all paranoid.

140
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,667
- It's making me crazy, dude. I feel like
- Hold on.

141
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:55,878
- my throat is burning.
- Oh, my God, he's burning up.

142
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,977
- Am I burning up?
- You got to sit down.

143
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,335
- Okay. Oh, my God, I'm getting sick.
- You got to sit down.

144
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:01,093
Guys, clearly Charlie's coming down
with a nasty case of Stockholm syndrome.

145
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,681
Now the last thing you guys need
is a room full of sick hostages.

146
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,158
So, guys, you mind if I grab a
couple of beers, 'cause I feel like

147
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,180
we would be a lot more
relaxed if we had some beer...

148
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,712
Oh, and a cooler. Dude, get a cooler.

149
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:11,075
- Good idea, Charlie.
- That way we can keep the beers cold.

150
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,469
- All right.
- Uh, uh.

151
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,952
Dude, what the hell? The cooler's
going to keep the beer cold.

152
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:16,679
Well, how are we going to do
that without a cooler, man?

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,929
- I would appreciate a cold beer.
- We'll should probably...

154
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,227
- Yeah, we should probably all have
- Yes, sir. Some beer,

155
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,685
- cold beer inside of a cooler.
- and a cooler. Allright.

156
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:21,921
- I wanna take a vote.
- We'll drink some beer.

157
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,712
All in favor of beer in
coolers... great, great.

158
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,392
Then it's settled.
Charlie, go get a cooler.

159
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:30,725
It's a double, Charlie... no beer no
cooler. Margaret, put your hand down.

160
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:33,070
- But your sister agrees with us.
- Yeah, she agreed with us, man.

161
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:37,322
She's a deaf mute. The only reason she
raised her hand, is 'cause you guys did.

162
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,153
Really? Let's try that again, right?

163
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:42,946
Awesome!

164
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:44,220
Yeah, I wonder what else
we could get her to do?

165
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:46,670
- Ah, let's blink, let's blink really fast.
- Okay.

166
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:49,647
Oh, come on, that's awesome.

167
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:54,164
All right, put your hands down and
stop blinking! Leave Margaret alone.

168
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:58,053
You two in the bathroom, you two grab
some shovels. Ryan, crank up the heat.

169
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:02,869
We're going to get this place hot and
clammy. Just like the McPoyles like it.

170
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:10,193
Ah. Here we go. Charlie, what
are you trying to tell me?

171
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:16,735
"If here by now than bad place bee.

172
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,247
Troubled time

173
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:25,064
for you when heat comes".

174
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:29,030
Jesus Christ, the kid's an idiot.

175
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:34,862
Wha... wha...? Oh, shit! What it was?

176
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,981
Damn, man, they're really
cranking that heat, huh?

177
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,767
Yeah, man, maybe that's
why she dressed in that.

178
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,166
Oh, of course that's why
they dressed like that.

179
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,408
They're going to stay all nice and
cool while we get all hot and steamy.

180
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,913
Why are you covering
your mouth like that?

181
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,206
So she can't read my lips. Dude,
I don't want her reading my lips.

182
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,699
- Her? She can't read lips. No way.
- You don't think?

183
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,833
Here, check this out. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

184
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,661
No? Can you understand the words

185
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:03,465
- that I am saying?
- Do you know what I am saying?

186
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,361
You can't read lips, can you?

187
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:07,108
- Right. All right, Charlie... There's
- What was that?

188
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:08,740
- something I've got to talk to you about.
- Yeah?

189
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:10,368
I need you to help me out with this map.

190
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:12,998
Whoa! What are you
doing with my map, dude?

191
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,958
Frank gave it to me. All right,
he's up in the vents, all right?

192
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,270
He's going to try and retrieve his will.

193
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:18,066
Now if I guide him to it successfully,

194
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:21,653
he's going to give me a very large percentage
of that. He thinks that Dennis and Dee...

195
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:23,008
- What are you doing?
- It's boring, dude.

196
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,001
I'm getting bored over here.

197
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,248
You should be paying attention, Charlie,

198
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:27,173
- because this could be very good for you.
- Come on, come on,

199
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,782
- come on, you're losing me.
- Oh, my God.

200
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,802
With Frank dead, and the will
gone, Charlie gets all the money!

201
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,236
- I get all the money? What money?
- All the money.

202
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,128
- The inheritance money.
- Okay, good, good.

203
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,660
- Do you understand what's happening?
- Yeah! Good! Kind of.

204
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:39,959
Do you understand what's
going on with this map?

205
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,873
- Yes.
- Okay.

206
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:42,808
Now, just walk me through it and
we'll go through the numbers later.

207
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,661
It's a fake map... it's a decoy.

208
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:45,974
- Really?
- Yep.

209
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:49,714
- Where's the real map?
- The real map is tattooed on my body.

210
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:52,796
- Get out of here! Where?
- Yeah. Right here.

211
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:56,479
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm dead serious.

212
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,751
- This is impossible.
- It's very possible.

213
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,007
Dude, I'm not looking in your butt.

214
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:03,104
You have to, dude. That's
the only way to find the will.

215
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:05,684
All right. But you've got
to swear not to tell anybody.

216
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:06,683
I swear.

217
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,694
- I can't see anything.
- Look closer.

218
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:20,253
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

219
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,843
- What do you smell?
- Oh, my God!

220
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,566
You farted in my face?!
You farted in my face?!

221
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,195
- What do you think?
- Are you kidding me?

222
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,599
- Why would you do something like that?
- Why?

223
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,369
'Cause you stole my map
and Frank's in the vent.

224
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,284
You're lying to me, we could die today, and
that's what the fart in your face was for.

225
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,499
All right, we don't have time for
this, all right? Where's the real map?

226
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,251
That's the real map.
There's no fake map, idiot.

227
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,419
- Jesus Christ!
- Are you kidding me?

228
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,296
- This is just unbelievable.
- How could anybody like it this hot?

229
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,539
- I feel woozy.
- This is bullshit.

230
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,491
A couple of glasses of milk.
Lukewarm; skim for the lady.

231
00:09:56,492 --> 00:10:00,455
- Look, we don't want your milk, Liam.
- Then start breaking bricks, wet nips.

232
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,435
- You know what, I think you're full of shit.
- Is that right?

233
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,994
Yeah, that's right. I think I
can walk out of here right now

234
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,940
and I don't think you'd do anything
'cause I don't think you're serious.

235
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,500
- You don't think I'm serious?
- No, I don't think you're serious.

236
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,990
- Now, you think I'm bluffing?
- I think you're bluffing.

237
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,326
- You think I'm bluffing?
- I think you're bluffing.

238
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,944
Than bluff this.
Ryan, stab somebody.

239
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:22,623
What have you done,
man? Give me the milk.

240
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:23,673
Showing 'em we're not bluffing.

241
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,753
Damn! You're supposed to stab
one of them. You stab one of them.

242
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,743
I got to take care of this.

243
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,276
- Oh, shit!
- My bad.

244
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,920
- Oh, my God.
- One of the most terrifying things

245
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:38,983
- I mean,
- I've ever seen in my life, Dee.

246
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:42,934
That must have taken so much heart...
you know, to stab your brother like that.

247
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:46,077
- I mean, that is real dedication.
- What?

248
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,671
Whatever, okay. Look, I think
we need a real plan here.

249
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:50,437
- The hour's coming upon us, okay?
- Yes. Yes.

250
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,400
Oh! Look, maybe I can corner
one of them, all right?

251
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,039
I'll manipulate them,
get inside their head.

252
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,152
And have sex with them.

253
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,770
Have sex with them? No. I was going
to say pit them against each other.

254
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:00,608
What? I know.

255
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:01,932
What? What did I say?

256
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:02,978
- You said...
- No!

257
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:04,935
Oh, God, no.
Those guys are disgusting.

258
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:08,202
Dee, I think you're starting to
show signs of Stockholm syndrome.

259
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:09,482
No, listen, I'm fine, all right?

260
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,412
Can we just focus here?
Just tell me what the plan is.

261
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,179
Let's focus. Okay, here's the plan.

262
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:15,513
I know I can get the girl to
fall in love with me, okay?

263
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,278
Now I know I'm not one of the
members of her family.

264
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:18,821
I got that going against me.
But...

265
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:21,176
I do have a secret weapon.

266
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,324
Boom. All right?

267
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:26,147
I just need to get alone with her
and let the pecs do the talking.

268
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:29,468
One thing will lead to the next...
she'll lead me secretly to safety.

269
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,966
Mac, what's with the
goddamn heat?

270
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,695
I'm roasting like a
suckling pig up here.

271
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,435
Uh, yeah, man, it's getting pretty
hot up in this piece, huh?

272
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:44,324
Must be miserable up
in those vents, Frank.

273
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:46,116
Charlie, is that you?

274
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:47,752
Yeah, it's me.

275
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:51,637
Hey, are you lost? I warned you never
to go up in those vents without me.

276
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,547
Uh, yeah, a little bit.

277
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,653
Hey, Charlie...

278
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,550
You think you could give the
walkie-talkie over to Mac?

279
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,272
I got to talk to him privately.

280
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:02,227
Yeah, hold on a second.

281
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,406
Yo, buddy, I'm here.

282
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,422
Mac, go somewhere
where you're alone.

283
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:11,813
Okay, Frank, we're alone.

284
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:17,514
Whatever happens, make sure
Charlie's the first one to die.

285
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:20,665
What? Why?

286
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,490
Because of this will business,
he stands to gain the most out of it.

287
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,601
- That's a very good point.
- That's an excellent point, all right.

288
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,126
Uh, that's a good plan, Frank.
I'll get back to you in about ten.

289
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,721
All right get back to me.
Ten-four.

290
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,675
Okay, well, I think it's pretty
clear what we should do.

291
00:12:35,737 --> 00:12:36,727
- Yeah.
- Frank has to die.

292
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,387
- Gotta kill Frank.
- Gotta kill him somehow.

293
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,588
So once the McPoyles take out
Dennis, Dee and Frank...

294
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:41,119
Yeah.

295
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,505
then you and I will split the
money right down the middle.

296
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:46,890
That's kind of a lot,
don't you think?

297
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:48,273
- I'll tell you what...
- No, what?

298
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:49,257
I'll give you 25%.

299
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,351
25%?

300
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:54,019
Hey, ball sacks, put those on.

301
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,259
Why?

302
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,043
It's too obvious who the hostages
and who the captors are.

303
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,855
We're gonna confuse the cops.

304
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:10,289
All right, your time is almost up.

305
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:13,597
And we thought we'd spice things up with
an immunity challenge. The team who wins

306
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,852
will be exempt from the first
round of shootings in the face.

307
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,595
- Oh, that's a great idea!
- Dee, shut up.

308
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:21,009
- What the hell is she talking about?
- She's got Stockholm syndrome.

309
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,347
No, I don't.

310
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:25,802
No, I just think it's a good way
to decide who to kill first.

311
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,239
I'm trying to put myself in
their position, you know,

312
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,911
it's called compassion,
dickheads.

313
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,100
Maybe if you guys
had a little bit of it

314
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,293
you wouldn't be in this
mess in the first place.

315
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,691
And then we wouldn't be standing
here, trying to figure out

316
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,186
which one of you we
have to kill, but

317
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,768
that's where we are, so
hand me that shotgun.

318
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,692
'Cause I'd like to do
this mess myself.

319
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:45,216
Get on your knees, bitches!

320
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,131
What are you doing?
Now you're on their side?

321
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,193
You wanna be a McPoyle,
trash bag?

322
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:55,089
If you wanna be a McPoyle, you've
gotta earn that the hard way.

323
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,287
And you will learn that later on.
But for now the challenge is this:

324
00:13:58,412 --> 00:14:00,798
Whoever can destroy more things
on the inside of this bar wins.

325
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,285
And the teams have changed.

326
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,048
It's now Dee and Charlie versus
Mac and Dennis.

327
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,015
You have one minute to
plan your strategy.

328
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,911
Starting now.

329
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:12,158
Ooh, come, come here,
come here, come here.

330
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,649
All right, look, man, I think I
got a plan to get us out of this,

331
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:16,978
but I need you to do the destroying
the bar thing. Can you do that?

332
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:18,086
No problem, I'm a
great destroyer!

333
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,537
Are you kidding me, dude?
You're a born smasher.

334
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:21,202
- Yeah, I'm a born smasher!
- All right, all right.

335
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,966
I'm gonna work a different
angle with the girl.

336
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,552
- Work those pecs.
- Yeah, exactly.

337
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,608
- All right, dude.
- Bump it.

338
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,051
- All right, Dennis...
- What?

339
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,021
I love you.

340
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,011
Go, go, go!

341
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,532
Okay, okay, I got a
plan actually.

342
00:14:32,593 --> 00:14:33,995
I'm gonna start by
wrecking the back

343
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:35,225
office, I don't think
anyone thought of that.

344
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,797
The back office? Charlie, I feel
like there's a lot more stuff...

345
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,132
Listen to me ok? I don't blame you for
that betrayal but you're acting nuts!

346
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,493
All right, listen, I'm sorry
about that whole thing earlier...

347
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:46,007
Shut up, okay? I'm trying
to save your life here, Dee.

348
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,022
Listen, I'm gonna save your life by
wrecking that back office.

349
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,779
We gotta stick together, okay?
You got it?

350
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,045
Yes, I got it, Charlie.

351
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,987
Time's up, assholes!
Start smashing!

352
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,076
I love you.

353
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,993
Said to come in here and take
a break from all the excitement.

354
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,444
It's got me all sweaty.

355
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,320
So sweaty.

356
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:16,132
Do you mind?

357
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:23,024
Margaret, you like sweat, don't you?

358
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,359
It is Margaret, isn't it?
Of course it is.

359
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:29,441
You know, your eyebrow drives me crazy.

360
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:34,822
It's so thick.
It's so... dark, so very...

361
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:37,967
connected.

362
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,385
You're a stone-cold fox,
Margaret.

363
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,348
You're a stone-cold fox and I
want you.

364
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,159
I gotta have you, I need you.
I want you inside me.

365
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,292
But you know that.
Don't you, Margaret?

366
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:57,485
Yeah.

367
00:15:57,894 --> 00:16:00,403
Look at yourself, Dee.
You've turned into a monster.

368
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:02,427
Well, it's not my fault, I'm sick.

369
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,557
I know, Dee.

370
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:06,011
I know, you're the one that first
told us about Stockholm syndrome.

371
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:07,555
But I feel like if you
just snap out of it,

372
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,462
there's a chance that we could
survive this if we just stick together.

373
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,819
- Okay.
- All right, all right! Time's up.

374
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,442
Looks like Mac and
Dennis take it.

375
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:16,735
- Nice! Blast away, boys.
- No!

376
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:17,940
No, wait!

377
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:21,272
Wait, because Charlie...
Charlie destroyed the office.

378
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,728
Come by and look!
Charlie saved my life.

379
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:25,815
- Blast her, blast her.
- Charlie, we did it!

380
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:27,018
We did it.

381
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,625
Goddamn it, Charlie.

382
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:39,540
<i>Frank, Frank! Come in, Frank.</i>

383
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:41,796
When we get out of this,

384
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,856
I'm gonna shove my fist
right into your ass!

385
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,171
Hard and fast.

386
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:50,295
Not in a sexual way, in a
"I am pissed off at you" way...

387
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:53,854
for turning off your walkie-talkie
and leaving me in this shit hole!

388
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,566
Listen to me very
carefully, Frank.

389
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:57,702
Charlie has escaped.
Repeat, Charlie has escaped.

390
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,099
I think he's gonna come
after you, man.

391
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:01,619
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of myself.

392
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:07,052
God, I just stepped in glass! There's
broken bottles all over the place.

393
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,529
Broken bottles everywhere?

394
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,607
Oh, shit, dude.

395
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,993
I think you're in Charlie's bad room.

396
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,316
What the hell is that?

397
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,409
It's where he goes to be
alone and break bottles.

398
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,329
Dude, you got to be real careful.
He's gonna find you.

399
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,371
I can take care of myself.

400
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,548
Hello, Frank.

401
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:25,781
I gotta call you back.

402
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:27,841
<i>Be careful, be careful.</i>

403
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:28,924
Hi, Charlie.

404
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:32,277
Looking for your will, Pop?

405
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,713
That's exactly what
I'm looking for.

406
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,519
You know, it's funny
what kind of men we turn into

407
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,249
in circumstances like this.

408
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,799
I heard who you wanted
to have killed.

409
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,817
That goddamn Mac.

410
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,345
And tell me, Frank...

411
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,061
what do you think about...

412
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,037
this?

413
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:53,807
I liked that very much.

414
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,614
That's exactly why I came up here!

415
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:56,490
No, it's...

416
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,218
Yeah, I guess it is.

417
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,359
No, let's get that out of here.

418
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,809
No, I don't think so, Frank.

419
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:04,430
See, I don't need you
anymore now, do I?

420
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,653
What are you talking about?

421
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,176
What are you doing?
Put your hands down!

422
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,364
Charlie, put your hands down!

423
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:13,177
- Charlie, don't...
- Bye, man!

424
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,382
Oh, my God, you carry that everywhere.
Now, dude, that's ridiculous.

425
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:18,037
- Lead me the hell out of here!
- Fine.

426
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,590
- How?
- This way.

427
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,042
- That way?
- Put that gun down.

428
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:23,422
- I was gonna going that way.
- Well, that would have been all wrong.

429
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:29,425
All right, that was...

430
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,422
nice, that was very...

431
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,449
hot, sweaty and passionate...

432
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:34,352
milky...

433
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,950
Now let's get out of here,
let's... sneak out of here,

434
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:38,836
you know, that's our life together,

435
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,414
let's get out of this
crazy place together,

436
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:41,890
come on, let's go, stick me out!

437
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:43,397
What... no! No, no, no, no, no!

438
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,422
No, without all the kissing part, ok?
That part's over.

439
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:47,726
We're in love now, and you
can stick me out of here.

440
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:48,840
We're at that part now, right?

441
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,315
No, no, no, no!

442
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,446
Please, tell me you understand what
I'm saying. Do you understand me?

443
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,340
Do you understand, or you
don't understand, do you?

444
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:55,510
Oh, God, it is all worth to nothing.

445
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:57,473
What the hell is going on here?

446
00:18:58,814 --> 00:18:59,595
Nothing.

447
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:02,586
It doesn't look like "nothing",
but, for the record, I'm into it.

448
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:06,617
Everybody to the roof...
It's time to pay the piper.

449
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:09,300
Ok, just a couple of hundred more
yards and we're out of here.

450
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,199
A couple of hundred... push hard!

451
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:11,303
That's it, push!

452
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,928
- Go!
- I got a thump, Charlie!

453
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:17,492
I want that you guys go.

454
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:19,652
I... I'm a McPoyle now, so you
wouldn't kill me, right?

455
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:22,504
No, no, she's got Stockholm syndrome!
Don't listen to her, she'll betray you!

456
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,011
I'm the one who won
in the challenge.

457
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:24,997
I'm the one that should live.

458
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:26,719
I see we both won
in the challenge,

459
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:27,997
because we're in the same
team, so we're both safe.

460
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:30,317
I did all the work. You're in the bathroom
getting laid. He was getting laid.

461
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,707
I love inbreeding.

462
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:33,746
I like men and tight white underpants.

463
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,062
- Get on your knees!
- Goddamn it!

464
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,779
We're free, dude, we're free!

465
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,465
Frank and Charlie!

466
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:44,266
Frank and Charlie came to save us!

467
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:48,495
Right?

468
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:56,011
- Uh... yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

469
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:58,943
Yeah, yeah, we came
here to, uh, save you guys.

470
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,010
- Yeah, no, we came to, uh...
- That's exactly it.

471
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,091
- That's why we came.
- save you.

472
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,088
So, here we are.

473
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,965
Frank.

474
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:06,630
Liam.

475
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:09,174
What a delicious surprise.

476
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:13,006
Looks like we got ourselves
into a bit of a pickle here.

477
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:15,952
Get over with your friends.

478
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,469
I don't think so.

479
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:19,515
Really?

480
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,636
Really.

481
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,260
Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon!

482
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:54,801
Brother!

483
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:56,564
God!

484
00:20:58,277 --> 00:20:59,340
I love you!

485
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:00,826
- God, I love you.
- No!

486
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,381
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

487
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:03,445
I got you!

488
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:04,816
I got you, brother.

489
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:07,399
Oh, no, you don't.

490
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:08,905
- What are you doing?
- Ah!

491
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,090
Stop!

492
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,191
Why are you doing that?

493
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:23,711
No!

494
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,848
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

495
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:35,751
I think I might get a
bruise on my heel.

496
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:36,533
That's not bad.

497
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:37,379
No!

498
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,966
It's not really bad at all.
It's pretty fun... it's like, "Ah!"

499
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:41,794
Why don't you guys
climb down that ladder?

500
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:42,794
All right.

501
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:44,104
Later, bitches.

502
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,652
"Later, bitches"? What...

503
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:46,513
So they're just leaving?

504
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:47,727
Wait... why are they leaving?

505
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:48,618
What is happening here?

506
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:49,981
This gun is rubber.

507
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,475
- It's rubber?
- Rubber gun.

508
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,886
She's right, it's rubber.

509
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,042
There's no police!

510
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:55,831
There's no police
down there, dude.

511
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:56,856
What the hell is happening?

512
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:57,783
What is going on here?

513
00:21:57,806 --> 00:21:58,988
What, are they just
screwing with us?

514
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,186
Where are the cops?

515
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:03,522
Revenge! We got you, suckers!

516
00:22:03,544 --> 00:22:05,427
Nobody messes with McPoyles!

517
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,193
McPoyles!

518
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:16,647
Goddamn it!
