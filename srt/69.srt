1
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:06,260
Look what Charlie and I found.

2
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:07,262
Look at this.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,165
Oh, God.
Ah!

4
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:10,432
Get that way from me.
It reeks!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,000
What is that?

6
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:12,703
Dude, this is our mail!
Look at that.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,038
It's our mail and it was in the sewer!

8
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:15,406
What was our
mail doing in the sewer?

9
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,640
I threw it in there.

10
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,144
You turkeys never open it, so I just
started throwing it in the sewer.

11
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:20,745
Why don't you just throw
it into the trash?

12
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,647
Because if I threw it in the
trash, you would find it and

13
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:23,915
then you would yell at me.

14
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,985
Besides, I certainly never expected you
guys to be rooting around in the sewer.

15
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:27,519
Uh, yeah.

16
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:28,486
That brings up another issue.

17
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,455
What are you two doing in the sewer?

18
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,422
We always go in the sewer.

19
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,357
Yeah, we hang out in the sewer.

20
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,092
Why?
Why?

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,959
There's stuff down there.

22
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:37,995
Yeah, I mean, man, don't knock the
sewer till you've tried the sewer.

23
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:39,629
You find all kinds of shit down there.

24
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:40,630
But how are you so clean?

25
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:42,233
We take our clothes off
so we don't get dirty.

26
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,034
You guys!

27
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:45,003
Okay, hang on a second, Dee.
We're getting into something here.

28
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,737
Anything could be down there.

29
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:46,605
It could be big stuff.

30
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,406
Yeah. Rings, coins, nudity.

31
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:48,274
That's all part of the fun.

32
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:49,543
All kinds of stuff.

33
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,712
The two of you are walking
around in the sewers naked,

34
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:52,513
looking for rings and coins?

35
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,814
You feel it with your feet.

36
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:54,815
It's almost like clamming.

37
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:55,984
You mash around with your feet?

38
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:56,684
Okay, but, you guys!

39
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,020
Oh, Dee, would you just knock it off?

40
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,022
I want to know why these two are
rooting around in the sewer...

41
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,458
- My water just broke!
- Drain could... what?

42
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,594
I'm having a baby.

43
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:07,175
 

44
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,775
 

45
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,065
Out of my way.

46
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,066
I've broken my water.

47
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,001
There's a baby inside of
me running out of water!

48
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,335
Dennis, that was amazing, dude.

49
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,737
I've never seen anybody
drive that fast.

50
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,571
You hit 120, 120!

51
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,572
I almost stewed my drawers.

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,474
She was screaming in my ear the
whole time, probably screwed

53
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,341
my transmission up.

54
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:51,809
Nice and easy, here we go.
Oh, yes.

55
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:52,777
This is my ride.

56
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:53,778
They've done this before.

57
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:54,778
Thank you. All done with you.

58
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:56,846
You can go.

59
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,047
Hold on a second.
Where's the guy?

60
00:01:58,115 --> 00:01:59,382
Should we call the guy?
Get the guy down here?

61
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,883
The guy.

62
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,851
The guy who...
Oh, no, no. That guy.

63
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,029
There's no guy.
What do you mean, there's no guy?

64
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,523
There's no guy.
It's complicated.

65
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,124
There's got to be a guy.
We'll go get the guy!

66
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,859
We'll get the dad!
There's no guy, okay?

67
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,995
Why don't you guys do what you
do best and don't care, okay?

68
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:10,730
I got it from here.

69
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,565
We can take it from
here, right, Michael?

70
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,165
Yeah.

71
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,167
Yeah, Michael and I got it.

72
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,335
Thanks, guys.

73
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,336
All right.

74
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,573
Kind of rude, but, uh, I guess if we're
off the hook, let's head back to the bar.

75
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,509
Yeah.
Yeah, I could get blitzed.

76
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:22,676
No, no, no. Wait.
Stop, guys.

77
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,278
No, this is not right.
Something is not right here.

78
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,014
This is very suspicious.
Why?

79
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,949
There's no guy in the picture?
So what?

80
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,117
Well, you know what this means, right?

81
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:29,884
There's no dad in the picture.

82
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:32,453
That means the brunt of the responsibility
of this kid is going to fall on us.

83
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,788
We're going to have to do everything.

84
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,557
Oh.
You're right.

85
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:38,126
Dee is, like, the most irresponsible
person on the planet.

86
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:40,061
I mean, look what she was doing
with the mail, for Christ sakes!

87
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:40,828
Oh, my God!

88
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,230
We're going to be in
charge of the kid?

89
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:43,931
No, this kid cannot become
our responsibility.

90
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,899
I mean, look what this
kid has ruined already.

91
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:46,834
He's ruined my transmission.

92
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,736
He's ruined a perfectly
good sewer conversation.

93
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,138
I still want to get to
the bottom of that one.

94
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:51,639
What the hell?
We will.

95
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,174
God knows what he's going
to ruin in the future.

96
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:55,176
He is going to ruin everything!

97
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,176
We got to find the dad!

98
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,545
We got to find that dad!
You're right.

99
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:58,980
We should find the dad.
Let's find the dad.

100
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,348
The dad's responsible.
Let's find the dad.

101
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,583
Let's find the dad.
Okay.

102
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,351
I wonder if the dad even knows.

103
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll bet she's embarrassed.

104
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:07,656
Too embarrassed to tell us because
she's bedded some real stinkers.

105
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:10,326
You know what?
She might not even know, herself.

106
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,061
No, well, there's always overlap.

107
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,831
Any multiple number of-of sperms could
have gone up there and eaten the egg.

108
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:15,832
There could be so many dads.

109
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,434
No, sperm doesn't eat the egg.

110
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,370
It doesn't eat the egg and
grow strong and become a baby?

111
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,772
By the way, she's pregnant and
it's a guy, so let's get him.

112
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,373
Let's find the guy.

113
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:23,975
Why don't we just round up
the usual suspects, and then

114
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,944
we'll figure out how many of them...
Somebody's got to stay here with her.

115
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,379
Oh, you think so?
You're right, you're right.

116
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:31,282
It should be...
Oh, it looks like it's going to be you.

117
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,449
Why? What happened?

118
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:35,286
Well, mostly because, you know, we're
all on this side and you're over there.

119
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,286
What?

120
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:37,655
Just because you guys
made it to one side?

121
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:39,156
You didn't make it
to the side on time.

122
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:41,492
Also, now we're backing out, and
you're kind of stuck there.

123
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,127
I can back out.
Hey, we'll find the dad.

124
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,061
You better find that dad.

125
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,662
This is not fair.

126
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,664
Just keep your eye on her.

127
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:54,570
What-what are you doing?

128
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:55,571
What-what are you doing?

129
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,106
Get down!
No.

130
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:57,974
I'm trying to make the tv go.

131
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,976
You are standing on top
of a rolling chair.

132
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,978
You're going to go flying through
that window for God sakes.

133
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,446
Will you get down?
I'm serious.

134
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:04,180
You get down, Dee.

135
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:05,681
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

136
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,250
I know, I know.
What are you thinking?

137
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,885
Well, I'm trying to
watch my stories, okay?

138
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:11,454
I have a very specific birth
plan and mostly it involves me

139
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:15,191
watching my stories to relax, but I can't
get this goddamn tv to do anything.

140
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:18,027
What are you... are you...
Knock it off!

141
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:19,628
I'm mad at the...
Stop straining yourself.

142
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:20,963
Go lie down.
Lie down now.

143
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,365
God, this is exactly what
I was worried about, Dee.

144
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,368
You see, I am going to have to
do everything because you are

145
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:29,271
an irresponsible person who
stands atop rolling chairs and

146
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,039
chooses to go flying through windows.

147
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:32,340
Have the baby first.

148
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:35,076
Have the stupid baby, then go flying
through all the windows you like.

149
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,710
Oh, my...
Just lie there.

150
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:37,644
Wait for the doctor.

151
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,346
I will get your stories.

152
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,882
God, this baby is becoming such
an irritating thing to me.

153
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,716
Yeah.

154
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,884
God, what an irritating
thing babies are.

155
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,619
Oh my goodness.

156
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:52,224
I'll figure you out,
you son of a bitch.

157
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,797
What is going on?
Where is everybody?

158
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,131
I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

159
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,666
They'll be here.
You're early.

160
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,034
Do you have anything to drink?

161
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,303
The salt on the chips
dries out my mouth.

162
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,573
I'll poke around the fridge
and see if there's anything.

163
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,509
Where's the beer?
I forgot the beer.

164
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,077
I'm sorry.
You didn't bring the beer?

165
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:12,647
How are we supposed to know this
is a party if there's no beer?

166
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:14,115
Well, I got wrapped up
in the invitations.

167
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:15,016
It's a party with no beer.

168
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,952
We don't want them thinking
it's an interrogation.

169
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,387
Well, you give him a glass of water.

170
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:19,688
Oh, hey.

171
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:20,689
Party, party!

172
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:21,657
All right. Hey!

173
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,459
Hey, crick.
Ooh.

174
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:24,893
Where the booze at?
What's up, fellas?

175
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:25,994
Hey.

176
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:26,962
Who invited cricket?

177
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,031
I did, because I figured
it's a wild card.

178
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,567
That's a stone you can leave unturned. I mean...
We don't have time for that bullshit.

179
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:32,968
We got to get on this, all right?

180
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:33,869
Let's just pick one and go.

181
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:34,903
Hey, uh, bill?

182
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,506
Can we talk to you for a sec,
maybe, uh, in this room?

183
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:38,707
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

184
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,342
Let's do this.
A little guy time.

185
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,743
All right.
Guy time.

186
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,445
Right, let's turn it up.

187
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:45,179
Whoo!

188
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,215
Let's get weird, buddy.
Let's get weird.

189
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:48,749
Thanks for coming to the party, bill.

190
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,084
Thanks for having me, guys, you know?

191
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:52,587
It's good to get away from the wife
and kids for a little bit, you know?

192
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:53,387
Let the hair down.

193
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:55,957
So you're still with your wife
after all that shit with Dee?

194
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,426
Yeah, well, I realized
I was a sex addict.

195
00:05:58,494 --> 00:05:59,694
I went to therapy.

196
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:00,962
She forgave me for it.

197
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,431
Oh, you're a sex addict, huh?

198
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:06,100
That's crazy to be one of those.

199
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:07,802
Yeah, you don't mind if I write
some of this down, do you?

200
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,603
For what?

201
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:09,871
Just keeping a log of the party.

202
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,139
We like to do that.
Oh.

203
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,274
Yeah, you know, a funny conversation
pops up, you want to remember it.

204
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:13,908
No problem.

205
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:17,045
Speaking of parties, you guys
want to do a little...

206
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:17,545
Is that coke?

207
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,580
Yeah, yeah, I picked up a
couple grams on the way over.

208
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:20,181
Come on.

209
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,651
Yeah, maybe a little bit
later, we can all partake.

210
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:25,787
But for now, you know, we're just-just
a bunch of guys hanging out in a room.

211
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:26,688
You know, dudes.

212
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,423
Let's talk about dude stuff.

213
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,925
I like dude stuff, yeah.
Like what?

214
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:30,892
Oh, I don't know.

215
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,627
Let's think about, like, uh,
what do guys talk about?

216
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:33,628
Condoms!

217
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:34,629
Right.

218
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:36,298
I cannot stand the feel
of a condom on my dick.

219
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:37,299
Oh my God.
I hate condoms.

220
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,734
Hate 'em, hate 'em,
hate 'em, hate 'em.

221
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:39,234
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:40,702
I mean, the three of
us just don't use 'em.

223
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,770
No.
How about you?

224
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:43,806
No, me neither.
No, I can't stand them.

225
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:44,907
Well, that's interesting.

226
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,343
A sex addict who doesn't like condoms.

227
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,546
That's why I had a vasectomy, guys.

228
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:51,547
You had a vasectomy?

229
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:52,848
Yep.

230
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:54,817
You just winked when you said that.

231
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:56,318
Did you have a vasectomy or not?

232
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:57,319
No.

233
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:02,780
But that's what I would tell the ladies,
so I didn't have to wear a condom.

234
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,807
Oh, man!

235
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:06,768
That is incredibly shady.

236
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:07,768
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

237
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,770
What a beautiful underhanded thing.

238
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:10,771
Yeah.

239
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,773
It's disgusting.
Very underhanded.

240
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,330
- You guys want to do a bump or what?
- I'll have a bump.

241
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,273
I don't understand why there's not
a single room in this hospital...

242
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:20,904
Well, I don't know where...
That has a working television.

243
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,477
I want it, I want that
room, I want it now.

244
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:23,977
I don't know where you think
I'm gonna get it from.

245
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:25,031
I don't have any.

246
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:29,165
If you do not get my sister
her stories and a new room as

247
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:32,817
soon as possible, then I will
come down on this hospital like

248
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:34,555
the hammer of Thor.

249
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:38,245
The thunder of my vengeance will
echo through these corridors

250
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,417
like the dust of a thousand winds!

251
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:44,686
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

252
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,665
I ain't going to jail over you.

253
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,901
I will beat your ass and
think nothing of it.

254
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,903
I'm not doing this with you today.

255
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,004
I'm not. I'm not!

256
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,768
What's the word on my stories?

257
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,740
What are you doing?

258
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:57,608
Why are you not in bed?

259
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,476
Oh, I slipped out for a
quick sandwich and a soda.

260
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:00,377
You left the hospital?

261
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:01,211
Yeah, I was kind of hungry.

262
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,046
Mostly, I was just getting bored.

263
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,047
You know what I mean...?

264
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,048
Dee, get in your room!

265
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:06,883
You're drive... I-I...
It's so boring.

266
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:09,203
- There's nothing going on in there.
- You get in your room. You get in your room!

267
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,601
Get in here. Get in there.

268
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,494
The lighting, and don't push me, though,
because I'm pregnant, and I don't...

269
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,393
Get in the bed. Get in bed.
Wait a sec. What's this?

270
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,132
What? I don't know.

271
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,157
Why is there a strange man in my room?

272
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:17,926
They probably slid this man in
here, thinking that you were

273
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,420
never gonna use the room, so...
Well, that's no good.

274
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,519
I don't want there to be a strange man
laying in my room who looks dead.

275
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,749
Is he dead? Dennis, is he dead?

276
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,237
I'm sure he's just sleeping, Dee.

277
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:27,117
Get-get in bed.

278
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,333
I'm gonna scream his face
and see if he wakes up.

279
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:29,533
Do not scream in the man's face.

280
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,845
I'll jiggle his ankle, and that will
determine whether he's alive or not.

281
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,534
Excuse me, sir, are you...?
Well, you're very cold.

282
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:37,598
He's very cold. Okay.
Hey! Hey, you!

283
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,478
You, wake up right now
if you're not dead.

284
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,381
All right, damn it, Dee, stop.
Oh, God, I think he's dead.

285
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:42,406
Yeah. Yeah.
I think he's dead, Dennis.

286
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,414
He's definitely dead.
Oh, why would they do that?

287
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:47,518
Why would they put a dead old
man with paper skin in my room

288
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:48,990
when I'm trying to give birth?

289
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:49,741
I don't know.

290
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,598
Because you weren't using the room,
Dee, and the hospital is very full.

291
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:53,004
Oh, okay, well, this was
not part of my birth plan.

292
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:55,172
This was not part of
my birth plan, sir.

293
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,270
Get the nurse.
Get the nurse and get him out.

294
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,998
Get him out of here.

295
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:58,909
Getting the nurse is not
going to do any good.

296
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,934
That woman is stubborn as shit.
Well, do something.

297
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:02,597
You ought to do something,
'cause this is upsetting me.

298
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:03,726
All right! All right!
And it's upsetting the baby.

299
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,870
I hate all the responsibility that I
have that this baby is causing me.

300
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,678
Yes, I will get this man out of your
room; I will think of something awesome.

301
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,125
Listen, so things got pretty
hot and heavy with you and Dee

302
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:17,310
back in the day, correct?

303
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,606
That was over a year ago?

304
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,292
Yeah. Yeah, she wasn't
very nice to me.

305
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:21,518
So, what are we looking at?

306
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:24,541
No contact with Dee after you dated,
or what's the deal here, bud?

307
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:28,517
Well, no. She, um...
She contacted me for a while.

308
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,910
Usually when she was drunk.

309
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,429
Drunken late-night booty calls?

310
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:38,693
No. She usually just yells at me, calls
me names, like army, camo turkey.

311
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,790
I know she's just drunk, so it's okay.

312
00:09:42,053 --> 00:09:43,381
Not okay. Not okay at all.

313
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:44,669
You got to stand up for yourself, man.

314
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:45,805
So, you haven't slept with her then?

315
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:47,702
Uh, sometimes she tricks me.

316
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,005
She tricks you?

317
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,070
She tricks you how?

318
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:54,942
To give her sex.

319
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,054
She's a very manipulative person.

320
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,638
Well, I-I'm sorry.

321
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:08,070
Are you guys mad at me?

322
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:14,182
No, man, we're not mad...
No. I mean... you know... okay.

323
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,120
Get a grip, but...
Yeah.

324
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,172
Really?

325
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,853
Yeah. Uh, there's a room full of dudes
out there, so you might want to... yeah.

326
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,581
Stop crying...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:21,781
Before you come back out to the party.

328
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,541
Pull it together, because,
you know, you're a soldier,

329
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,342
and you should be tougher.

330
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,821
Let's go.

331
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:28,420
Thanks, guys.

332
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:29,950
This is the guy who's
defending our country?

333
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:31,477
Well, he's definitely a candidate.

334
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,614
Oh, boys, the keg has arrived!

335
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,783
Hey, Frank, this power outlet
is gonna explode, and you're

336
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:38,469
gonna have to deal with that, okay?

337
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,661
Duncan, go with it, baby.

338
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:41,662
Yeah, let's go for it.

339
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,581
Go for it.

340
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:43,796
Yeah.

341
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,598
Yo, Frank, we gonna set it off, bitch.

342
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,950
What are your bridge
friends doing here?

343
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,461
Well, you got to give it
the illusion of a party.

344
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,493
It's got to be a guy's
night, that's why.

345
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:54,046
Are you high on blow?

346
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:56,198
Whatever Duncan gave me.

347
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,837
You don't even know
what you're high on?

348
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:58,454
No.

349
00:10:58,588 --> 00:10:59,374
Hey!

350
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,742
Yo, Charlie chuckles,
what's cracking, sunshine? Yeah.

351
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:03,461
Hey.

352
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,421
Hello, Kev.

353
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,292
Little Kev.

354
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,702
And you here.

355
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:09,013
Ah.
I'll talk to you guys later.

356
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:10,877
Okay. Okay.

357
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,332
What is little Kev doing here?

358
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,806
Ell, you got to throw out a big net to
catch the fish that she was banging.

359
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,125
Party!

360
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:22,861
It's a party, yo.

361
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,510
Is that the bus boy from
the Korean restaurant?

362
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:25,854
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:26,877
She banged him.

364
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,379
<i>Now, are you sure we're not taking
this weekend at Bernie's</i>

365
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,326
<i>thing too far?</i>

366
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:36,997
<i>'Cause I'm worried the
sunglasses are ridiculous.</i>

367
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,381
<i>No. The sunglasses
lighten the mood.</i>

368
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:39,062
<i>Yeah.</i>

369
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,916
<i>Make the whole thing feel like
a fun, fun romp, you know?</i>

370
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:41,518
<i>Hi.</i>

371
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,357
<i>Hi, ladies. Hi. Yeah.</i>

372
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:43,454
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

373
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,958
<i>Without the sunglasses, weekend
at Bernie's would have been very dark.</i>

374
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,957
Yeah. Strange movie.

375
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:47,694
Very strange tale.

376
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:48,302
Yeah.

377
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:49,150
Hey there, Mr. Craig.

378
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:55,134
Okay. Okay, the waving thing's
awesome, that's true, yeah.

379
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:55,950
Yeah, it's pretty sweet, right...?

380
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,509
Yeah.

381
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:57,501
Okay, now, what's our plan here?

382
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:59,813
Are we just gonna throw him in
the trash, or are we gonna find,

383
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:02,062
like, a laundry shoot, fire him
down that, or what are we doing?

384
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,606
What? No.

385
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,565
Just gonna drop him in one of these
rooms if I can find an empty one.

386
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:07,062
No, but that way, somebody could find
him and put him back in my room.

387
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,022
That's a good point.

388
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,141
Or maybe we could stuff him in a
drawer, or, like, jam him in a

389
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:10,853
closet or something.

390
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:11,726
That'll buy us some time, right?

391
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,053
Mm-hmm. Makes me feel
like I have to touch him.

392
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,030
I don't want to touch him at all, so why
don't we just put him in the trash?

393
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,117
- Well...
- Please don't put me in the trash!

394
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,406
Oh, are you alive?

395
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:21,045
Oh, my goodness.

396
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:23,118
Whoa! What is going on here?

397
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:24,101
What are you doing with Mr.

398
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:24,813
Craig?

399
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,494
They're trying to put me in the trash.

400
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:27,903
Don't... no. Don't you...
Okay, you know what?

401
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,558
I flat-out refuse to share a
room with an old man who likes

402
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:31,540
to pretend to be dead.

403
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:32,158
He's a liar.

404
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:34,004
You are not allowed
to move the patients.

405
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:35,406
What? What?

406
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,781
Oh, Dennis. Oh, my God.

407
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:37,766
What?

408
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,261
Oh, I think I'm having this baby.
Ugh!

409
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:39,909
Doctor!

410
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,197
Oh, it doesn't feel good.

411
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:41,853
This sucks.

412
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,253
This sucks a bag of dicks.

413
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,973
Oh, I'm sure.

414
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:45,062
Oh, man! Oh!

415
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,197
Listen, help my sister.
Help my sister.

416
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:47,973
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't leave me. I don't like it.

417
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:49,669
Okay. No, I'm coming.
We got you from here.

418
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:50,598
I'm coming with you.
We got you.

419
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:51,734
You ain't going nowhere.

420
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:55,230
You get your narrow ass back in that
waiting room before I knock you in there.

421
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,662
You have done enough today.

422
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,445
Crazy ass white boy steadily dressing
up folk and talking about Thor... oh.

423
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,982
I got you.

424
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:07,694
Wow. You know, this whole
thing's really setting in now.

425
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:10,269
Yeah, it's really sinking in, man.

426
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,438
We're gonna have a baby.

427
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,398
This is really cool.

428
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:14,998
Please don't throw me in the trash.

429
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,836
No one's putting you in the trash.

430
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,614
Stop saying that.

431
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:17,341
Will you stop?

432
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:23,910
Man, I used to have some
Jean shorts like that, too.

433
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,582
I slept in them shits, man.

434
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,886
Eventually, I blew the crotch
out of them things, but you

435
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:32,638
can't wear 'em every day and
expect for 'em to hold up.

436
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,317
That was some nice ass denim, too.

437
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,876
I miss those shorts.

438
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:40,558
But you-you got to take 'em
off every now and then.

439
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:43,005
Got to take 'em off, son.

440
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:44,470
So, I don't get it.

441
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,557
Why are you having sex with her?

442
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:48,470
Well, she gets drunk and
calls me a cardio-jerk or a

443
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:51,230
workout turkey, and after a
while I just kind of cave in.

444
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:54,142
Wow, you just...
All right, I got to try that with someone.

445
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:54,830
Thanks, Rex.

446
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,125
Okay, thank you. Thanks, Rex.

447
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:56,773
Enjoy the party.

448
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,269
She's just berating these guys
into having sex with her.

449
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,246
Yeah, and she is slammin'
ass all over town.

450
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,917
She's getting way more action than us.

451
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,813
She's stu on her curse words...
"Jerk" and "turkey" are all that she's using.

452
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,262
Yeah, well, clearly they're working
for her, 'cause Rex is a quality lay.

453
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:10,909
Yeah, re... all right, well, he's
not to fit to be a father, though.

454
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,926
A father? No. None of these
guys are fit to be fathers.

455
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,054
I mean, look at them, they're animals.

456
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,438
Even if we do figure out who it
is, how are we gonna trust this

457
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,694
baby with one of these monkeys?

458
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,222
No, look at them, they're animals...
They got no self-control.

459
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:25,142
You know, it takes discipline
to raise a kid, you know?

460
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,044
You got to set rules, you
got to set ground rules.

461
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,070
Set some boundaries.

462
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:31,510
You know, like, um, don't have
'em, like, doing cocaine, uh,

463
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,285
get them off the Internet, you know?

464
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,886
Yeah, oh, the Internet is a
very, very dangerous place.

465
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,111
Kids spend all their
time on the Internet.

466
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,198
Hi. Who are you.

467
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,342
Oh, there's your penis
and there's your butt.

468
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:40,958
You got to learn from someone books...
Give 'em some books.

469
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,854
Well, reading too many books...
Well, you don't want 'em to be a nerd.

470
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:44,854
You don't want 'em to be a nerd.

471
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,278
I am not raising a nerd, bro!

472
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:47,733
If it's a nerd, I'm
gonna bash his head in.

473
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,198
Nerds get nowhere in life.

474
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,270
Oh, my God, is he a nerd?

475
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,876
I could bash some nerds right now.

476
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:53,838
Well, right after this we
should probably bash nerds.

477
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,997
I got to get it out of my system.

478
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,342
Bash some nerds.

479
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,173
Absolutely.

480
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:00,572
Do you know what, you got to
teach him how to beat nerds up.

481
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,915
He's got to be beating nerds up.

482
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,940
I feel we have a lot of
ideas about raising a kid.

483
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:07,627
We are men who can be great
dads, we have great opinions...

484
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,212
Yeah, and that's all
that parenting is.

485
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,251
Pretending you know what you're
talking about and then jamming

486
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,276
it down a kid's throat.

487
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:14,557
Oh, my God, that's
what we're gonna do.

488
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,845
When I see that baby, dude,
we're gonna run towards it, I'm

489
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,486
gonna grab it, I'm gonna pick him up...
And jam shit down his throat!

490
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,125
Dude.

491
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:20,917
Dude, we're gonna be the dad.

492
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,997
We're so much better
dads than these guys.

493
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:23,853
I mean, look.

494
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,861
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh...

495
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:35,758
I can't wait to tell him.

496
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,774
I can't believe this.

497
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:37,453
This is so exciting.

498
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:38,629
There he is.

499
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:41,034
Hey, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, we
have news, we have wonderful news.

500
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:45,470
Charlie and I have decided that we are
going to be the father of this child.

501
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,974
Dude, we did a complete 180.

502
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,700
You know what, you guys,
I did a 180, too.

503
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:49,365
I totally did.

504
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,157
I was all pissy this morning
about how I'm gonna be at the

505
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,206
hospital, and then I was
thinking about it, and I

506
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,765
realized I've been firing on all
cylinders because of this baby thing.

507
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:59,270
<i>Dude, I did this weekend at
Bernie's operation earlier that</i>

508
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,437
would have blown you guys' mind...
It was very effective.

509
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,206
And then I busted out this
"sweet Thor" line on this lady,

510
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:05,407
'cause she was pissing me off,
and it was, like, boom!

511
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:07,798
I mean, I really hit her with it...
And I never reference the nordic gods.

512
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:08,926
What are you saying, though?

513
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,950
'Cause I don't understand
what your point is.

514
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,574
I'm saying I want to be the dad, too...
I'm totally into it.

515
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,511
Okay.

516
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,743
Well, that steps on our thing a little bit, but...
Yeah, 'cause we were doing

517
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,518
<i>the... you know, maybe instead of doing
a my two dads type thing,</i>

518
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:22,182
<i>we could fold in another dad and do a
three men and a baby type situation.</i>

519
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,774
<i>Three men and a baby...
That's what it is. I like that.</i>

520
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:25,126
An equally effective movie, right?
A great movie.

521
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,919
Did we miss it?
Did we miss it?

522
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,088
No. It was...
What's going on?

523
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:29,974
Who are all these people?

524
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:32,862
Oh! I couldn't decide who the dad
was, so I brought everybody.

525
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:35,590
You didn't even try and decide who
the dad was, you just got high!

526
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,950
Well, the interrogation
did turn into a coke party.

527
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,022
But they all promised
to have blood tests.

528
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,254
Uh! If this kid is mine, I'm
gonna blow my brains out.

529
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,189
Ah. Oh, he got zooted, man.

530
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:47,887
He took an eight-ball to the dome.

531
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,886
No, no, Frank, dude, get these
guys out of here, all right?

532
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:53,446
<i>We're gonna be the
father of the baby now.</i>

533
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,502
Yes, we're gonna be the fathers.

534
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:55,942
It has been decided.
So sayeth Thor.

535
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:57,269
Thor said it.
Tho-who?

536
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,702
Thor.
Who Thor?

537
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,174
Is that your Greek God reference?

538
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,294
He's a nordic God.
Nordic God.

539
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,542
No, I said something else earlier that
was it sounded a lot cooler than that.

540
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,006
Yeah.
That one didn't really work.

541
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:07,422
Guys! Guys, here she comes.
She's coming.

542
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,278
How do we make it a big moment?

543
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,614
I want to make it a
big moment, you know?

544
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,326
With music!

545
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:12,942
Duncan, play something special.

546
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:13,910
Frank, I got the perfect thing.

547
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:43,750
♪ Ah, ha, ooh... ooh, ooh ah, ha, ah...
♪ ooh... ah, ha, ah... ooh, ooh..

548
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:56,806

this woman's work ♪ this woman's world

549
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:09,110

550

551
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:20,638
I know you have a lot... ♪

552
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:21,559
Carmen?

553
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:22,510
What are you doing here?

554
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:24,158
I'm here to get my baby.

555
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:25,110
What?

556
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,910
Oh, yeah, the tranny's the dad.

557
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:31,663
You had sex with a tranny?

558
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:33,446
No.
No, I was their surrogate.

559
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,470
We used, uh, her sperm and a
donor egg, and then they just

560
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,894
kind of... Right up there and...
We had a difficult time

561
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,463
finding a surrogate, but Dee
here was a miracle to us.

562
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,806
See, I can't have kids of my
and Carmen always wanted...

563
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,766
Yeah, yeah, great, great, miracle for you.
How wonderful.

564
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,174
Dee, you tricked us?

565
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:48,031
How did I trick you?

566
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:50,358
Well, we were getting all pumped
up about being this baby's dad.

567
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,902
We were all keyed up for nothing.

568
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,558
Yeah. If we knew you were
doing this stupid surrogate

569
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,926
thing again, we would have just
completely ignored your pregnancy.

570
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:58,005
<i>You did ignore my pregnancy!</i>

571
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,576
This has been a huge
disappointment for us.

572
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:01,375
Why?

573
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:02,486
We were gonna be great dads.

574
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,311
We were gonna impose
our will on the kid.

575
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,680
<i>We had a three men and a baby
thing going on!</i>

576
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:07,965
<i>Oh, okay, I'm sorry.</i>

577
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,326
<i>I have to admit, this whole
thing might be for the best.</i>

578
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:12,279
<i>I mean, those two are gonna make
great parents, much better</i>

579
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:14,476
<i>parents than any of us
would, don't you think?</i>

580
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,734
<i>Yeah. I guess.</i>

581
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,806
<i>You know, a baby would've screwed
up our chemistry, right?</i>

582
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,510
<i>It might've.</i>

583
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:21,343
<i>It might've, yeah, yeah.</i>

584
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,190
<i>Yeah, we got a good thing going...
Why blow it with a baby?</i>

585
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,877
<i>Yeah, that being said, don't get
knocked up anymore, Dee...</i>

586
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:26,679
<i>It's getting old.</i>

587
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,214
<i>Oh, yeah, no, no, I
didn't enjoy any of it.</i>

588
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,773
<i>So, what I'm confused on is, the
mother is the father and the</i>

589
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,830
<i>father is black and the
baby's not black, so...</i>

590
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,088
<i>It's all been explained.</i>

591
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:37,750
<i>Yes.</i>

592
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,246
<i>I'll talk you through it later.</i>

593
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:39,854
<i>All right.</i>

594
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:40,645
<i>Then what is your deal?</i>

595
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,974
<i>Do we pop you back in there, or
are you done having babies, or</i>

596
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:44,823
<i>what's going on ...
Yeah, can you take me to go get a beer?</i>

597
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:45,567
<i>'Cause I need a beer.</i>

598
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,775
<i>Ooh, cool, I could
go for a beer.</i>

599
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:47,735
<i>You guys want to go
back to the bar?</i>

600
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,510
<i>Yeah!</i>

601
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,798
<i>Hey, you guys, let's bring
the party back to the bar.</i>

602
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,462
<i>Bring the music. Let's go.</i>

603
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:54,454
<i>What the hell's
happening back there?</i>

604
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:55,294
<i>A few buddies came along.</i>

605
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,230
<i>Don't worry about it, Dee.</i>

606
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,822
<i>Oh! Let's party in the sewer!</i>

607
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,135
<i>Oh, yeah, Charlie!</i>

608
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,229
<i>I'm not going into a sewer.</i>

609
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:01,981
<i>What is your obsession with
the sewer these days?</i>

610
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,254
<i>You find a lot of great
stuff down there.</i>

611
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:04,382
<i>Like what?
Like sewage.</i>

612
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,655
<i>Ha-ha! Good gone, Dee!</i>

613
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,254
<i>She's back, baby, she's back!</i>

614
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:09,645
<i>No, no, suppose there's a storm
and a guy loses his ring...</i>

615
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,879
<i>Oh, my God, is this the
ring story again?</i>

616
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:11,870
<i>I'm getting real tired
of the ring story.</i>

617
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:13,806
<i>You got to come up with
something else, Frank.</i>

618
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,630
<i>You can't keep using the same...
