1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:04,020
_

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,936
Uh, guys,
I-I'd like to raise a glass to Frank.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,765
Frank, another year has gone
by since you came into my life.

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,203
I don't see any blue on this menu.

5
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,118
- Well, hang on. Don't interrupt.
- Why do you want to eat blue?

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,207
- The best foods are blue.
- Charlie,

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,643
let's just order, shall we?

8
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,210
Now, Dennis,
what will I be having this evening?

9
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,299
- Oh, come on.
- Well, I don't want to just order, okay?

10
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:22,561
I'm trying to say
some nice words here, okay?

11
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:24,519
- About what?
- About you, man.

12
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,521
Oh, God. You people.

13
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,219
Ugh, this guy again.

14
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,177
Come on, man. What are you doing here?
This isn't Guigino's.

15
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,309
Yeah, I thought you moved.

16
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:34,355
I moved back.
So... Wait, you guys remember me?

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,922
Uh, yeah, you're everywhere.

18
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:37,358
Yeah. We can't get away from you.

19
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,143
You know what? Doesn't matter.

20
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,275
What's in them little bowls?
Blue, I hope.

21
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,885
I... Bl...

22
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,584
No, i-it's amuse-bouche for the table.

23
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:47,020
- What is it?
- We didn't order yet, pal.

24
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,283
Again, Dennis, what am I having?

25
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:51,981
- Stop asking me that.
- I'm not paying for those, pal.

26
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,244
They're compliments from the chef.

27
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,984
We don't want compliments, we want food.

28
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:57,465
If I wanted a compliment,
I'd walk into a bar.

29
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,771
Oh, Dee. God.

30
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:00,468
- Dee, shut up.
- Yeah, Dennis, do you want me

31
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:02,122
to throw my glass of water in her face?

32
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,471
Well, don't ask. Just do.

33
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:05,256
Well, h-hang on a second, dude.
You don't chew no good anymore.

34
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,780
- You want me to chew that up for you?
- I don't want that.

35
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:09,173
Well, you haven't had your
teeth sharpened in a bit.

36
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:11,349
- I better chew it.
- He gets his teeth sharpened?

37
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:13,786
Not as often as he should. No. Uh...

38
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,833
What's this?

39
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,400
I think he's choking.

40
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,837
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, he can't get air.

41
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,797
Yeah.

42
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:36,374
Hmm.

43
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:44,077
Okay, folks,
we have a few specials tonight.

44
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,079
Oh, my God!

45
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,660
_

46
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,118
- That's it! Yeah, I'm absolutely having a fit!
- All night long?

47
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:26,337
- Look, I-I'm sorry, okay?
- I'm having a fit. That's right.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,816
I don't know what happened.
I froze up, all right?

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,253
- Oh, yeah. You froze up.
- May-Maybe I thought

50
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,645
- that's how you wanted to go out, Frank.
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,212
That's how I wanted to go? Me?

52
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,345
I don't know!
I don't know how you want to die.

53
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,998
You only ever talk about
how you don't want to die,

54
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:38,653
like in a hospital bed
or getting spit-roasted

55
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,699
- by two Latin King gang members in prison.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,048
Okay, look, at least here,

57
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,223
you're in a fancy restaurant, right?

58
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,312
- You're surrounded by your friends.
- Oh, my friends.

59
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:47,227
Who are watching me choke to death

60
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:49,621
- with pleasure in their eyes.
- Nobody had pleasure! Okay,

61
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,231
- maybe I was a little mad at you, all right?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:52,363
Y-You didn't let me finish my speech.

63
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,842
You kept interrupting me
about anything that's blue

64
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,453
- on the menu, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.

65
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:57,281
You didn't let me chew
your food for you. You know, you...

66
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:58,499
Oh, well, you're not gonna
be able to do that, either.

67
00:02:58,543 --> 00:02:59,892
No more chewing my food.

68
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:01,154
You mash it too thin.

69
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,938
You take all the flavor out of it.

70
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,289
- You get all the nutrients. I get all the mush.
- You...

71
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,247
- Do you think I want to chew your food?
- Yeah, you...

72
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,423
Well, you don't have to do that anymore,
because I'm going.

73
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,164
- Where are you gonna go?
- I'm going

74
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,819
- to the one person who actually cares about me.
- All right.

75
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,690
Good. You know what, fine, go.

76
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,039
Get out of here. I don't care.

77
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,303
I'll go back to being me.
You know, young and cool

78
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,870
before I started chewing the
food of some crazy old man.

79
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:24,612
You know, I used to do cool shit, Frank!

80
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,832
I used to be cool!

81
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,877
I'm cool.

82
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,712
That was an interesting evening.

83
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:40,324
Yeah. Yeah, it was. Frank was pissed.

84
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,629
I would've stepped in,

85
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,370
but, of course,
I was taking my cues from you.

86
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,981
Why?

87
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,419
Well, you didn't tell me
whether I should save him or not.

88
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,203
But why? I mean, wh...

89
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,336
why do I still have to
tell you what to do?

90
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,773
Why do I still have to
order your dinners for you?

91
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:56,514
And why is it up to me to decide

92
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:59,168
whether or not you're
going to save a man's life?

93
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:00,300
You know what the problem is?

94
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:03,477
I can't depend on you.
I can't depend on anyone.

95
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,871
You know, I mean,
if that had been me choking tonight...

96
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,568
- no one would've saved me.
- No.

97
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:10,088
I-I would've saved you, Dennis.
I would have saved you.

98
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:13,574
- If you told me to.
- Oh, Jesus Christ... if I told you to?

99
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:14,749
Oh!

100
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:17,665
♪ Pizza man, pizza man ♪

101
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,102
♪ I got pizza here,
who wants pizza man? ♪

102
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,366
What are you doing here, man?
It's, like, after midnight.

103
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,368
Uh, after midnight?
What are you, like, in your 40s?

104
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,804
- Yeah. As are you.
- Yeah.

105
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:28,676
- Have a slice. Let's get into it, boys.
- No! No.

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,462
Dennis cannot eat cheese,
because cheese is poison.

107
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,551
- No dairy for this guy.
- That's actually correct.

108
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:35,596
Oh. It's all good, though.
I actually ate all the cheese

109
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,381
on the walk over, so... no cheese!

110
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,817
Oh! That solves it. Dennis will have

111
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,688
- the crust and the sauce, then.
- No, Mac.

112
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,603
Not gonna have the
crust. Are you insane?

113
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,475
I mean, you know, carbs aside,
it's absolutely teeming

114
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,563
with gluten.

115
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:46,694
I knew that. I just... I forgot.

116
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,348
- You didn't know that.
- I did.

117
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:49,480
Don't worry about that, though.
It's all good.

118
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,611
I ate the crust, too.

119
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,700
Oh, so you came over with
a box of tomato sauce?

120
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,832
Oh, great.

121
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,355
- Dennis will have the sauce.
- Sugar.

122
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,574
- Sugar.
- Uh, no.

123
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,271
Actually, I slurped that up, too,

124
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,421
because that was just kind of
looking good, so I figured...

125
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:01,579
So you ate them all separately...
all the elements...

126
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,537
and then came over with
an empty pizza box?

127
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,496
- This is a nice gesture, you know.
- It's not.

128
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,411
- It's the suggestion of food.
- Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys.

129
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,848
Oh, my God. You are not going to believe

130
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,067
- what just happened to me. Okay.
- Christ. She's here now.

131
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,634
- So, I'm wandering around, right, for hours.
- Yeah.

132
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,375
I-I'm just thinking about
what happened tonight

133
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,724
and... with Frank, you know...

134
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,552
and-and I'm not proud of it,
but I, uh...

135
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,815
Something weird kind of happened
to me with that whole thing,

136
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,774
'cause I... I got a pretty good rush

137
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,732
from a man almost dying
right in front of me.

138
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,647
I-I liked it, and-and,

139
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:28,301
you know, I'm thinking about it so much

140
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,433
that I sort of space out.

141
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:30,521
Long story short,

142
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,610
I wind up in the middle
of the street, okay?

143
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,308
And an Uber just goes flying by me

144
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,441
at, like-like, 50. Almost hit me!

145
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:38,746
You're so good at telling stories.
So concise.

146
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,444
I wish it did hit you.

147
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,576
You guys, the rush I got from that...

148
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,535
- You would not believe it.
- Okay, I-I...

149
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,579
I don't believe it.
I don't care about it.

150
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:47,451
- I don't care. I don't care.
- It blew my mind.

151
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,756
- Why'd you come over?
- No, wait, I-I can't stand this.

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,845
I-I can't do this.
I mean, it's in the middle of the night.

153
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,195
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay? And I'm surrounded by lunatics here.

154
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,545
We are surrounded by lunatics.

155
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,547
- You're one of the lunatics!
- What?

156
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,385
Okay, you know what? This is
the one thing I've learned tonight.

157
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,667
- I can't depend on anyone but myself, okay?
- What? What?

158
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:02,117
So I got to take care of myself.
I got to stay healthy.

159
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,684
You know what? I'm gonna go to bed.

160
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,294
That's what I should...
I'm gonna go to bed.

161
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,514
Go to bed? What are you, 40?

162
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,473
We're the same age!

163
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:12,333
Uh, Dennis, should I go to bed, too?

164
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,825
I don't care!

165
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,609
- He said yes, I think?
- Oh, I don't think he gives a shit

166
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,002
- what you do.
- I don't think he cares.

167
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,656
He cares because we
depend on each other,

168
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,571
so I should probably go to sleep
because we depend on each other.

169
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,224
Tomorrow,
I got to wake up and depend on him.

170
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:24,618
He's gonna depend on me,
so good night, guys.

171
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:30,581
Okay, so, what do you want to get into?

172
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,670
Oh, I kind of wanted to
hang out with the guys, so...

173
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:34,672
I know. I know. Me, too.

174
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:37,588
- But they went to bed, so just you and me.
- Mm.

175
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,417
Yeah, but I-I don't want it to be.

176
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,597
- You know?
- Oh.

177
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,642
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,648
Okay.

179
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:05,616
Hey-o! Look who's up. Sleepyhead.

180
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,749
Here you go. You know
you grind your teeth at night?

181
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,316
What is this?

182
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,144
What the hell are you doing in my home?

183
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,580
I'm moving in.

184
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:15,756
Hey, you had my back.
Now I'm gonna have yours.

185
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,975
Uh, first thing we got to do

186
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,542
is beef up the security around here.

187
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,370
You know how easy it was
for me to get in that window?

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,678
Took me all of 30
seconds with this hammer.

189
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:27,159
I could have been bashing your face in

190
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,161
before you knew what hit you,

191
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,207
which would've been this hammer,
which I already had in my hand,

192
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,687
in case you weren't listening.

193
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,297
Wh-What's going on?

194
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:37,299
It's you and me against the world, kid.

195
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:38,692
You got a nice place here.

196
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,520
Wouldn't be bad to have a roommate.

197
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,391
Okay, look, I only saved you

198
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,611
because it's what any
decent person would do,

199
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,873
but I don't need a roommate.

200
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,745
I already live here with my mother.

201
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,921
Oh. That old vegetable lady is your mom?

202
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:51,966
Nah, you don't have to worry about her.

203
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,446
I took care of her.

204
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,882
Took care of her? What do you mean?

205
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,537
I threw a sheet over her head.
She was freaking me out.

206
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,757
Mom! Oh, my God!

207
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,541
Are you all right?

208
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:04,805
I don't think she can hear you, pal.
She's gonzo.

209
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,198
Why would you want to live with that

210
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:08,635
when you can live with me
and get a lot of good action?

211
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,682
Please leave before I call the police.

212
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,783
Suit yourself.

213
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,816
- Door or window?
- The door is fine.

214
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,992
It's gonna take me a long time
to bash through that door.

215
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,699
Guys, how long is this gonna take?

216
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,405
Dennis needs to finish his
pre-workout shake, Charlie.

217
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,104
And I rubbed down his calves,

218
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,226
and now I have to tape his ankles.

219
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,228
Yeah, but can we just,
like, play already?

220
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,838
No, we can't just play, Charlie.
We can't just play.

221
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:40,205
Are you insane?! We can't just play!

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,373
Uh, what's he...? What?

223
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,411
Look, honestly, Dennis
shouldn't even be playing basketball

224
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:45,454
- in the first place...
- Wrong, Mac.

225
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,414
Basketball is exactly
what I should be doing.

226
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:49,981
It's what men like Frank never did,

227
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,592
and their bodies became soft
and feeble and-and round

228
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:55,682
and at high risk for injury
and disease and choking on things.

229
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,205
- Well, can we do something?
- Yes.

230
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:01,035
Let's just... let's begin
with a light warm-up of, uh... passing,

231
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:03,298
and then after 15 minutes or so of that,

232
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,606
we'll work our way into a light jog,
and then we'll do some layups.

233
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,696
- Passing. All right.
- Too hard. Too fast.

234
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:13,613
Still a little bit too hard.

235
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:14,701
Simple.

236
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,144
- Oh.
- Ah, damn it.

237
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,016
Jesus, man. What-what the hell
was that? Are you okay?

238
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,671
Ow. I don't know.
My... timing's a little bit off.

239
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:30,848
I... might not be feeling
too well all of a sudden.

240
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,197
Wait a second.

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,765
Dennis, I-I feel like there's
a little bit of pollen in the air.

242
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,767
Pollen?!

243
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,769
You didn't tell me there
was to be pollen today.

244
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,335
I-I can't do pollen. I don't do pollen.

245
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,859
I know. I didn't know. I mean, maybe,

246
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:43,295
on account of the season,
I thought maybe...

247
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:44,905
- Oh. Oh!
- I'm sorry.

248
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:48,300
- Come on, Dee. Why are you here?
- Hear me out, you guys.

249
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:50,476
This whole thing with
Frank and the Uber stuff...

250
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,782
it's got me thinking, you know.

251
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,653
I feel like the only
way to truly live life

252
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:56,264
to its fullest is to
live it on the edge.

253
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,136
- On the edge of what?
- On the edge of life or death.

254
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,790
So, I went into the
Puerto Rican part of town,

255
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,269
started making fun
of their big fat asses

256
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:02,706
and asked them if they were Dominican.

257
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,751
- What?! - Yeah.
- Why-why would you do that?

258
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,492
Well, to be fair,
I did start with some stuff

259
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:07,711
that was slightly less offensive,
but turns out,

260
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,756
they're a very lovely community,
so I really had to...

261
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,814
I had to dig deeper.

262
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,541
Really, really hit 'em where it hurt.

263
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,673
Anyway, they're on their way.

264
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:14,935
They're on their way?!

265
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,763
Yeah, after what I said, sure, yeah.

266
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:19,113
I was like, "Um, you guys,
why don't you take a break

267
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:21,768
"from your cockfighting and,
uh, you know, hop in your rafts

268
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,814
and come bring it to a real American?"

269
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,467
And then I was like, "Follow me."

270
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,296
- That's Mexican!
- That's Mexican.

271
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,558
- What are you doing?
- Oh! That did it.

272
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:30,690
- Why are you doing this?
- It pissed 'em off.

273
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:31,822
Because it-it gave me a r...

274
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,933
a-a thrill like you wouldn't believe.

275
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,173
Anyway,
you guys want in on this with me?

276
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,640
- No!
- No! - What?!

277
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:37,697
You-you would put us all at risk

278
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:41,396
with your suicidal race-baiting.
I... I-I...

279
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,268
Eh, something's off. I-I got to go home.

280
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,617
- What?
- Oh, Dennis. Dennis, yes.

281
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:45,705
- I got to go home.
- You're leaving?

282
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,167
You know what?
He-he needs his post-workout shake.

283
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:49,535
- You haven't worked out yet.
- That's what it is. I need a...

284
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:50,797
Yes, we were playing basketball,

285
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,565
and I've depleted my electrolytes,

286
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,662
and now I'm Dee-shaming,

287
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:54,816
and that's depleted me even more,

288
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:55,846
- so, yes. - Oh, come on.
- You know what?

289
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:56,977
- Uh, let me... let me get you home, Dennis.
- I'm wobbly.

290
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:58,326
Here. You can count on me, buddy.

291
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,588
- All right, get me...
- You can count on me.

292
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:01,808
- Get me home.
- He can count on me, guys.

293
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,155
The hell's wrong with him?

294
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,769
Uh, pollen, I guess.

295
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,727
Huh.

296
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:11,339
So, uh, you want to take
this beating with me?

297
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,863
No.

298
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,039
Hey, Mom.

299
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,175
Sorry I'm late.

300
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,656
Had to work a double shift.

301
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,963
Hey-o! All good.

302
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:28,449
Made her dinner already.
She's eating blue.

303
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:29,967
- What is this?
- Well, I figure,

304
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,752
you were at work,
and your mom was stuck home alone,

305
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,798
so I broke in again.

306
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:37,539
What did you do to her?

307
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,890
What? Well, I just
spruced her up a little bit.

308
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,805
- What do you think?
- I think she look nuts!

309
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,851
Okay, you know what? Stop coming here.

310
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:47,375
I don't want you here.
Stop breaking into my home, okay?

311
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:50,988
Whoa. Why are you being
such a hard-on about this?

312
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,772
I'm just trying to help a little bit.

313
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:55,253
You know, I did a little
homework while you were away.

314
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:59,257
You graduated at the top
of your class with honors,

315
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,912
and were enrolled in pilot school.

316
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,348
But then, your mommy got sick,

317
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:06,351
and you had to take other
jobs and make ends meet.

318
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,701
I mean, it must've been
really hard being up there,

319
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,224
slinging V8 Juice

320
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:12,966
when you should've been
captain of the ship.

321
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:15,882
What is this?

322
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:19,059
Somebody enrolled somebody
back into pilot school.

323
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,845
So, what do you say we quit
that dead-end job you're in

324
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:24,282
and put your mommy in a real nice home?

325
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:27,067
Something with 24-hour care, on me.

326
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,722
And not one of them
bang 'em and bin 'em joints.

327
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:31,202
Something really nice.

328
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,073
Would be nice to go back
to pilot school.

329
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,858
Yeah. Yeah.

330
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,294
Oh, let me give you some more.

331
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:38,165
Yeah. Here you go. Here you go.

332
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,734
Yeah. Blue has the most antioxygens.

333
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,216
Ugh.

334
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,623
Christ. I feel like I'm dying.

335
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:49,285
Just let me help you, Dennis.

336
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,874
Here, have another health shake.

337
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,050
No. I don't want another one
of your stupid shakes, Mac.

338
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,399
All right? And for the last time,

339
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,704
please just leave me alone.

340
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,968
Just...

341
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,841
- What are you doing?
- I want to throw this shake

342
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:03,495
in your stupid face, but I'm struggling.

343
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,889
Charlie, will you please throw this
shake in Mac's face for me?

344
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:07,412
- Me?
- Yes.

345
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,762
- Oh.
- Dennis, do you want me to throw it into my own face?

346
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,851
That would ruin the effect.

347
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,766
Right. Charlie, throw this in my face.

348
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,942
Well, don't tell him
to throw it in your face,

349
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,291
because now I feel like you want it.

350
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:18,858
Uh, what if I throw it in my face?

351
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:20,860
- I don't want it.
- No, you're not following.

352
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,557
He wants you to throw that in my face,

353
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,863
and he wants me to not want it.

354
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,431
- I don't want it, right, Dennis?
- You've both ruined the moment.

355
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:27,911
You've misunderstood what I'm going for,

356
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,217
and I'm just gonna go lie down
on my bed. I feel so awful.

357
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:32,263
- Yeah. I'll carry you, because I...
- No, no, no. You're not gonna...

358
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,960
No. You dropped me twice last time.

359
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,441
You bumbling idiot.
You're probably also covered in pollen,

360
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,095
which is making me feel horrible.

361
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:41,054
A pollen-covered man offering
to carry a-a perfectly well man.

362
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:42,882
It's insane.

363
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,921
- Hey, uh, can I have your...?
- I'm sorry.

364
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:45,972
You mind if I have his shake, then,

365
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,104
- if he's not gonna have it?
- Huh?

366
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:48,540
- Can I have this?
- No, that's, uh...

367
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,108
That's his shake, so...
you can't have it. Just...

368
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:54,328
Yeah, but... I-I want it,
and he said he didn't want it.

369
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,287
Yeah, yeah,
but he might want it later, so...

370
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,810
Yeah, yeah, but I kind of want it now,

371
00:13:57,854 --> 00:13:59,159
so I'd like to have the shake, then.

372
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:00,552
Yeah, but it's not really for you.

373
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:02,075
Yeah, but I want it,
and he's not having it,

374
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,598
so I don't really see any reason why...

375
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,992
- You can't have it, Charlie!
- Yeah! I will drink it!

376
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,039
What is this?

377
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,998
It's a... protein shake.

378
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,782
It's just a health shake for Dennis.

379
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:15,306
Yeah, but it tastes like pizza.

380
00:14:15,349 --> 00:14:16,916
Oh, really? Nah, it's...

381
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,744
You know what?
There's a lot of different flavors.

382
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,181
That's probably, like,
the pizza-flavored one.

383
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,009
And soda.

384
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:26,056
Wha... Are you feeding Dennis

385
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,145
blended-up pizza and soda shakes?

386
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:30,538
Shh. Yes. Uh, I...

387
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:33,802
- Why? Why are you doing that?
- Because I'm...

388
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,630
I'm poisoning him, all right? Just...

389
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,067
- What?!
- A little bit.

390
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,983
Look, uh, all the gluten
and the sugar and the dairy,

391
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,507
uh, just wreaks havoc
on his system, you know?

392
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,812
- Oh.
- And it makes him so weak.

393
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:47,033
And then he's gonna depend
on me to take care of him,

394
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,774
to bring him back from
the brink of death.

395
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,297
- Why are you doing that?
- You know what I'm saying?

396
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:52,386
- Well, because I want him to depend on me, Charlie.
- Oh.

397
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,432
Nah! That's gonna take

398
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:55,999
- way too long.
- Whoa.

399
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,870
Dee, did you just scale up the side

400
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,089
- of the building?
- Yeah.

401
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,873
Free soloed it.

402
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,440
Sucked though. Didn't feel a thing.

403
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,836
Look, Mac, Munchausen by proxy,
that's cute and everything.

404
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,228
But if you want Dennis
to really depend on you,

405
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,928
you're gonna have
to save his life... for real.

406
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,669
Oh.

407
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,976
And I'm gonna help you.

408
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,847
Aw...

409
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,241
Don't. Just don't.

410
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,642
- Hey! You're just in time for a blue feast.
- Hey.

411
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,818
- Mm.
- Did you have a good sleep?

412
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:34,037
Yeah. To be honest,

413
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,864
I had the best night's sleep of my life.

414
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,127
- Oh.
- Yeah.

415
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,824
I feel kind of guilty
saying this, but, uh,

416
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:40,434
since you found a home for my mom,

417
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,870
I feel like this-this huge weight

418
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:43,220
- has been lifted off of me.
- Ah.

419
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:44,917
- Great! Let's eat.
- Yeah.

420
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,832
- Come on. Okay. All right.
- Okay. Great.

421
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,268
- See what we got here.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:49,835
Uh...

423
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,229
Yeah, I don't know
if I want to eat that.

424
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,013
Oh. Oh, okay.

425
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,494
Well, I just worked on it a long time.

426
00:15:56,537 --> 00:16:00,150
Well, three of the things are
still in plastic packaging.

427
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:03,414
All right. Well, how 'bout
if you just make a speech?

428
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,024
- A what?
- A speech. You know,

429
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:07,896
something to honor our new relationship.

430
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,594
Uh, do I have to?

431
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,248
Yes.

432
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,901
Oh.

433
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:15,165
Okay. Well, uh...

434
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,470
this is exciting.

435
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:18,385
Good start.

436
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:22,041
Uh, I'm excited
to get back in the simulator,

437
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,912
log some more hours.

438
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,044
Oh, good, good.

439
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:27,133
Well, but don't just make
the speech about you.

440
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:29,701
- Oh.
- Put me in there a little bit, too.

441
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,883
Oh. Okay. Uh...

442
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,838
Uh, thanks for sticking
my mom in that home.

443
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,232
- Never could've done it myself.
- Yeah. Mm, mm.

444
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,539
She always said it's the last
thing she ever wanted, so...

445
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:43,671
- So, thank you.
- What?

446
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:44,759
- Thank you.
- Wait, your mom said

447
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:45,847
that's the last thing she wanted,

448
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:47,501
- was to be in a home?
- Yeah, yeah.

449
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:49,286
She said it all the time.

450
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:51,766
So, when you saw her in there,
why'd you let her stay?

451
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,420
Well, I didn't see her. You took her.

452
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:55,335
You mean you didn't
have the decency to go?

453
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,208
You told me not to,
to avoid the emotion of it all.

454
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,471
Well, I told you not to
because I was sticking her

455
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:02,299
in a bang 'em and bin 'em joint.

456
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,996
- What?
- They're much cheaper!

457
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm starting to think I
had you pegged all wrong.

458
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:09,088
I'm sorry, can we go back to the
"bang 'em and bin 'em" thing?

459
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,873
To think I trusted my life with you,
when you would treat

460
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,136
your mother like that.

461
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,573
I bet you'd let me get
spit-roasted by Latin Kings

462
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:17,314
just like that, wouldn't you?

463
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,355
I'm sorry,
I can't follow this conversation.

464
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,035
- Where is my mother?
- And if you think

465
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,320
I'm paying the 40 grand
you owe that flight school,

466
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:25,365
you got another thing coming!

467
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,237
- I owe them? I can't afford that.
- Yes!

468
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,326
Well, then you probably can't
afford the bin 'em joint,

469
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,589
'cause that shit ain't free, bozo!

470
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:35,288
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of here! Have a nice life!

471
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:38,117
And... kiss my ass, dirtbag.

472
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:40,076
I can't afford any of this!

473
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay.

474
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:49,737
This powder is a major histamine toxin.

475
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:51,174
The second Dennis drinks it,

476
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:53,219
his throat's just gonna
start to seize right up.

477
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:55,262
After a few minutes, Mac, you jab him

478
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:56,918
with that EpiPen... you save his life.

479
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,311
- After a few minutes?
- Yeah.

480
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,922
15, 20 tops. Just until he flatlines.
Then you bring him back.

481
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:03,343
- Uh, no, Dee, we're not gonna do that.
- Wait, what?

482
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:04,417
You're not gonna poison him?

483
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:05,753
You don't think Dennis is gonna see

484
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:07,407
right through this silly ruse?

485
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:08,843
- All right.
- Yeah. Now, Frank, on the other hand...

486
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,150
- Yeah. Now, Frank's not gonna see through it.
- No.

487
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,717
So-so that's why we invited Frank.

488
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,633
Because Charlie and I can jump
to action and save Frank's life.

489
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:16,851
- Together.
- Now... Yeah. Now, of course,

490
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,375
Dennis will see through
that ruse as well,

491
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:19,811
but he'll be very impressed

492
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,335
with how far I'm willing to go
to prove my worth to him.

493
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,597
- Then Dennis will love me.
- Frank's not gonna

494
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:24,772
read into any of this.

495
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:26,209
He's just gonna be
happy that I saved him.

496
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,645
Listen,
consider the flatline though, okay?

497
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,735
'Cause I really got to know
what people see on the other side.

498
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,302
- Yeah. They're coming. Shut up. Shut up.
- Shut up, Dee. Dee.

499
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,217
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
- Frank! Dennis!

500
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,175
Here, uh, come-come on. Have a seat.

501
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,829
Thanks for joining us, guys.

502
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:41,180
Uh, Frank, I, uh...
I picked up your hair for you, so...

503
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,618
Dennis, you're looking better.

504
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:47,447
I'm feeling better,
Mac, no thanks to you.

505
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,275
Okay, guys,
I'd-I'd like to make a quick toast,

506
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,885
if I could, before we begin.

507
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,018
Oh, my God! Why?

508
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:54,746
Why are you people all here?

509
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:55,803
Hey, man, don't interrupt, okay?

510
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:57,675
We're not ready to order. Go.

511
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,329
Well, I couldn't take
your order if I wanted to,

512
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,418
because I'm just here
to beg for my job back,

513
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,810
thanks to this guy.

514
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,682
Do I know you?

515
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:06,074
- Unbelievable.
- I don't know what's going on here.

516
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,902
- Can I get a whiskey, pal?
- Can I have one as well?

517
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,687
Okay, guys, uh, before we begin,

518
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,863
I-I'd like to make a-a quick speech.

519
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:13,038
Frank... look,

520
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,163
we all understand why
you were mad at us.

521
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:17,695
You have every right to be.
But I'd like to make a peace offering.

522
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:20,353
I sharpened my teeth, FYI.

523
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,439
That's good.
Wish you'd let me do it, but...

524
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,441
- Please don't interrupt. I...
- Charlie, would...

525
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:25,616
- could you get to the...
- Yeah, okay. Uh...

526
00:19:26,593 --> 00:19:27,991
Over here is the peace offering.

527
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:30,273
Oh. Whoa. Is that a... is that a shake?

528
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,057
Yeah. Can you guys just
not interrupt me though?

529
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,450
- Can I have that, please?
- No.

530
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:35,452
- It's not for you.
- Uh... - No. Yeah, no, no.

531
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:37,584
Because th-that's blue,
and you don't like blue, Dennis.

532
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:39,456
Uh, well,
I would very much like to have it,

533
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,022
because I do feel like the
shakes are finally kicking in

534
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,633
and that's why I'm feeling
a little bit better, so...

535
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:43,634
- Oh.
- Yeah.

536
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,372
Well, no, it's not for him, okay?

537
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:46,724
- It's for Frank.
- I'm not interested.

538
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,160
He doesn't want it,
so I would like to have it, please.

539
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,596
Absolutely not. I forbid it.

540
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,642
Stop trying to prove yourself
to me in all the wrong ways, Mac.

541
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:53,034
Yeah, look, Frank,
just drink the shake, okay?

542
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:54,253
You have to have it.

543
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:55,907
- He doesn't want it!
- Somebody drink it!

544
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,604
Give it to Dennis, for crying out loud.

545
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,389
- Give it to me!
- No! Absolutely not!

546
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,651
Why not, goddamn it?

547
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,913
- Because it's poisoned!
- Oh!

548
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,744
- Uh, what?
- I had to tell him!

549
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,798
- He was gonna...
- Oh, come on!

550
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,657
- It was gonna be his blood and...
- There's poison in it.

551
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,485
- We poisoned it.
- Excuse me?

552
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,835
- It has a little bit of poison in it.
- It has poison in it.

553
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,967
- Poison in it.
- It's got... It's poisoned.

554
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:17,668
You were gonna poison me, Charlie?

555
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,539
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And I was as well.

556
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,063
It's just...
But I was gonna save you, dude.

557
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:23,413
Me, too.

558
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,545
- Like, right afterward.
- Immediately.

559
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:28,331
I should've done that
in the first place, man.

560
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:29,767
- Me, too.
- Shut up, Mac!

561
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,159
You're stepping on my...

562
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,467
Look, Frank, I'm sorry, dude.

563
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:35,947
I screwed up, man.

564
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,557
I should've saved you,

565
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,256
and I'll always save you
from now on, I promise.

566
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:44,129
Thanks, Charlie.

567
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,436
I knew you had my back.

568
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,916
And I had your back, too, with the plan.

569
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,657
I was gonna...

570
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:51,963
- do the plan...
- Yeah, Mac glommed on

571
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:53,443
- to my thing and...
- Yeah, and save Frank.

572
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,488
- Yeah.
- And then you were gonna be impressed by that

573
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:58,535
- and see that you need me as well.
- Oh.

574
00:20:58,578 --> 00:20:59,666
Okay. I think I understand.

575
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,886
So you were still gonna
rely on a decision

576
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,366
that somebody else made,
only, this time,

577
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,976
you were potentially gonna kill a man?

578
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,328
Are you not pleased?

579
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:12,833
- No.
- Holy shit. I think Dee drank the shake.

580
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:14,812
Dee, did you... Dee?

581
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,683
- Oh! - Holy shit.
- Oh, Dee!

582
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,599
- That's okay. I have this.
- Uh, okay.

583
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,992
- Hit her with it, man.
- All right, go.

584
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,689
- No.
- I'm telling you to do it.

585
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,691
I don't need you to tell me
what to do, Dennis.

586
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,214
I'm going to make my own decision.

587
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:27,825
Oh, Mac, now is not the time for this...

588
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:30,567
Charlie, shut up!
I'm done with your plans.

589
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,612
- She ain't moving, man.
- She wanted to see the other side,

590
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:36,224
and I want Dennis to see that
I can make my own decision.

591
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:40,011
Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you people?!

592
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,551
Okay. Uh... Ah.

593
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:51,758
I saw it! I saw the other side.
I didn't like it.

594
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,083
I hated it. It was just blackness.

595
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:54,250
There's nothing there. It's just dark.

596
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:56,498
That's it. Just lights out.
I don't want to do that anymore.

597
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,508
I don't want to live on the edge.
I don't want to die. Thank you.

598
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,814
Thank you so much, whoever you are.

599
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:02,799
Hey, dude, can we get some,

600
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:05,166
- like, bread sticks and menus and, you know...
- Yeah.

601
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,212
- I mean, we've been here a while.
- Dinner and a show.
