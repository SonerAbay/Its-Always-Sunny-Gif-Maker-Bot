1
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:03,756
That's a great looking set of knives.
Where'd you get those?

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:06,056
Well, this old magician guy
was trying to unload 'em.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,121
- Like, magical trick knives or...?
- Well, the knives are real.

4
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:11,540
I mean, they're used for magical
tricks, but they're real.

5
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:13,399
They're sharp, too.
Well, I'll show you.

6
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:15,841
Dee, can you get up against
the wall for a second?

7
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,470
No. You're not throwing knives at me.

8
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:19,139
Let's throw them, regardless.

9
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:20,932
Start running, 'cause we're coming.

10
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:22,906
- Ten, nine,
- Don't you dare.

11
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,628
eight, seven,

12
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:27,647
- six, five, four...
- Okay, listen up, everybody!

13
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:30,274
- We're in the middle of something.
- I got news.

14
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:31,913
Your mother is dead. Ha!

15
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:36,613
- Nice try. Very funny, Frank.
- I'm serious, this time.

16
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:38,602
She had a botched neck lift.

17
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,701
She's as dead as disco.

18
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:44,072
Who wants champagne?

19
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:47,349

Episode 3x03

22
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,114
{\pos(192,155)}I am so sorry.

23
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:21,075
My apologies. I'm so busy today.
It's good to see all of you.

24
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,369
That's quite all right.
Don't worry about it.

25
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,337
{\pos(192,205)}Would now be a good time
to say few words

26
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,307
{\pos(192,205)}about my wonderfully warm
and caring mother?

27
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:30,528
- No. Just get to the reading part.
- Let's get on with it, man.

28
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:31,711
Let's go.

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,298
Which one of you is Frank Reynolds?

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,567
Yo.

31
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,511
I have something here that I need
to read to you from Barbara.

32
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,080
"Frank, if your...

33
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:47,727
"fat monkey heart is still beating,
then congratulations.

34
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:52,471
"I want you to know that I hereby leave
all of your money to Bruce Mathis,

35
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:54,108
"the real father of my children..."

36
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,569
- What?
- Bruce Mathis?

37
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:59,794
"... a handsome man
with a beautiful soul...

38
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,283
"and a nicer penis."

39
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,453
You're giving all my money
to that jerk-off?

40
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:08,523
- I'm reading what's on the document.
- Why are you giving it to him?

41
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,375
- She barely even knew him.
- I'm not giving any money to anybody.

42
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,336
I'm just reading what's on a will.

43
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,172
- Where is that rat bastard?
- Sir, I don't know...

44
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:19,438
I wanna smash his face
until he's dead!

45
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,619
Killed dead!

46
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:23,679
Will you forget about Bruce!
Mom just gave away all of our money!

47
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,759
You know what, we should
just move forward, okay?

48
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,447
"For my darling son Dennis,"

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,230
Presumably...
"I give you my house... "

50
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:35,983
Yeah! Okay, now it's starting
to make sense. Read on.

51
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:39,153
"... on the sole condition
that Frank not be allowed in. "

52
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:40,821
- I'd never let him in.
- What?!

53
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,084
"Deandra...

54
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:44,158
"... you get nothing.

55
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,997
"You were a disappointment
and a mistake."

56
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:49,288
A mistake? We're twins.

57
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,583
We were born at the same time.
You're not making any sense.

58
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:54,418
Tell that bitch it doesn't make sense!

59
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,314
I'm reading the words
that someone else wrote, okay?

60
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,092
I don't know your mom,
never met your mom.

61
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:07,456
In fact, I'm certainly not speaking
to your mom now, because she's dead.

62
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,434
We know she's dead.
We're venting 'cause we're frustrated.

63
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,979
You tell her she's a goddamn whore!

64
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,064
Always been a whore!

65
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,942
What about jewelry?
Does it say anything about jewelry?

66
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:20,995
It does say something about
the jewelry in here in that,

67
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:22,571
she wants to be buried in it.

68
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,836
Goddamn it!

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,635
She's taking it into the grave!

70
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:30,871
Tell you what, you son of a bitch,
I'm very disappointed in you today.

71
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,505
Very upset with you.
You tell her for me

72
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:36,272
that I will be in touch
with her somehow.

73
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,170
Tell her she's a bitch!

74
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,381
These are awkward
situations often, and...

75
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,294
I know it can be difficult...

76
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:45,857
Thanks for the house, dude.

77
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:49,890
You know... I didn't give you
the house. That's not how

78
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:52,280
- this whole situation works.
- Yeah, you did!

79
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,595
Jesus Christ.

80
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,321
I got a plan to get back
at your mother.

81
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,994
Too late...
I'm already full throttle over here.

82
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:09,136
I'm gonna dig up her body
and snatch back that jewelry.

83
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,786
That's insane!

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,583
That woman is buried
down there like Mr. T.

85
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,471
I gotta go while
the earth's still loose.

86
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,377
I know how to get
the money back from Bruce.

87
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,607
- What's your plan?
- All right.

88
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,397
You call Brucey on the phone
and tell him that you want

89
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:29,505
to introduce him to your new fiance.

90
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,358
- Who's that?
- Me.

91
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:38,356
This house sure brings back
a lot of memories.

92
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:40,497
Look what I just found
in Dee's old room!

93
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,544
It's her middle school diary, dude!
Ooh, yeah!

94
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,156
Who gives a shit?

95
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:50,857
This is her diary. It's got
all her secrets and shit in here.

96
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:54,455
It says "Keep Out." There's a little
lock that we... We'll open it later.

97
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:58,702
We are not reading Dee's
middle school diary to you, bro!

98
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,669
We need to start the healing process.

99
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,743
I'm devastated over here.
We need to throw a big-ass party.

100
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:07,277
I need to be amongst my friends.
Let's call the crew.

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,387
- Let's round the boys up!
- Round the crew up!

102
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,055
Let's have a kick-ass party!

103
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:14,141
- We got the diary! And the crew!
- The boys are back in town!

104
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:20,635
I have two numbers in my phone:

105
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:23,395
Charlie and Dennis.

106
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,736
- Well, what about all our friends?
- What about Dooley? Call Dooley!

107
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:31,283
- Dooley! He loves a good party!
- Let's call Dooley!

108
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:34,078
Dooley in the house!

109
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,581
Dooley killed himself.

110
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,608
About two years back now.

111
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,450
It's just a real sad, sad thing
for him and his family.

112
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:46,590
I knew he was...

113
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,071
- Depressed.
- Very sad...

114
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,388
How about, uh, let's call Stash!
Let's get the Stash man!

115
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,141
Stash? Stash man? What'd you do?

116
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,045
- I set him on fire.
- Son of a bitch.

117
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,869
Forget Stash. I didn't like him
anyway. Let's get Z-Man!

118
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,480
I banged his sister.

119
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,276
Sully! I got Sully's number.

120
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:08,347
He has a restraing order against me.
Can't go within 500 feet of him.

121
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:09,989
Plus, I banged his sister, too.

122
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,888
- Did you really?
- She was gross.

123
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,124
I remember that.

124
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,785
So wait a minute, we got no friends?

125
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,447
Looks like it, right?

126
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,289
Wow, that hits home.

127
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,385
That's terrible.

128
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,425
Guys, guys, do you realize
what that means?

129
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,635
If we were to all die suddenly,
just like my mom did,

130
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:30,551
we'd have nobody left to mourn us.

131
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:36,182
No one left to tell of our great
adventures and our glorious triumphs.

132
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:40,102
- We got to make friends.
- All our triumphs and our tales and...

133
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,354
We need to preserve our legacy.

134
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,648
- That's what I'm saying.
- Our whole legacy!

135
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,735
- Let's go out and make some friends.
- Let's do that. But first,

136
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,690
who wants to run through
a quick chapter of this diary?

137
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,076
- How's the ponytail look?
- It's ridiculous.

138
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:59,121
Why are you wearing this whole get-up?
Bruce has never seen you.

139
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:03,310
If we're gonna pull this thing off,
I got to turn into a liberal yahoo

140
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,662
just like Bruce.

141
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:07,630
When he gets here, I want you to hold
my hand through the whole thing.

142
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,758
- I won't do that.
- Look,

143
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,883
you've go to stop thinking of me
as your dad

144
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:16,169
and start thinking of me
as your fiance, Seamus.

145
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,807
Could we think of a less creepy angle?

146
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,519
But this is a grift.
I mean, that's the way it is.

147
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:23,187
You got to stay in character,

148
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,563
all the time.

149
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,358
As soon as you break character,
you blow the grift.

150
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:29,763
- Hand. Hand.
- I don't want to touch you.

151
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,483
- Holding hands.
- Goddamn it.

152
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,409
Ah, my little girl, how you doing?
Are you okay?

153
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:41,205
Well, no, no.
I'm very broken up inside.

154
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:45,489
Bruce, this is Seamus,

155
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:47,130
my fiance.

156
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,964
I am also broken up.

157
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:54,072
What say we all bring it on in
for a hug.

158
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,778
We're doing hugs.

159
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,124
Oh, I'm so sorry I missed
that funeral.

160
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:04,823
We were in Uganda doing a lot
of work with the AIDS cris there...

161
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,231
AIDS?
You touch anybody?

162
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:09,817
Well, sure.

163
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,203
What kind of shit is that?
You just hugged me!

164
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,450
Why would you do that?

165
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:14,456
Seamus is joking.

166
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,699
He's got a... he's got
a very dry sense of humor.

167
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:19,268
I'm not joking!
That shit is serious!

168
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,407
I've got to take a shower now!

169
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,052
- That's kind of... odd...
- Oh, yeah. Well, that's my guy.

170
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,272
You know, he's got a little
bit of a germ problem.

171
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:33,425
- I'll get him some books for that.
- He's... he's grieving and... yeah.

172
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,594
- But you seem to be holding up okay.
- It's funny that I seem like that

173
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:39,052
because I'm not holding up okay.
I'm very sad.

174
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,588
- I'm devastated.
- Nothing tougher than losing a parent.

175
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:42,683
Oh, it's the worst, and...

176
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,137
So she gave you all of our money, huh?
All of... all of...

177
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,960
All of our fortune...
she gave it to you.

178
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:50,524
Weird, right?

179
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:55,498
Good news is, it's all gonna go to help
the less fortunate, every penny.

180
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,583
- That is good news.
- It's a done deal.

181
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:58,949
Well, that's actually

182
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,552
why we brought you here.

183
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,831
Oh, see, Seamus and I have a plan.

184
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:05,372
We want to adopt a ton of kids.

185
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:06,913
Isn't that wonderful

186
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:10,940
that we'll need to use our fortune,
that my mother gave you

187
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,012
- to shove at these kids.
- You know what I think?

188
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,528
I think I know exactly
what you and Seamus need.

189
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:17,676
Can you sit tight?

190
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,845
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can, okay?

191
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:21,450
Okay.

192
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,386
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

193
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,815
Burn these clothes.

194
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,618
Tracy, cancel all my appointments.

195
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,025
It's time for my daughter
and that idiot who raised her

196
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,197
to learn a lesson.

197
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:41,167
Guys, I don't know
if I'm feeling this flyer idea.

198
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,734
- Really?
- It's perfect, dude.

199
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,317
How else are three guys in their
20s supposed to make friends?

200
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,647
There's no system in place.
A flyer does all the work.

201
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,375
All right, read back what we
got so far, 'cause I don't...

202
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:51,563
"What up?

203
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,639
"We're 3 cool guys looking
for other cool guys

204
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,886
"who wanna hang out
in our party mansion."

205
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:59,257
- Sounds a little gay, right?
- Yeah. It does sound gay.

206
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:02,037
- Write: "Nothing sexual."
- Good. Okay.

207
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:05,399
"Cool guys looking for other cool guys
who wanna hang out in out party mansion.

208
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,455
"Nothing Sexual."

209
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,798
And add "Fighters welcome", 'cause,

210
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,535
tough dudes and some big dudes.

211
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:13,868
I don't want a bunch of tough guys
wanting to fight me.

212
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,828
It would be good
to have extra protection.

213
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:19,822
- Extra protection and...
- Well, put "Fitness encouraged."

214
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,617
- Beautiful.
- That sounds confusing.

215
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,493
- I'll put "Dudes in good shape."
- There you go. That solves it.

216
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,812
I like it. Okay, but we also
need a guy who's funny and fat.

217
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,999
We need a funny fat guy.
'Cause every crew has one.

218
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,659
Well, I'm the funny fat guy,
so don't worry about that.

219
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,687
- You're not fat, dude.
- You're also not funny.

220
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,880
I want somebody who does
observational humor...

221
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:39,717
That would be good.
Observational humor is cool.

222
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,552
I'm just gonna put
"Nothing sexual" again

223
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:43,457
- just to reiterate.
- Underline it.

224
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:45,180
Please. Be very clear with that.

225
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,332
And I'm thinking that the flyer
should be in the shape of a beermug.

226
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,722
- Too complicated.
- Yeah. What about, uh, bicep?

227
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:53,750
A bicep. Bicep's good.

228
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,180
- All right, let's go with the bicep.
- Okay, read.

229
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:57,692
Here we go. "What up?"

230
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:00,006
"We're three cool guys
looking for other cool guys

231
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,962
"who want to hang out in our party
mansion. Nothing sexual.

232
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,526
"Dudes in good shape encouraged.

233
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:08,294
"If you're fat, you should be able
to find humor in the little things.

234
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:10,782
Again, "nothing sexual". Underlined.

235
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,285
- Okay.
- Great.

236
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,575
- I have no problem with that.
- No. Let's go meet some men.

237
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:24,518
Lookin' good, bro.
Looking very good.

238
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:25,929
I'm sorry?

239
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:27,889
Oh, your pants... nice cut.

240
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,639
That vertical line on the side
gives your body good length.

241
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,843
Do you work here?

242
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:36,684
I'm just looking to meet some new guys.

243
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:38,919
I saw you from across the way
and I thought, yeah,

244
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:41,774
this guy's got a good sense of style.
He's about the same age.

245
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:44,950
Got a nice crop of blond hair. We could
definitely use a blond in the crew.

246
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,159
Mix things up a little bit.
Why don't you just...

247
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,828
take a look at that flyer there?

248
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:51,864
Is this a penis?

249
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:53,832
A penis... No, it's a...

250
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,584
It's a bicep.

251
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,881
Oh, right. Party Mansion.

252
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:02,257
- Exactly.
- Cool.

253
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:03,967
I'll swing by.

254
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:05,816
- You'll swing by?
- Yeah, sure.

255
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,085
Just come by the address.
We'll be there partying.

256
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:11,308
- Yeah, at the Party Mansion.
- Yeah, you're gonna be perfect, man.

257
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,726
See you there.

258
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:15,125
Oh, I should give him
some more for his friends.

259
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:19,250
Oh, son of a bitch.

260
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:21,382
Penis? No, it's a bicep.

261
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:26,060
Bro, I just had the most perfect
blond guy slip right through my fingers.

262
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:29,340
I mean, I had him in the palm of my hand
and then... he was gone,

263
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,162
you know what I mean? This guy would
have been perfect for you.

264
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,231
What's up with this beefcake?
Is he coming to the party?

265
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,649
- Big time.
- Great.

266
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:39,012
- He didn't read the flyer.
- I read the flyer.

267
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,588
- He didn't understand it.
- I understood it... perfectly.

268
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,108
Okay, we need to take a
second look at this flyer.

269
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,812
- Uh, yeah, dude.
- Guys,

270
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:51,295
check out who I just met buying
a crossbow. This dude is the shit.

271
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:54,877
I shall use this crossbow to
pierce my broken heart.

272
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:55,994
Yeah.

273
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,435
All... right, dude.

274
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,777
Dude, is that guy awesome or what?
He's like a poet.

275
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:05,362
That guy's not awesome.

276
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:09,951
Dude, do you know how hard it is to find
a passionate guy like that these days?

277
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,144
They don't make 'em anymore.

278
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:14,059
You should see how passionate he got
when I showed him the dick flyer.

279
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:15,539
You knew that it was a dick?

280
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:18,333
Yeah, I thought we changed it.
I thought you were changing it.

281
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:20,326
It was always meant to be a bicep.

282
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,522
Then why did you cut it like...
'cause it looks totally like a dick.

283
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,383
I thought, let's go with the dick thing.
It's more masculine anyway.

284
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,887
I mean, shit, if you wanted it
to be a bicep, it needs more veins.

285
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:33,151
I can't wear this.

286
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,263
I got to go home get another costume.

287
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,254
There's no time.
Just sit down and shut up

288
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,078
and wait for Bruce
to get back the money.

289
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:40,804
All right.

290
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:43,574
But I can't promise
that I'm not going to go berserk

291
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,489
if he tries to give me AIDS again.

292
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,721
He wasn't trying to give you AIDS.

293
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:51,533
Jesus Christ, you're the one who's going
on and on about staying in character.

294
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,203
- Yeah, you're right.
- Look, we can do this, okay?

295
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:57,774
We've to go along with whatever
he throws at us. So close to that money.

296
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:59,246
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

297
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:00,709
I'm not gonna blow the cover.

298
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,058
Now pull your shit together, Seamus.

299
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:06,471
Surprise!

300
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:09,194
These are some of my adopted children.
Go ahead, guys.

301
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,942
This is your new home.

302
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:15,015
Mac, here come our guests. Come on.

303
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:18,060
How'd you get these guys again?

304
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,431
They're college kids.

305
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,807
Went to Penn, reeled them in
with a couple of white lies.

306
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:25,008
Now put your game face on, buddy.
We got a legacy to preserve.

307
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Here we go.

308
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,931
Welcome to the Party Mansion, bitches!

309
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:30,757
Get your asses in here.

310
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,187
Horseshit, huh?

311
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,906
- Yeah.
- Where is everybody?

312
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,579
- What about the chicks?
- Guess what,

313
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,008
Just you and us.
And we've got the Party Mansion.

314
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,389
And there ain't no rules
in the Party Mansion.

315
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:43,920
Check this out, bitches.

316
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,093
Oh, yeah, baby, nice one.

317
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:51,426
Let's stop being pussies
and let's fall on some beers.

318
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:53,336
- I don't drink.
- Wrong answer, bitch.

319
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,973
- You're a drinker tonight.
- You're gonna be telling stories

320
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:58,079
- about how crazy we are.
- You're gonna tell

321
00:14:58,135 --> 00:14:59,825
how we're like those guys
from Jackass...

322
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:02,182
how we like to smash stuff
and shove shit up our asses.

323
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,243
That's right.

324
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,857
You're gonna get so much shit
shoved up your ass tonight,

325
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,138
four-eyes.

326
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:10,821
You're going to be talking about
this night for the rest of your lives.

327
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,080
"Dear Diary...

328
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,946
"The dance was a total disaster.

329
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:20,036
"I cried myself
to sleep again last night.

330
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:25,168
"Mom forced me to wear the back brace
and all the school chanted

331
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,061
<i>"Aluminum Monster."</i>

332
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,131
Oh, man, Aluminum Monster,
that is hilarious.

333
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:33,093
No!

334
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,558
It's not hilarious.

335
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,483
I share this little girl's pain.

336
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,767
Have you ever been scorned, Charlie?

337
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,710
Uh, like all day, every day, dude.

338
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:46,311
Then you should think
of this little girl

339
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,793
as your soul mate of pain.

340
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,397
Oh, shit, bro.

341
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:59,828
Babysitting a bunch of orphans
was not part of our grift.

342
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,747
It's either that or digging up Mom.
Which for the record, I'm still into.

343
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,714
I willing to do whatever we need
to do to get this money, Frank, okay?

344
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:08,453
If we need to adopt
some orphans, fine.

345
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:10,130
We'll get the money and take them back.

346
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,966
Can you do that?
Is that possible?

347
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:16,428
I don't know. I'm sure they have
some kind of a return exchange policy.

348
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:17,855
That sounds good.

349
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,667
Great, now this one's sad.

350
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,018
Give her some money.

351
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:24,456
- What?
- Give her some.

352
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,475
I'm not giving shit.
What are you talking about?

353
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,357
May I speak to you two in the kitchen?

354
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:30,033
Oh, yeah.

355
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,820
You two have such a great vibe.

356
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,071
I'm ready to write a check right now.

357
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,698
But I just want to make sure
that I'm helping you to have,

358
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,269
like, the best relationship
that you can,

359
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,995
so that these kids
have a loving, stable home.

360
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,289
I know that this may sound weird,
but I've a lot

361
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:46,391
of training in family therapy,

362
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:49,481
and I think for me to help you,

363
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,420
I need to observe you
at your most intimate.

364
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,077
I need to observe you two making love.

365
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,485
How long's your boy
been passed out, bro?

366
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,019
I don't know, a couple of minutes.

367
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,605
I'm worried he's gonna wake up
before we throw him.

368
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,482
You kidding me? Look at him, he's out.

369
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:13,465
You're kidding? You're not really
gonna throw him down the stairs.

370
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:17,016
- We should throw him off the roof.
- Great idea, dude. I'm the thrower.

371
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:18,700
Why are you guys doing this?

372
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,325
It's what friends do, bro.

373
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:21,660
- No, it isn't.
- Guy,

374
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:23,691
his mom just died.
Can you have compassion?

375
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:24,843
My mom just died.

376
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:27,776
The least you could do is let us
throw your buddy off the roof.

377
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,721
"I'm totally going to tell
Eric how much I like him, tonight,

378
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,703
"even though Danielle was, like,
all over him today in school.

379
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,259
"Mother said: "Don't bother."

380
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,769
"He wants a pretty girl instead."

381
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,027
I can't stop crying, Ernesto.

382
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:51,914
Me neither, Charlie.

383
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,191
But...

384
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:55,215
don't fight it, Charlie.

385
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:59,526
It's all part of the healing process.

386
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:13,708
So tell me how do you two
usually begin your lovemaking sessions?

387
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,338
It's hard to say,

388
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:18,477
you know, because we start it

389
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,136
in so many ways.

390
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:24,475
Seamus, perhaps you should start by...

391
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,580
kissing her neck, lightly.

392
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,329
No. No, because, uh...

393
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,101
- we don't kiss.
- We don't kiss.

394
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,566
- At all.
- No kissing?

395
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:36,586
That's unusual, but okay.

396
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:40,947
Okay, tell me... just...
tell me what you are into.

397
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:44,493
I like to watch.
So I'm going to bounce off the bed

398
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:48,065
- and... observe.
- Okay.

399
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,333
See... you see what just happened, Dee?

400
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,001
Seamus has just communicated

401
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,585
what turns him on in a healthy way.

402
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:57,398
So...

403
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:01,551
Yeah, perhaps now would be a good time
for you to pleasure yourself for him.

404
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:04,596
And then, Seamus will mount you.

405
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:07,802
You know what,
I'm going to have to stop this.

406
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,479
Yeah, I gotta come clean here
because we've been lying to you.

407
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,315
Deandra, just think
about what you're doing.

408
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:18,132
I'm sorry. We've been lying.
The reason is...

409
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,885
we haven't had sex yet.

410
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,405
Because we're waiting
until we get married.

411
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,533
- We're waiting.
- We're saving ourselves.

412
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,922
It's so important to me and to him

413
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:33,620
to do that, and I think maybe,

414
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,050
that's what the tension is
that you're feeling.

415
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,879
- It's all sexual.
- Oh, it's so sexual.

416
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:39,806
I'm also a licensed minister.

417
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:43,437
So why don't we just do a wedding,
like, do it tomorrow.

418
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,470
I've been thinking,

419
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:48,515
and I should never give the money
to an unmarried couple anyway.

420
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:53,642
Okay.

421
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,650
Family and friends,

422
00:19:57,978 --> 00:19:59,825
we're gathered here to...

423
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,696
to share in the declaration
of a lifelong commitment

424
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,074
between this man and this woman.
Deandra,

425
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:10,036
do you take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

426
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:11,454
I do.

427
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:15,583
Seamus, do you take this woman
to be your wedded wife?

428
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:17,392
You betcha.

429
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,173
Well, then by the authority of God

430
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:22,896
and the laws of the great state
of Pennsylvania,

431
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:25,844
I now pronounce you man and wife.

432
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:27,906
Congratulations, Deandra.

433
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,264
You made me so happy.

434
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:31,182
You just married your daughter, Frank.

435
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,803
- You know who I am?
- Of course I know.

436
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:35,854
You're the little asswipe
who raised my children

437
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,914
and turned them into animals...
into monsters who...

438
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,739
who lie and steal
and take advantage of people

439
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:45,280
and contribute absolutely
nothing to society.

440
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,912
- Make sure you're getting this.
- Ernesto's missing this.

441
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,573
- He's got to see it.
- Go get him.

442
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,287
If you knew who he was,
why did you do the whole ceremony?

443
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,082
I was trying to push you two to your
limit. But apparently, you have none.

444
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,592
I hate to interrupt. I'm so sorry.

445
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:01,573
Bruce, can you just pronounce
them man and wife again?

446
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,069
I want to get that in a close-up.

447
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:06,205
Do the thing where you're like...
and yes, of course I know who you are.

448
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:07,953
And you were getting so angry...

449
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,221
Can you make them kiss
this time, though?

450
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:11,642
Yes, uh, sure.

451
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,458
May I see the camera for just a
second from this side, maybe?

452
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:16,978
- Sure.
- Yeah, yeah, uh...

453
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,974
I'm gonna give this to a lawyer
and you're gonna lose the house.

454
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,204
because you violated
the conditions of the will.

455
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:25,436
Frank was not to set foot in the house.

456
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,769
Bruce, come on.

457
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,685
Dad, be cool, man.
Like... let that slide.

458
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,035
You are acting
like a real bastard, Bruce.

459
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:34,037
You are the most horrible people alive.

460
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,123
- Oh, that's a little bit...
- That's a lot, that's a lot to say.

461
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,376
Man, don't be like that, dude.

462
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:42,004
Now I'm gonna lose the Party Mansion.
Thanks a lot, Frank.

463
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:45,340
- Whoa, guys, where you going?
- How did they get free?

464
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:48,943
- We were just having a little fun.
- You guys still wannna be our crew?

465
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,016
I don't think so.

466
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,615
I don't think they're gonna
tell about our adventures

467
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,182
and our glorious triumphs.

468
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:58,478
- Well, at least we still have Ernesto.
- No, he robbed your house.

469
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,213
Oh, son of a bitch.

470
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,726
I'm sorry that the grift
didn't work out, sweetie.

471
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,717
- We could still go get Mom's jewelry.
- I'll get the shovel.
