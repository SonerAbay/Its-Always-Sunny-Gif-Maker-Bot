Fight song! Go!

00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:16,889
Fight song!

00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,897
ALL: ♪ "Let's go to the downtown..."

Screw it.

14
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,713
That's a stupid song.

15
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:30,950
Oh, man, this reunion is
going to be awesome, dude.

16
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:33,555
I am going to fire into that
school, and it is gonna

17
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:36,759
propel me back into the mid-'90s when
Dennis Reynolds was a golden god.

18
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:41,067
Yeah. Oh, I'm so excited to show
these douche bags my new back.

19
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:43,904
No brace, fools! Baby got back!

20
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:46,908
♪ Oh-oh, baby got back. ♪

21
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,343
Dee, what are you doing?

22
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:49,077
Baby, got back.

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,146
You know that one.

24
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:50,814
Sir Mix-a-Lot.

25
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:52,317
♪ Baby got... ♪

26
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,620
Sir Mix-a-Lot was not talking
about women whose backs have

27
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,089
recovered from horrific
spinal disorder.

28
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:59,394
He was talking about gorgeous black women
and their big beautiful black butts.

29
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:00,295
FRANK: Black butts are good.

30
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:00,796
Whatever.

31
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:01,464
They're good, right?

32
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,499
Guess what. Baby got back, and
I can't wait to shove it

33
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,201
into these fools' faces,
so let's get going.

34
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:06,570
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

35
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,739
Let's just do what we always did
before every school-sponsored

36
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:10,540
event and let's...smash 'em up?

37
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,707
Let's smash 'em up!

38
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:16,329
Oh... Smash 'em up!

40
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:40,948
Hey, right?

41
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,949
I got these.

42
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,417
What, what are you
doing there, Charlie?

43
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,719
Huh? Oh, I'm packing a couple
extra pair of underwear in case

44
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,820
I get an atomic wedgie.

45
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:48,988
It's not gonna happen, dude.

46
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,722
We're adults now.

47
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,390
I'm not taking any
risks here, all right?

48
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,892
And if it does happen, I'm gonna
get high, I'm gonna go to the

49
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,326
bathroom, I'm gonna huff stuff.

50
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:57,561
No, Charlie, you don't have to
do things like that anymore.

51
00:01:57,563 --> 00:02:01,098
You don't need to huff shit or eat weird
things to get people to like you.

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,165
Nah, I think he does.

53
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,068
You guys were pretty much
nothing in high school.

54
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,637
If he wasn't the class clown and
you didn't sell drugs, you'd

55
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,605
definitely be nothing; nobodies.

56
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,941
Well, if shit happens, I'm
going directly to Plan B.

57
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:12,111
We're not gonna have
to do Plan B, okay?

58
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:14,347
You know, I'm gonna come right
out and say that I'm not

59
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,182
doing Plan B regardless of
what happens with you guys.

60
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,283
I'm only here for Plan B.

61
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,117
Oh, shit.

62
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,219
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

63
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,554
Faculty or alumni?

64
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:21,355
Neither one.

65
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,523
Well, you can't go in.

66
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:23,490
No, but we're friends.

67
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:24,024
We're buddies.

68
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:24,892
We hang out together.

69
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,859
We do everything together.

70
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:26,593
I don't care.

71
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,096
Okay, look, I'm gonna go inside
because, Frank, I can't

72
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:30,030
have you ruining this for me.

73
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:30,798
But what am I gonna do?

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,732
I don't know!

75
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,534
Hang out in the parking lot and
drink beer till we're done.

76
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,069
We smashed all the beers.

77
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:40,506
Oh, no, actually, I have a few more.
You guys want one?

78
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,008
You can't bring those inside.

79
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,276
Well, then guess what.

80
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:44,177
All right.

81
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,179
Smash 'em up!

82
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,180
(all laugh)

83
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:48,415
All right, turkey.

84
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,283
See ya, Frank.

85
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:52,086
See ya, jerk jerky.

86
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,221
Oh, yeah, baby, this is great.

87
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:55,557
This brings me back.

88
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,827
I'm anxious, I'm excited, I
can't wait to see the waitress.

89
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,828
Charlie, give it a rest.

90
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,329
I know, but we've been clicking lately.

91
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,864
This is gonna be a good night for us.

92
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,632
Like, remember how she was
the coolest girl in school?

93
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:05,700
What are you talking about?

94
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:06,400
No.

95
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,235
Well, she was definitely the
prettiest girl in school.

96
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,803
She was not. She was not, no.

97
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,304
Maybe the most forgettable
girl in school.

98
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,608
Yeah, which, by the way, is the worst
thing you could be in high school.

99
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,208
Totally insignificant.

100
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,244
Either way, good feelings
are gonna get sparked up.

101
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:18,778
I'm gonna see her, she's gonna see me.

102
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,979
You guys, you guys, you guys.

103
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:20,813
What?

104
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:21,748
Brad Fisher. Brad Fisher.

105
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,218
He is not gonna be happy to see
me after that present I gave him.

106
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,052
Uh, what present?

107
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,253
Oh, the box of hornets.

108
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,088
Ooh, that acne really
came back, didn't it?

109
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,855
Yeah, it sure did.

110
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:30,723
The guy looks like shit.

111
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,223
Mm-hmm.

112
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,124
All right, I tell you what.

113
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:34,794
Why don't you guys sneak past him, and
Mac and I will pick up the name tags.

114
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:35,294
Really?

115
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,028
How does that sound?

116
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,529
Yeah.

117
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:37,030
Okay.

118
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:37,797
We'll meet you inside.

119
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:38,297
Okay.

120
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,231
All right, go, go, go.

121
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,166
All right, come on.

122
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,636
Hey, hey, hey, it's
Brad Fisher, all right!

123
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:44,704
How you doing, buddy?

124
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:45,972
BRAD: Not great.

125
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:49,142
Oh, yeah, well, the acne definitely
came back in full force.

126
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,010
Yeah.

127
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:53,280
That's a shame, but I have products
that will clear that acne up, man.

128
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,481
It's not acne, actually.

129
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:56,015
No, no, it's hornet scars.

130
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:58,118
Ooh! Ouch. Yikes.

131
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,724
I don't think I have any products that'll,
that'll take care of hornet scars.

132
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,692
That's more of a...
Plastic surgery situation.

133
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:08,227
Yeah, plastic surgery
would do it, though.

134
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,828
Yeah.

135
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,430
But lasers... Lasers would do it.

136
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,498
They'd blast those monsters...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,633
You guys seen Charlie around?

138
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,133
Charlie Kelly?

139
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:14,901
Yeah.

140
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:15,769
No.

141
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:18,071
No, we don't, we don't
associate with him anymore.

142
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,740
All right, I'm gonna take off.

143
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:20,341
Okay.

144
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,108
Messy.

145
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,609
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

146
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,576
Let's stay out of that.

147
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:23,944
Yeah, let's stay out of that.

148
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,546
Let's just grab our name tags, huh?

149
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:26,514
I don't see 'em over here.

150
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,448
Oh, here we go.

151
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,785
Okay, we got Charlie, we got
Dee, I got myself right there.

152
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,586
Yeah.

153
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:34,089
And, uh, I'm not seeing yours.

154
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,057
Yeah, I grabbed mine already.

155
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:35,757
It's in my pocket.

156
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,725
Oh, did you grab it?

157
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,393
Yeah.

158
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,394
Oh, okay, well, pop it on.

159
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,430
Uh, I'm probably not gonna wear mine.

160
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,598
I mean, who wears a name tag, right?
That's not cool.

161
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,333
I'm gonna wear mine.

162
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:46,669
I'm seeing everybody else wearing their
name tags, so just pop that on, buddy.

163
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,070
Nobody calls me this anymore.

164
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:50,540
And I feel like it's
gonna confuse people.

165
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,542
It's not, because everybody
called you that in high school,

166
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,677
so pop it on because it's
definitely a rule and they're

167
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,112
not gonna let you inside without it.

168
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:57,013
It's been so long.

169
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:59,015
It's probably not even
my name legally anymore.

170
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:01,350
You're gonna have to pop it on.

171
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,553
(sighs) Okay.

172
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,555
(heart pounding)

173
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:17,363
Good. Well, okay, Ronald McDonald.

174
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:18,431
Don't call me that.

175
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, it's your name.

176
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,702
So, Ronald, I'm gonna take a
little lap around, get people

177
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:25,804
abuzz about my presence at the reunion.

178
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:28,774
And I'll meet up with
you guys later, okay?

179
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,743
(chuckles)

180
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:36,582
No one, no one calls me... ♪
♪

181
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,955
Is he looking?

182
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:43,623
Who? That guy?

183
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,258
Yes, is he looking at my back rig now?

184
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,559
Do you see the waitress anywhere?

185
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,227
Come on. Shut up.

186
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,561
He's not looking at your back, Dee.

187
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,062
Are you sure?

188
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,630
Why are you so obsessed with this guy?

189
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:51,898
It's Adriano Calvaniste, Charlie.

190
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,167
It's the guy who coined the
name "Aluminum monster."

191
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,102
Really? That's him?!

192
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,836
Yes.

193
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:56,536
That's cool.

194
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,571
I want to meet him.

195
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,539
You have met him, Charlie.

196
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,841
He called you Dirtgrub and
he made you eat spiders.

197
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:01,908
Oh, that guy!

198
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,476
Yeah.

199
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,644
Oh, he was, like, so cool.

200
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,180
He was, like, way above me.

201
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,515
Yeah, him and his cronies
all thought that they were

202
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:11,385
way above you and everybody else,
but I've got a plan to get revenge.

203
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:13,120
I'm gonna sew myself
into their inner circle.

204
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,221
Cool. How you gonna do that?

205
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:16,490
Well, I'm gonna lure 'em in
with my good looks, and then

206
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:19,226
as far as I remember, all you
really got to do to get in with

207
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,794
that crowd is be really
cruel to people.

208
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:21,294
Right.

209
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:23,997
So I'm gonna gain their trust and when
the moment's right, I'm gonna strike.

210
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,931
Oh, cool, all right.

211
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,065
I'm doing it for us, Charlie.

212
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,133
Oh, okay. Thanks. Yeah.

213
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,267
Mm-hmm. Is it, is it him?

214
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:28,868
He's coming over.

215
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,638
All right, do you see a spider I can eat?
I can eat a spider.

216
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,307
No, stop. Charlie, keep your
mouth shut, keep your...

217
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:38,077
ADRIANO: Hey, um, excuse me, but
aren't you the aluminum monster?

218
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,511
Yes. I mean, no.

219
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:41,513
People don't call me
that anymore, but yeah.

220
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,281
Nor should they.

221
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:45,484
I mean, wow, you've, uh,
you've really transformed.

222
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,053
You look great.

223
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:47,586
Really?

224
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:48,454
Mm-hmm.

225
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:49,589
Thanks.

226
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,891
Hey, Dirtgrub.

227
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:53,092
How are you?

228
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,194
That's so cool.

229
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,462
You're so cool, Adriano.

230
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,296
Yeah.

231
00:06:56,298 --> 00:07:00,667
Hey, um, why don't you smell this?

232
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,870
Well, it's probably poisonous, right?

233
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,839
Probably, but, you
know, smell it anyway.

234
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,673
Should-should I smell it?

235
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,408
Smell it.

236
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,545
Come on.

237
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:10,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie!

238
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,547
What are you doing, dude?

239
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:13,849
Oh, he wanted me to smell a pen,
and I was going to smell

240
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,220
the pen, because it's Adriano...
You don't have to do that anymore.

241
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,522
Hey, Ronald McDonald, right?

242
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:19,156
No, no.

243
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:21,859
For your information,
nobody calls me that.

244
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,593
Right, right.

245
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:23,727
What did we call you?

246
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:24,228
Ronnie the Rat.

247
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,497
Ronnie the Rat, yeah, I
remember, yeah, yeah.

248
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:27,832
Why did we call him that anyway?

249
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,800
'Cause he was a nark and a
tattletale, and he became the

250
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,868
main drug dealer when he told
on the other main drug dealer.

251
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,570
Right, yeah, yeah, I remember.

252
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,805
Well, looks like the rat got a
little too much cheese, huh?

253
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,507
Fat.

254
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,208
That's not funny.

255
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,875
I put on mass.

256
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:39,743
We eat a lot of cheese.

257
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:40,510
We eat a lot of cheese.

258
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,144
To put on mass.

259
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,746
Didn't you also give
everybody ringworm?

260
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:43,880
No, no.

261
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:44,581
That was a rumor.

262
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,283
I only gave ringworm to Charlie.

263
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,351
I got it from my dog Poppins,
and then Charlie and I were

264
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,353
wrestling every day because
we were trying out for the

265
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,290
wrestling team, and then, you know, we
just sort of passed it back and forth.

266
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:56,359
We passed it back and forth...
Although then we did try out

267
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,462
for the wrestling team, and then
I do think a couple of the guys

268
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:00,297
got it on the team, so yeah,
you're right, you're right.

269
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:03,866
Wow, yeah, yeah, no, that is really gross.
I mean, that is...

270
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,668
Yeah, that's about as low as it gets.

271
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,871
They probably still have it,
'cause they're so gay together.

272
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:08,771
Totally.

273
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:11,874
Hey, Dee, why don't you come back to
our table-- you know, have a drink?

274
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,608
Oh, yeah, okay.

275
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,242
Yeah?

276
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,243
That sounds cool.

277
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,278
See you later, Dirtgrub
and Ronnie the Rat.

278
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,981
Hope you suck each other's rotten
peckers until you get mouth cancer.

279
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:21,116
Mouth cancer.

280
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,284
Can I come to the table?

281
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,285
No!

282
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,520
For some reason, homophobia, it's
just, it's awesome to these

283
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,821
guys. I'm sewing myself in.

284
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:27,822
I'm doing this for us, okay?

285
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,457
What the hell is she talking about?

286
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,125
She's going to strike
when the moment's right.

287
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,059
She's doing it for us, dude.

288
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,060
Really?

289
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:33,895
Yeah.

290
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:34,495
Did you thank her?

291
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,330
Of course I thanked her, absolutely.

292
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:37,331
Oh, what's up, boys?

293
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:37,898
Hey.

294
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,433
All right, I got your name tags.

295
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,368
Oh.

296
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,736
Hey, did you get on Mac about his?

297
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,304
Yeah, he's got... It's not that...
It's not funny.

298
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,105
That's so funny.

299
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,407
Adriano came over,
blasted him about it.

300
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,008
Oh he did?

301
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,942
Oh, good, oh good.

302
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,043
So Adriano's probably going
to tell everybody about it.

303
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,478
That's going to get
around the whole reunion.

304
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,779
It'll get going round
and round and round.

305
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,279
Probably not.

306
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,147
Probably getting old already.

307
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,716
So listen, guys, this is where
we part ways, all right?

308
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:00,319
So do do not talk to me for the
rest of the night, and know that

309
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:01,920
I won't be talking to you,
because you lower my stock.

310
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:02,621
You guys get it.

311
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:05,391
I'm going to go post up one of
these tables around here, let my

312
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,594
loyal subjects come and kiss my ring.

313
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:11,273
Listen, don't laugh when
people make fun of me.

314
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,307
Yo, Stash.

315
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,075
Stash.

316
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,158
What's up, brother?

317
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:24,876
Dennis.

318
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:25,945
Sit down, man.

319
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,746
Let's catch up a little bit.

320
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:30,082
Okay, all right, I'll
catch you later, man.

321
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:32,418
Hey, if you see any of the old crew,
let them know I'm posted up over here.

322
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,287
I don't think they know I'm-- I'm here.

323
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,088
Dennis.

324
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,889
What are you...?

325
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,225
I snuck right by that security prick.

326
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,228
Look, I got myself a name tag.

327
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,562
I'm Nicki Potnick.

328
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:44,598
Remember the time he crashed
my car into the tree?

329
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
He went crazy and the tire went down...
We had such a good time.

330
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,302
Okay, Frank, first off, Nicki
Potnick is a girl, okay?

331
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,404
And secondly, she's not 65 years old.

332
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,638
I don't want to talk to you.

333
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,472
I don't want to be around you.

334
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:54,439
Go find Mac and Charlie.

335
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:54,973
Go, go, go.

336
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,975
Why-- why are you sitting
at a table with no people?

337
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:57,875
I thought you were cool.

338
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,909
I am cool.

339
00:09:58,911 --> 00:09:59,643
I'm the coolest kid here.

340
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:02,012
I'm just, you know, posting up,
and they're going to come to me.

341
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:02,979
I don't know what's going on.

342
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:04,481
MAUREEN: Hello, Dennis.

343
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:05,548
Whoa.

344
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,349
Oh, goddamn.

345
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:07,617
You're late on your alimony.

346
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:09,786
Can we not talk about
alimony payments right now?

347
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:10,753
We're at our reunion.

348
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:12,522
Didn't think you'd run
into your ex-wife, huh?

349
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,057
No, I didn't think about it, Maureen,
because I don't think about you.

350
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:15,625
Really?

351
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:16,192
No.

352
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,761
What do you think about this?

353
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:21,697
Oh, it wafted over here.

354
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:24,533
The dead tooth-- it spurted
in my nose, it stinks.

355
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:25,468
What is that supposed to be?

356
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,336
That's where your monthly
payments are going.

357
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:28,804
That's a diamond tooth, Dennis.

358
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:30,138
A dead tooth, Maureen.

359
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,506
With a diamond in it.

360
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,642
Put a diamond on anything
that's dead, and it's still

361
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:34,976
dead, Maureen. It's rotting.

362
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:35,977
Get it out of your face.

363
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,545
Look, I don't want to talk
about these things, all right?

364
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:39,747
I don't want to talk to old men
who are pretending to be women,

365
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:41,549
and-and ex-wives, all right?

366
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,517
I can't be seen like this.

367
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,286
Hello, bitches.

368
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:46,186
Oh, for...!

369
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,856
That's right, I'm off the wagon.

370
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:49,590
Yeah.

371
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:50,625
You know what, Dennis?

372
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,028
I went to go find my name tag--
they didn't have one for me.

373
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,062
Oh, really?

374
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:56,865
All right, see you later.

375
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:00,302
Yeah, I went to go find my name
tag-- they didn't even have one.

376
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:03,106
It's like-- it's like
what, I never existed?

377
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:04,474
I mean, who cares though, right?

378
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,241
'Cause it's high school.

379
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,243
Who cares?

380
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,786
(laughing)

381
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:19,354
Me, too.

382
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,288
Here we go, grab it.

383
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,256
Oh, yes!

384
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:26,027
Shots for everybody. Shots for the cool...
Oh, Rickety Cricket, everybody.

385
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,495
Look at this.

386
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,264
Rickety, rickety, rickety.

387
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,034
(blubbering)

388
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,068
(all laughing)

389
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,236
Rickety Cricket!

390
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,738
Cricks, how are you?

391
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,140
All cleaned up huh,
except for that tooth.

392
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,509
Well, actually it's Father Mara again.

393
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,410
Is it?

394
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:44,213
I cleaned up, yes, and I was
welcomed back into the cloth.

395
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:45,715
God had a plan for me.

396
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:48,051
Took me into a deep valley, but
now I'm soaring on eagle's

397
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:49,285
wings, so praise Him.

398
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:50,653
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,321
All that, street rat.

400
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:52,155
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:55,158
So I tell you what, Crick,
should I put my balls on your

402
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,193
chin now or later, huh?

403
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,728
Huh, huh?

404
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,129
Down the hatch, everybody.

405
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,932
Down the hatch, everybody...
but you, Father.

406
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:05,203
All right, well, nonetheless, I
say to you peace, peace be to

407
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,004
you, Deandra, okay?

408
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:06,771
That's weird.

409
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,640
And peace be to you, my lady.

410
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:12,211
And to you, my son, peace be to you.

411
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,979
To you.

412
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:17,784
Hey, hey, everybody, remember me?

413
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,386
Probably not.

414
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,688
Sat behind you in Spanish, remember?

415
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,458
Sat... sat right next
to you in Algebra one.

416
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,259
Who the hell is that?

417
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:25,892
Oh, I don't know.

418
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:27,394
I've never seen her before in my life.

419
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,328
Dee. Dee, you know me, Dee.

420
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,262
I know Dee.

421
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:31,664
Me and Dee, we go way back.

422
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,900
Bad choice on the dress,
know what I mean?

423
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,367
I know you, bitch.

424
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,804
I know you, bitch.

425
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,606
Oh, hey.

426
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,777
More shots, more shots, more shots,
more shots, more shots, more shots.

427
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,878
I'm the queen of the night.

428
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,915
I'm the queen of the night,
right, cool table?

429
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,918
♪ ♪

430
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,631
Wow, I just shook your dead tooth wife.

431
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,067
I mean, I had to wash
my hands and face.

432
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,702
I am trying to shake you, Frank.

433
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,837
It just smells so bad.

434
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,705
Please go away from me.

435
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,839
Please get away.

436
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,341
Yo, Dennis.

437
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,209
Oh, shit.

438
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,011
It's Tim Murphy. Son of a bitch.

439
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:17,845
Who's Tim Murphy?

440
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,882
Tim Murphy is the asshole
that slept with my prom date.

441
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,951
Dennis Reynolds, what's up, man?

442
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:24,452
Oh, hey, Tim.

443
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,486
This is my wife Christie.

444
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,121
Dennis and I used to be
really good friends.

445
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,589
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

446
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:29,924
Nicki Potnick.

447
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,124
Shut up.

448
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh, hey, honey?

449
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,026
Yeah?

450
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:34,094
Let's go dance.

451
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,228
Why don't you go ahead.

452
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,162
I'm going to hang for a bit.

453
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,530
Oh, okay.

454
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,065
Nice to meet you both.

455
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,001
Oh. Va-va-voom.

456
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,936
Anyhow, I saw you
standing over here alone.

457
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,838
I wanted to invite you
over to our table.

458
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,441
Oh, I won't be going
anywhere with you, Tim.

459
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,342
Okay, why?

460
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:53,346
Don't you play coy with
me, you little bitch.

461
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:57,484
I'm going to stay right here, and I'm
going to wait for my minions to swarm me.

462
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,021
And swarm they will, Tim.

463
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,890
Alone you'll be.

464
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:02,824
Ha.

465
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:07,095
Such sad little games we play.

466
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,264
Right, Tim?

467
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,365
Right.

468
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,901
Same old Dennis Reynolds.

469
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,168
You look good, Nicki.

470
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,336
Thank you, Tim!

471
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:17,303
Mm.

472
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,004
Thank you.

473
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:18,972
Seems like a nice guy.

474
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:20,073
He's not. Go!

475
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,807
Go away from me!

476
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,033
We just got to get our mojo back.

477
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah.

478
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,402
Get some drinks in us, and...
Confidence, yeah.

479
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,151
Six beers, for the two of us, please.

480
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,407
Drink tickets for the
two of us, please.

481
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,208
Oh, all right.

482
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,243
Here.

483
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,244
Dude, this is only four.

484
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,213
That's all they gave us, bozo.

485
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,882
Well, that's only two per person, bozo.

486
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:44,886
Well, how am I supposed to get drunk
off of only four beers? I, I...

487
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,956
Is there any way you can work something out?
Or... Two tickets per person, guy.

488
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,123
I didn't ask you, pretty boy.

489
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,225
It's a conversation between
me and the longhair.

490
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:51,926
Okay.

491
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:53,961
None for him, or the fat bitch.

492
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:54,895
(laughing)

493
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:55,829
You making this about weight?

494
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:56,830
He's gained a lot of weight.

495
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,965
I'm not going to take some
shit from some bartender.

496
00:14:58,967 --> 00:14:59,966
You're a bartender.

497
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:00,700
He doesn't know that!

498
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:02,436
Hey, did you guys see
Ronald McDonald's his name?

499
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:03,437
(laughing)

500
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,438
Hey!

501
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,472
Eight beers, my friends.

502
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:06,307
What's up, buddy?

503
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,675
How are you? Boom!

504
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:08,342
Hey, buddy.

505
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:09,009
Whoa.

506
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,545
I thought it was only two per person!

507
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:12,614
The, uh, computer lab printed
out like a hundred of them.

508
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,215
Way more than I need.

509
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:14,916
That's awesome.

510
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:15,684
Can we get a few of them?

511
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,052
No. No way.

512
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:18,520
I, I'm sorry I brought it up, man.

513
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:19,188
Yeah.

514
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,589
Hey, Adriano, can I get
some more of those tickets?

515
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:21,924
Yeah, you bet. Here.

516
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:22,591
Help yourself.

517
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:23,259
Awesome.

518
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:23,926
Son of a bitch!

519
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:24,726
He just gave them to that guy.

520
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:28,330
Well, that guy's cool, so...
Okay, I got an idea, man.

521
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:29,964
I got a, I got an
excellent plan, Charlie.

522
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:32,199
We're going to get everything we
need, we're going to get our

523
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,934
confidence back, and we're going
to fire back into this room.

524
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:34,634
You ready?

525
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:35,301
Okay, good.

526
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:35,969
Here we go.

527
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:36,703
I want those guys to like us.

528
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:37,537
Follow my lead.

529
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,538
Okay.

530
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,705
Adriano made fake tickets.

531
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:40,673
Those tickets are fake!

532
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:41,440
Don't rat on him!

533
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,843
But he made fake ones, and he
gets to drink and we don't.

534
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,511
That's not fair!

535
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:46,512
Bro, I'm sorry.

536
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:48,747
If those are fake, you can't
get any of these beers.

537
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,448
Come on.

538
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,115
(Mac laughs)

539
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:50,916
You got in trouble.

540
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,017
You got in trouble!

541
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,752
Wow. Ronnie the Rat strikes again, huh?

542
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,520
Thanks a lot, douchebag.

543
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:56,388
You're the worst, Dirtgrub.

544
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,055
Yeah.

545
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,191
I didn't have anything to do...
Don't sell me out.

546
00:15:59,193 --> 00:15:59,891
See what you did, man?

547
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,426
We're supposed to be on
the same team, Charlie.

548
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,427
Aw... see, high school sucks!

549
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,128
You know what?

550
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,096
I'm going to go to the bathroom,
I'm going to find stuff to huff,

551
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:05,796
I'm going to get high.

552
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,932
If I'm the Dirtgrub, I'm going
to be the Dirtgrub.

553
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,001
(Mac sighs in exasperation)

554
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,869
We're going to go into Plan B.

555
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:16,106
Because I brought Dee's old back
brace, and I got it in the car.

556
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,675
So, we can implement... Not now, Frank!

557
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,379
A little rehearsal or something.

558
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,081
No, Charlie, dude, you
don't have to do this.

559
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,015
We can find another way.

560
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:25,749
Yes, I do!

561
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,351
I'm just the Dirtgrub, okay?

562
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,453
Everyone wants the Dirtgrub,
I'll give 'em the Dirtgrub.

563
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,055
I'll get high, I'll get sad.

564
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,056
People can laugh at me.

565
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,124
I hate high school, man.

566
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,927
Charlie, Charlie, don't put the
bleach and the ammonia together!

567
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,630
It's going to knock
the shit out of you.

568
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,264
Don't tell me how to
mix my own inhalants!

569
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,499
I know how to do inhalants.

570
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,134
Charlie, it's going to
knock you unconscious.

571
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,869
Okay, I know how to do
my own inhalants, okay?

572
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:47,038
I don't need that from... God.

573
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,939
Whoops-a-daisy.

574
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:48,607
That's it.

575
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:49,308
All right.

576
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,743
Well, let's just wait till he wakes
up, and then we'll... Oh, wow.

577
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,011
What do we got here?

578
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,681
Ronnie the Rat and, uh...
Hey, look, everyone, Nicki

579
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,615
Potnick made it to the reunion.

580
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,282
(laughing)

581
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,083
Hello.

582
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,918
Looks like you had a rough
couple of years, there, Nicki.

583
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,321
Uh, yeah. I'm a guy now.

584
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,323
Mm. Right. Yeah.

585
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,824
What are you guys doing, perving
out on Dirtgrub over there?

586
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,226
Yeah, probably.

587
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,628
That's what these gay guys do, they just...
knock each other

588
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,165
out with poppers, and then find
some kinda rabies-infested

589
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,401
rodent to tickle each
other's taints with.

590
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,703
(laughing)

591
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,172
No. No, that's not what
we're doing, all right?

592
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,273
We are grown adults.

593
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,275
We are respected businessmen now.

594
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,145
You did kind of rat me out there, Ronnie, so...
Yeah, so, I guess it's time

595
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,880
to pay the piper, Rat.

596
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,416
And, uh... old man I don't know.

597
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,417
Whoa! No, no!

598
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:32,551
What the hell are...?!

599
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,886
(yelling)

600
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:34,587
Ah!

601
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,155
Ow!

602
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:40,492
I've been waiting a long time for this.

603
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,894
You know me!

604
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:44,330
Oh, God!

605
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,667
I'm a grown, goddamn man!

606
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,769
(yelling)

607
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,240
♪ ♪

608
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,643
You should stay away from those people.

609
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:59,246
I mean, they-they will ruin your
life like they tried to ruin mine.

610
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:00,514
Oh!

611
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:03,518
You guys just missed something
so awesome that we did.

612
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,952
Heed my warning.

613
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,287
Hey, how you guys doing?

614
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,389
Yeah. I'm here.

615
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,757
Can you believe I came to this thing?

616
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,026
Yeah, I was posted up over there, I
guess you guys probably didn't see me.

617
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:12,693
No, we saw you.

618
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:13,494
Oh, did you?

619
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:15,528
Oh, okay, well...
no reason to be intimidated.

620
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,262
You know?

621
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:18,031
I'm a human being, after all.

622
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:19,766
You know, just a... just a man.

623
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:20,633
Actually, we're good.

624
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,535
Uh, no, Tim. We're not good.

625
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,304
And you're definitely not good,
because you haven't had the

626
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,706
chance to hang out with me yet.

627
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,409
Um... my wallet's missing.

628
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:31,510
Oh my God, my necklace is missing.

629
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,112
Come on!

630
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,513
My gold chain's gone.

631
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:37,082
Have you seen my necklace?

632
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,083
Oh, my.

633
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,617
And with all the security.

634
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,053
The fact you even need it...
Wait a second, Mara.

635
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,388
What is that around your neck?

636
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,290
Hmm?

637
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,294
Oh, that's, uh... probably just a ar that...
What the hell?

638
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:50,696
Ah.

639
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:53,133
(people exclaiming)

640
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,534
Ah!

641
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:55,702
I've sinned!

642
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,738
My God, you are covered in ringworm.

643
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,772
It's her fault.

644
00:18:58,774 --> 00:18:59,773
She told me she loved me.

645
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,042
We were supposed to
be together forever.

646
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:03,043
Calm down, Cricks.

647
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:03,877
What's he talking about?

648
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:04,711
Dee, were you two together?

649
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:06,246
No! Me, with him?

650
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:08,249
I... what are you, crazy? No!

651
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:11,519
Yeah, I told him I loved him once,
but that was like four years ago.

652
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,254
You two probably have
ringworm together, don't you?

653
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,188
No!

654
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,956
No, of course I don't have ringworm!

655
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,790
No no no, stay away from me!

656
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,559
To think I was going to let you jack me off...
Wait wait... you were?

657
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,727
Unbelievable.

658
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:21,795
Get this asshole out of here.

659
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:22,729
Come on.

660
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:23,764
No, no!

661
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:24,598
Come on, move, come on.

662
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Hey, you know I don't
have ringworm, right?

663
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:27,234
You guys.

664
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:27,968
No, we don't have ringworm.

665
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,669
I don't have ringworm.

666
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:29,436
No, no, we're cool!

667
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,891
Yeah, we're like the... Oh, really?

668
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,168
Oh, son of a bitch.

669
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:36,111
(sighs)

670
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:41,741
