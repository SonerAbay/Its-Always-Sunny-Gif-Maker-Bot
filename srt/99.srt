00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:05,659
This place has got the
best hot dogs in Philadelphia.

2
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:08,911
Once you nosh on these, you're
not gonna want to eat another

3
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:10,879
- hot dog after this.
- Might as well get some

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,714
- snacks while we're here.
- I'm getting a beer.

5
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:14,716
Don't grab a beer.
We're on our way to a bar,

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:15,468
which we own.

7
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,528
I'm gonna get a beer, too.
Are you serious?

8
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,421
Anyone else?
Yeah, I'll have a beer.

9
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:20,923
Of course I want a beer.
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,691
All right, well, I'm not
gonna be the only one not

11
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,593
drinking beer, so come on.
Don't move!

12
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:29,097
Oh, sh... Open
the register. Open it!

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,233
Oh, shit, oh, God, we're all
gonna die.

14

Do it fast, or I'll blow your

- Okay.

21
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,628
- Give me the money.
- Hey, bozo.

22
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,747
Walk away now, and I let you live...
or stick around and

23
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,450
repent for your sins.

24
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:28,819
You better step your ass back.

25
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,221
And you better say "cheese."
Huh?

26
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:41,398
Crisis averted.
Holy shit!

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Mac, that was amazing!
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,302
Did you like my "say cheese"
line?

29
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:47,304
I didn't quite get that, if
I'm being honest.

30
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,239
Yeah, I was a little bit
confused by that as well.

31
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,175
It was a pun, 'cause I flung
cheese in his face, you know?

32
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,178
No, I got that, but... Yeah, but-but
that's not really a pun. No.

33
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,913
No, if you... if you had
taken his photograph, and then

34
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,448
you flung cheese in his face...
There it is.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,416
...that would be a pun.
Yeah, you're taking the guy's

36
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,185
picture, you say, "Say cheese!"
That would've done it.

37
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,653
Should I go get a camera?
You know what?

38
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,455
Yeah, he's missing the point.
It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,524
What you just did was badass.
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,527
Now let's take a look at who
this scumbag is.

41
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:15,799
Oh, sh... oh, shit.

42
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,801
Yakuza.

43
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,269
Go, go!
Oh, shit!

44
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,538
Oh, my God.

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,046
Hyah!
Hyoh!

46
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:39,349
Mac, watch out!

47
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:47,691
Hah!

48
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:50,894
Yah!

49
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,230
Hyah!

50
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:20,991
- Very impressive. Your technique...
- is impeccable.

51
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:29,666
Cool off.
Yo, Mac, that was amazing.

52
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,502
And that's a great pun, dude.
You used the pun right!

53
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,270
Yeah, you got the pun right,
dude.

54
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,938
Huh?
What pun?

55
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,673
The... "Cool off" and you
kicked him in a fridge.

56
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,509
He's not getting it, is he?
No, he's not. Forget it.

57
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,943
Don't worry about it.
What is a pun?

58
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,779
You know, move past it.
I'll take his photograph.

59
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,750
No, no. What the hell is the matter with you?
Why would you do that?

60
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,354
I killed the boss. That's not the
boss, you idiot. He's my father!

61
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,357
He owns the store!
Whoops.

62
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,159
My bad.
Now, is your throat okay?

63
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,927
Is it... is that from the smoke,
or...?

64
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:02,166
Is that a pun?

65
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,468
Oh, my God, Mac!

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,336
No!

67
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,940
Mac, Mac, Mac. We're sorry for
doubting your awesomeness. Yeah.

68
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,342
I can't live without you.
Don't die.

69
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:22,119
I... don't... forgive you.

70

No!

71
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,358
No, no...
Why?

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,062
Why?

73
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,865
I love you!
Why?

74
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:40,771
I love you!

75
00:05:40,773 --> 00:06:12,769
God?
Hello, Mac.

76
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,572
Those were some pretty sweet
moves.

77
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,574
Thank you, my Lord and Savior.

78
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:20,878
Won't you join me?
Is that seat for me?

79
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,714
You're goddamn right it is.

80
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:35,559
Oh, hey, Rex.

81
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,328
'Sup, bro?
So what do we do now?

82
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,132
Now we ignore everyone's
prayers.

83
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:49,172
Put the money in the bag.
Do it fast, or I'll blow your

84

brains out!
What are we gonna do?

85

Damn it, Dee, this is all
your fault.

86

What?
It's because of you.

87
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,953
How is this my fault?
It just is, you stupid bitch.

Guys, you thinking what I'm
thinking?

Let's sacrifice her.
What?

90
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,659
Sir, sir!
Please, take her, take her!

91

Have your way with the whore!

92
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:19,136
Oh. Let me blow these assholes away.
No, no, wait, wait, wait,

93
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,138
please, please!
Please, don't shoot my friends.

94
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Listen, listen to me.
Just give me the gun, okay?

95
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,142
We'll work something out.
Just give me the gun.

96
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,511
Give it to me.
There you go.

97
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,513
Oh, Dee!
Dee did it!

98
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,515
You saved our lives!
You saved the day!

99
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,718
You're the hero.
I'll see you in hell, boners.

100

No witnesses.
I like your style.

101
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,999
We should team up. Us ladies need
to stick together. I tell you what.

I got your back.
For life.

103
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,671
She did it.
What?

104
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,207
You bitch!
You're dead!

105

Miss Reynolds?

mother's no longer with us.
